<p>It is evident that there is hardly a difference of around 10-20fps in the gameplay of graphics intensive games in both these segments of laptops. Moreover, all three games are playable on the Acer Predator Helios 300 in ultra settings with fps ranging around 60-70fps, and that is not at all disappointing. Moreover, you can scale down a few settings to add up of about 10-15fps for more smoother gameplay.</p>

<p>Well, a&nbsp;gaming laptop under 1000 dollars can do most of the tasks efficiently, but&nbsp;a laptop priced at around 1500 dollars can provide a better graphics output and performance. That said, if you are a kind of user who needs the most from a device and needs a <a title="The Best Laptops for CAD – Our Most Recommended Laptops for AutoCAD &amp; SOLIDWORKS" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-cad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop&nbsp;to work on CAD</a>&nbsp;or any other intensive applications like&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Premiere&nbsp;and Sony Vegas to edit videos</a>, the higher specced device will be a good fit, provided you have a budget of around $1500.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-laptops-notebooks/alienware-m17-r2-laptop/spd/alienware-m17-r2-laptop?~ck=bt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5940 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Alienware-m17.jpg" alt="Alienware m17 Gaming Laptop" width="550" height="360"></a></p>
<p>Here comes the best pure gaming based laptop in the list, the Dell Alienware m17. Alienware series of laptops from Dell are very well renowned in the market for their impeccable and uninterrupted gaming performance.</p>
<p>This is the newest Alienware 17.3-inch laptop which sports a 1080p IPS display with brightness up to 300-nits. It can satisfy almost all the core laptop users including the hardcore gamers. The laptop is powered by the newest 9th generation Intel core i7 processor clocked up to 4.5GHz. Multitasking on the laptop is driven by a 16GB of fast DDR4 RAM which is ample for playing games and in case if you need more RAM then it also has an extra slot to upgrade the RAM up to 32GB. As far as storage is concerned, it has a spacious 512GB SSD which will be sufficient for most gamers however, if you want more storage then storage drives are easily accessible to upgrade.</p>
<p>Graphics on this laptop are also very well managed. It has Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card with 6GB of DDR6 memory. This laptop can run all the latest games without any problem, and it manages to stay cool all the times hence it has managed to top our list of the best gaming laptops under 1500 dollars.</p>
<p>The only downside — Alienware m17 has huge dimensions and it weighs around 6 pounds which makes it hard to travel with and carry to different places. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a smaller and portable gaming laptop, then you should probably check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/gaming-laptops-desktops/new-alienware-m15-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alienware m15</a> which is equally powerful and far more portable than the Alienware m17.</p>

<p>Razer has a well-established portfolio in the field of thin and light gaming laptops. The laptops from this manufacturer are very well-renowned to possess solid configuration in a very slim MacBook like chassis.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the recently launched 2019 Razer Blade 15 comes heftily loaded with the powerful configuration in just a 0.7-inch thick chassis which weighs just 4.4 pounds. The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch full HD display with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">100% sRGB coverage</span> which makes it unique in the segment. The device is powered by the latest and greatest 9th generation Intel Core i7 six-core processor paired with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of HDD and 256GB of SSD storage. Graphics on this laptop is backed by a powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q GPU which is hard to believe considering the overall size and weight of the notebook. Moreover, the laptop doesn&#8217;t even compromise with the connectivity options. Its thin profile accommodates 3 standard USB 3.1 ports, 1 USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 support, a Mini Display port, a full-sized HDMI and even Gigabit Ethernet jack!</p>
<p>It comes with a clean copy of Windows 10 Home pre-installed with zero bloatware which is something you expect when you pay premium. Moreover, it has two front facing speakers which delivers an excellent multimedia experience. On a conclusive note, the Razer Blade 15 is a lightweight gaming beast which although costs a little more than $1500, we think it&#8217;s still a great value for money machine for professional gamers and content creators.</p>

The Sager-15 is their recently launched gaming laptop which comes packed with newest Intel processor and Nvidia GPUs. The laptop comes with a black brushed matte finishing throughout and features an aluminum lid with a minimal looking Sager logo which adds on to the elegance of the laptop.

It provides a decent amount of storage with 512GB of SSD and there&#8217;s also an empty storage drive bay to put an another HDD or SSD inside.</p>
<p>On a full charge, the laptop can outlast for slightly more than 5 continuous hours, which is a decent backup considering the configuration it packs in and its 15-inch full HD IPS 144Hz display. Sager NP8957 15&nbsp; has thus managed to creep into our list of best gaming laptops under $1500.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design, there isn’t much of an upgrade here. Having said that, the 2018 Helios 300 looks exactly identical to the last year’s model.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Helios 300 at the very first glance looks to be much thinner and compact than that of the other laptops in the segment. However, when you hold the device and start using it, you’ll realize that it, in fact, is on a bulkier side. The device comes with a dimension of 10.47 x 15.35 x 1.05 inches, which is a little wider and thicker for a 15-inch laptop. The device weighs slightly over 5.5 pounds and can be quite cumbersome to carry around. However, considering the fact that it is a gaming laptop and has a lot of engineering within, it might not be an issue for most of us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Design" width="650" height="406" /></p>
<p>Acer this time has come up with newer color variants, to give gamers a choice. It has unveiled the special edition Acer Predator Helios 300, which comes clad in a white-and-gold chassis. However, we still don&#8217;t know when it will hit the stores.</p>
<p>The one which we tested looks just like its predecessor and has the same angular design going all around with red and black color scheme. Its aluminum lid has a huge Predator logo and a red lining on either side which gives it a proper gaming hue, however, it doesn&#8217;t light up like Alienware and some <a title="All MSI Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/msi-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end MSI laptops</a>.</p>
<p>Most gamers would love the design of this laptop, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an out of the box gaming laptop design, then the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) might not please you that much.</p>
<div id="attachment_3941" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Lid-design.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 - Lid design" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Premium looking Metal Lid with Huge Predator Logo and Red Lines on Either Side</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the build quality, there is a lot of plastic used in the making of chassis of this laptop. However, there are no compromises with the build quality and laptop feels very solid to hold. Moreover, it comes with a pretty ergonomic form-factor making it subtle to carry around and use.</p>
<p>As far as ports and slots are concerned, they are neatly recessed on both sides of the laptop and they are smartly placed in a way that wired gaming mouse won&#8217;t hinder your gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Almost all the Acer Predator series of laptops come with a short-stroke keyboard, which might not often be preferred for gaming. The keys on the Helios 300, comes with a travel of the only 1.2mm into the frame on a press, which is not much. This affects the tactile feedback on the keyboard. However, this doesn’t hold true for regular usage including documents editing and other general tasks.</p>
<p>However, the gamers will like the keys on the device as they are very brightly backlit and come in non-changeable red color hue to match the styling. The keys come with a slight curve, which adds on to the typing experience nonetheless.</p>

<p>Speaking about the trackpad on the device, it is made out of plastic and evidently, one can feel that right away. Although the tactile feedback and the touch sensitivity on the trackpad are fine-tuned, we felt the lack of richness, we ought to get on gaming laptops over $1000. However, it can still take up all the everyday essentials with ease without dropping a sweat.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD widescreen display and it is an IPS LED-backlit panel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What makes it unique though is its fast 144Hz refresh rate</span>. Meaning, the rapid refresh rate shortens the time it takes for frame rendering and provides gamers with an excellent in-game experience. This helps especially when you’re gaming or watching the high-quality video files.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3946" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-PH315-51-78NP-144Hz-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP) 144Hz Display Review" width="900" height="667" /></p>
<p>The display can get bright up to 300 nits and produces a decent 70% NTSC and 90% sRGB color gamut on the scale, making it good enough for content creators. We also played some 4K content on the laptop, and the details were very precise, that we could see every minute detail played.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops for Photo Editing with Most Color Accurate Display</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Overall, the display on the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) gaming laptop is one of its unique selling points and without a doubt, it is one of the best display-equipped mid-range gaming laptop available to buy right now.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the hardware of the device, Acer Predator Helios 300 comes with powerful innards, which makes it one of the latest in the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segment of mid-range gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by a latest 8th gen Intel Core i7-8750H hexa-core processor with clock frequency of up to 4.1GHz and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 video memory. The duo of this CPU and GPU makes it one of the most powerful and value for money gaming laptops available for the asking price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops</a> (8th Gen)</strong></em></div></div>
<p>For multitasking, the laptop has a huge 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of PCIe based NVMe SSD. Although this might not be sufficient to store huge data, be mindful, the SSD storage offered in this laptop is at least 4 times faster than that of the traditional HDD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_3947" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Hardware-and-Upgradability.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-78NP Hardware and Upgradability" width="800" height="546" /><p id="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>New Dual Fan Cooling System | Easy to upgrade RAM (Up to 32GB) and Storage</strong> <em>&#8211; Image taken from Dave Lee YouTube Channel</em></p></div>
<p>To the gamers rejoice, hardware on the Predator Helios 300 is quite easy to upgrade. The laptop&#8217;s back panel gives access to its two RAM slots one of which is empty and it also has an empty storage drive bay inside to upgrade its low storage with the hard drive or another SSD. The WiFi card is also easily accessible but we don&#8217;t think it needs to be changed as the Gigabit card that the laptop comes equipped with, works flawlessly and provides excellent WiFi reception.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming stationed laptop, we expect a lot of additional peripherals to be connected to the device. Accordingly, the Helios 300 comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C port which can support speeds of up to 5GBps. It also sports a USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports. There is an HDMI 2.0 port to plug in the additional display if needed. The HDMI port available comes with HDCP support. Apart from these, it also comes with a microSD card reader, an RJ45 Ethernet port, headphone jack, and a charging port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ports-and-Slots-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="800" height="367" /></p>
<p>The only disappointment here is its USB Type-C port which doesn&#8217;t support the Thunderbolt 3. We expected this year&#8217;s model with Thunderbolt 3 as the last year&#8217;s model didn&#8217;t had it. However, it isn&#8217;t a huge problem if you don&#8217;t plan to use the External GPU or other Thunderbolt accessories.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We spent a decent time gaming and doing other mediocre to demanding tasks on this laptop. The laptop stood up to the expectations and did well in terms of providing reliable performance and efficiency. We tested the laptop by <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rendering video</a> on the Adobe Premiere and even played some AAA games at high graphics settings. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop was able to handle our multitasking and gaming tests quite easily.</p>
<p>A gaming laptop is often discredited due to its heating issues but to our surprise, this year&#8217;s Acer Predator Helios 300 did well in terms of thermal management, despite having powerful CPU and GPU inside it. Thanks to its new all-metal dual AeroBlade fans and huge exhaust vents at the back, the laptop dissipates all the inside heat out and allows CPU and GPU to work at its full potential.</p>
<p>The data transfer speeds and superfast app loading speeds are yet another impressive aspects of this laptop. Its 256GB PCIe NVME SSD doesn&#8217;t offer adequate room, but it does help in reducing the bootup times and load times of games and other applications.</p>
<p>Speaking about the benchmarks, we ran a couple of benchmark tests on the laptop to find out its actual potential. Accordingly, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (with i7-8750H and GTX 1060) scored a good P13214 on the 3DMark 11 and a 19800 on multi-core and 4560 on single-core tests via Geekbench 4 64-bit. These scores are on par with most of the other offerings in the segment which makes the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) again king of the mid-range gaming laptops segment.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>All credits to the powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics baked in, the Helios 300 does deliver exceptionally well-performance for the mid-range gaming stationed laptop. We had a good time playing games on it and even at the highest graphics settings, laptop managed to deliver the respectable framerates. However, the fans get quite vocal while gaming and its battery lasted for just 58 minutes in our gaming tests.</p>

<p>The laptop also supports virtual reality, but GTX 1060 isn&#8217;t the best GPU you can get for the VR related tasks. We tested its VR capabilities by playing some VR games, and the laptop managed to run all of them. However, the experience wasn&#8217;t the smoothest and GPU did felt a bit underpowered for VR. But, the GPU is overclockable and overclocking does reduce the lag up to an extent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Like the last year&#8217;s model, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 also comes with the same dual stereo speakers located on the bottom front of the laptop. They are backed by the Acer’s proprietary Acer TruHarmony audio tech and Dolby Audio premium, which claims to enhance the audio quality. However, the audio isn&#8217;t the loudest and its sound gets suppressed due to the bad placement of speakers.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#b3b3b3;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#cdcdcd;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You May Like to Check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life on the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is definitely not the main selling point as it comes with the same 4-cell Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery that we saw in the last year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the laptop can provide up to 7 hours of continuous usage, during our real-time usage, we managed to sustain the battery for close to 4 hours with normal usage. However, while gaming the battery life dropped to a mere 58 minutes which is tad disappointment and less as per the gaming laptop&#8217;s standards of 2018. Moreover, it takes up to two and a half hours to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>So, battery on the new Predator Helios 300 is another thing after design, Acer has used to cut manufacturing costs, and that can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If one is looking for a powerful mid-range gaming laptop, then the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is our top pick right now. It checks a lot of right boxes with its segment first 144Hz display, powerful and latest hardware, and a rather old yet good built chassis. However, a bit heavy form factor, small battery and a 256GB of SSD might be a bit of concern for few. But it&#8217;s hard to find an alternative to this laptop, especially for the price that it comes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS was one of the very first brands among all the traditional laptop makers, to step into the gaming arena and challenge the pioneers like MSI and Alienware series of laptops. It all started with the ROG (Republic of Gamers) series of laptops from ASUS, which was not only priced competitively but was also a very good all-around performer. Soon after the company started to earn fame and reputation in the gaming arena, it started to release a series of laptops with the primary emphasis on gaming to attract a large audience.</p>
<p>Our current laptop, the ASUS FX502VM Gaming Laptop is one among the newly launched gaming series of laptop from ASUS, which is now one of the most selling gaming laptops at around $1000. The laptop does pack in some interesting set of specifications and also packs in a lot of additional features. We were initially surprised to hear about the intelligent thermal design and several other futuristic features of the laptop and therefore, decided to have a look at it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM looks thick and hefty right from the very first look. However, the laptop is very finely engineered and ergonomically built. The laptop comes with a curved chassis as seen on the ROG series with imposed curves with an ASUS logo imposed on the lid. The laptop is thick at the centre and gradually gets narrower towards the edges.</p>
<div id="attachment_1852" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-image-1852 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png" alt="Asus FX502VM Gaming Laptop - Dimensions" width="469" height="550" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png 469w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-256x300.png 256w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-43x50.png 43w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t see gaming laptops this thin more often!</p></div>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15.4 x 10.5 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weights around 4.9 pounds, which although isn&#8217;t that hefty for a gaming laptop, still feels a little cumbersome to carry around.</p>
<p>Both the sides of the laptop are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The laptop comes in matte finished colour giving a perfect gaming hue to the users. As soon as you open the lid, you see a very aggressive looking futuristic keyboard. The keyboard on the laptop comes with red backlit keys, which adapts a theme according to the game we play. Moreover, the trackpad on the laptop is also spaciously arranged in the body, giving it a perfect ease of usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_1853" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1853" class="wp-image-1853 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Keyboard-Touchpad" width="800" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad.png 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-300x155.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-768x396.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-610x314.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-600x309.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1853" class="wp-caption-text">Chiclet keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys offers 1.6mm tactile key strokes.</p></div>
<p>All in all, the ASUS FX502VM comes with a finely engineered futuristic design. The laptop feels really sturdy but is, unfortunately, slightly heavy to carry around.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000 for Pro-Gamers</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Our ASUS FX502VM features a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. With these numbers kept in mind, it is quite vibrant enough for movies and games. As soon as we started testing out the laptop, we played some 4K content on it, to which the laptop’s display responded really well. When watching a 4K trailer of injustice: Gods among us, all the colours popped up really well with high colour gamut. Moreover, the viewing angles on the laptop are also really great and can easily cover over 160-degrees without getting smudged.</p>
<p>Our lab tests also proved the ASUS FX502VM’s impressive colour performance. The laptop managed to produce 184.7 percent of the sRGB colour gamut, which is by far one of the best we measured. That not only means that this display is bright and colourful, but also means that it is accurate than most of its rivals in the price segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_1855" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-image-1855 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Display" width="780" height="502" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png 780w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-300x193.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-768x494.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-610x393.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-600x386.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-caption-text">15 Inch Display with Full HD Resolution, 100% sRGB and Wide Viewing Angles.</p></div>
<p>During our entire review and usage, we never ever felt that the display on the ASUS FX502VM was even a bit dim. It is bright, vivid, colourful, and wide. As far as the benchmarking numbers are concerned, ASUS’s notebook managed to register an average brightness of 289 nits on our light meter, which is an edging out figure for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware on ASUS FX502VM: It is powered by a sixth generation gaming-centric Intel core i5-6300HQ mobile processor clocked at 2.3GHz. For multitasking, the processor is paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM. The laptop comes with thermal cooling technology, and thus makes use of dual cooling fans, to prevent the innards getting warm even under heavy usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_1856" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1856" class="wp-image-1856 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM.jpg" alt="Intelligent Thermal Cooling on Asus FX502VM 15 Inch Gaming Laptop" width="750" height="586" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-300x234.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-610x477.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-600x469.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1856" class="wp-caption-text">Intelligent Thermal Design &#8211; Hyper cool duo-copper cooling system keeps laptop always at comfortable temperature.</p></div>
<p>As far as storage on the laptop is concerned, it comes with a 1TB of hard disk, with an RPM of 7200. This not only ensures faster data transfers but also ensures of being a reliable data storage medium. Graphics on the laptop are handled by NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics coprocessor with a dedicated DDR5 memory of 3GB. This is the new Pascal architecture based GPU from NVidia. Hence, Asus FX502VM is a VR Ready gaming laptop and it can run all 360° games, videos and other VR content without any problems.</p>
<p>ASUS FX502 has a specially-designed chiclet gaming keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys that offer the users a large 1.6mm of travel distance. Greater the travel distance, better is the tactile feedback for keystrokes. In addition to that, the laptop also features highlighted WASD keys for user convenience. The keyboard on this laptop is undoubtedly best for gaming, but apart from that it can also be used by <a title="Top Recommended Laptops for College for Every Budget" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students for college</a> or by <a title="The Best Laptops for Computer Programmers for Coding/Programming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers for coding</a> and playing games.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The laptop sports an HD Webcam on top of the display. The camera on this laptop is not the best you get at this budget but is adequate enough to meet the basic requirements of a typical laptop’s webcam. Yes, you can make Skype calls, and can even take few selfies during your leisure. On top of that, there is nothing much to be discussed in this section.</p>
<h4>Ports</h4>
<p>ASUS FX502VM crams a number of useful and productively usable ports onto its small frame. On the left side, you&#8217;ll find a proprietary power port, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI-out, an audio jack, 1x mini Display Port, and a microSD card reader.</p>
<div id="attachment_1858" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1858" class="wp-image-1858 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Asus FX502VM 15.3-Inch Affordable Gaming Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="770" height="618" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 770w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-300x241.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-768x616.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-610x490.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-600x482.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1858" class="wp-caption-text">Extensive connectivity options on Asus FX502VM-AH51 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</p></div>
<p>The right side houses two USB 2.0 ports, which are more than good enough for most peripherals you might attach, but we wish there was another USB 3.0 so we could take advantage of the <a title="Shop External Hard Drives on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2htYAfG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fastest external hard drives available in market</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS FX502VM runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and is naturally, one of the flexible operating systems for laptops. The Windows 10, is not just good at UI but is also very productive. It has millions of apps, compatible with it and provides a deeper level of customizations to its users. Apart from all the standard lineup of Windows 10 applications and software, the ASUS FX502VM also packs in some of the ASUS’s proprietary applications of security and productivity.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with 1-year Accidental Damage Protection along with 30 days of Zero Bright Dot Guarantee, which is one of the most comprehensive coverages available for laptops. This gives you protection against accidental drops, spills and electrical surges of the laptop.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The laptop does deliver an outstanding performance in its class. Thanks to an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of hard disk drive, the laptop is surely a power-packed performer.</p>

<p>We personally feel that the laptop could have been even better if it had an SSD drive instead of HDD. During our usage, the laptop’s hard drive was reading data at 145MB/s and was writing at 135MB/s, so while nowhere near as fast as the SSD it&#8217;s clearly a decent 7200rpm model. Keeping the hard drive details aside, the laptop being a powerful gaming performer, can handle all the general daily essentials with ease. During our usage, we ran a couple of RAM consuming benchmarks, brewer with more than 15 tabs opened, music playing in the background, with a high-end game running in the background. The laptop was handling multitasking with ease and is a powerful, stable, and reliable daily performer.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, we can accolade the ASUS FX502VM for being a gaming-stationed laptop and to the fact that it is stuffed with the Nvidia’s latest GTX 1060 GPU (the main reason to get excited about this laptop). The laptop was able to handle Alien Isolation with all settings maxed out and resolution set to 1080p at an average 75fps. However, the laptop did face few hiccups at 188fps wherein the visuals dropped slightly.</p>
<p>We installed a long list of high-end games on this laptop, thanks to its massive 1TB of hard drive. We tested the laptop with our all time favourite The Witcher III, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm. The best part, the laptop was able to handle all these games with ease even with the graphics set to max. Surely, the laptop stands in its words- The best gaming laptop at the budget. So for all the gaming lovers out there who are slightly tight on budget, this is probably the best you can get.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, it is essential for the ASUS FX502VM to accommodate powerful, detailed, and loud stereo output. During our usage, we found the speakers are excellent and hold their ground. As we always mention, multimedia is one of the most vital aspects of any laptop and our contender is packed with dual HD stereo speakers with DTS tech-enabled, which does the task of providing punchy audio pretty well.</p>
<div id="attachment_1860" style="width: 866px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1860" class="size-full wp-image-1860" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review.jpg" alt="Powerful speakers and stunning display" width="856" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review.jpg 856w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-300x140.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-768x359.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-610x285.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-600x280.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1860" class="wp-caption-text">Asus FX502VM features audio by Ice Power</p></div>
<p>We tested the speakers with bass heavy punchy tracks such as no church in the west and power bass, to which the speakers on the laptop responded really well. We also tested the laptop with treble based cleaner tracks, to which it responded well again. The laptop can play all sorts of HD content including 4K with ease. After all, this packs in the latest Nvidia’s GTX 1060!</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM is juiced using a 4-cell Lithium-ion battery. After all our usage, all we can say is the laptop does provide an outstanding battery backup. That said, being a gaming-stationed laptop, we honestly, didn&#8217;t expect much from it. The laptop lasted for just over 4 hours under continuous gaming, which is still a decent backup for a laptop with this configuration and features. However, if you aren&#8217;t gaming continuously you can expect slightly better battery backup. The laptop can be charged fully from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Bottom line: <em>Are you a hardcore gamer but slightly tight on budget? Go for it blindfolded!</em></h3>
<p>With a price tag of around $1250, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASUS FX502VM 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</span> is undoubtedly our first choice, if you need a power-packed gaming machine. Moreover, there aren&#8217;t many laptops at this price point which is primarily meant for gaming. Although the laptop is not as powerful as the ASUS’s flagship ROG series of laptops or the MSI’s dominators, it still is a very efficient, reliable, and powerful all-round performer.</p>
