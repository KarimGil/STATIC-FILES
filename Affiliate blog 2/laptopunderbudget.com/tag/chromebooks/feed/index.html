										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right after HP and a bunch of other tech vendors, Acer has upped their game for their budget Chromebooks lineup and announced the Chromebook 512 and Chromebook Spin 512 at the 2019 BETT Show in <span class="xn-location">London</span>. Chromebooks are usually categorized in the &#8216;student-friendly&#8217; category. It is due to the affordability and the sturdiness that the Chrome OS based notebooks are usually built with.</p>
<p>But to get one step ahead, Acer threw in a Windows based option as well in their educational lineup. The TravelMate B114-21.</p>
<h3>Acer Chromebook Spin 512 and Acer Chromebook 512</h3>
<p>Both Chromebooks have IPS displays of 12-inches and 1366 x 912 resolution. There is however, the choice for a convertible or a non-convertible version. And as obvious with the name, the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 features a 360-degree hinge. The hinge along with the Gorilla Glass antimicrobial coating, enables four different usage modes. A tablet mode for mostly reading, notebook mode for writing and sketching, display mode for getting a clearer view of the screen, and a tent mode for presentations, editing and collaborating.</p>
<p>Another treat is the included Wacom electro-magnetic resonance (EMR) stylus. For its placement, there is dock embedded in the notebook&#8217;s body itself. Sounds pretty chic for a budget notebook, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 512 comes with an amazing 8 MP world facing HDR webcam, with auto-focus and an 88-degree wide-FOV.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5233 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Chromebook-spin-512.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="363" /></p>
<p>Both Chromebooks deliver an exceptional battery backup, ranging up to 12 hours that means day and night support for students for at least a couple of days.</p>
<p>Not only are these notebooks extremely elegant, interactive and cheap but also come with military grade robustness. These babies can withstand drops from a 4 ft height and can handle up to 60 kg (132 pounds) of exerted force. All possible due to the strengthened design and shock-absorbing bumper.</p>
<p>Another unique factor of these laptops is that they meet two major toy safety standards and have been declared safe for use for kids. This might be credited to its moisture resistant touchpad and spill-resistant keyboard. It drains any liquid out of the bottom of the chassis, providing protection to the internal components.</p>
<p>For the configurations, Acer has loaded these notebooks with an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 processor, an 8GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage, with lower configuration options also available.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5236 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/acer_chromebook-512.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="297" />Acer has priced both these notebooks for under $500 which is affordable enough for struggling students and for parents supporting them. The Acer Chromebook Spin 512 starts at $449.99 and the Acer Chromebook 512 comes in at $329.99 with their availability expected around April.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA Laptop Review – The Best Cheap Notebook?" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-1-2018-a114-32-c1ya-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer Aspire 1 Review &#8211; The Best Cheap Notebook?</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>TravelMate B114-21</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5234 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Travelmate-B114-21.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="396" />Now its quite understandable for techies to disregard Chromebooks completely no matter how flashy they might be. Considering the instability of Chrome OS with certain apps and its limitations. To cater such users, Acer also released a Windows-based, budget learning companion for students.</p>
<p>Now what makes this notebook categorized under &#8216;educational&#8217;, is its S mode feature. The laptop&#8217;s configurations go up to a 7th Gen AMD A6-9220C processor with integrated Radeon R5 graphics, 16GB of RAM for efficient multitasking and a fast 256GB SSD storage. These combined, ensure powerful support for learning activities and some decent softwares. It also features a generous selection of ports. Including 1 x USB 3.1 port, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a memory card reader, an Ethernet port and an HDMI 2.0 port. However, it misses out on the USB Type-C port.</p>
<p>What Acer has kept uniform among this educational lineup release is the military grade strength of the machine. And yes of-course the affordable price tag. Compliant with the tough U.S. Military Standard MIL-STD 810G, the TravelMate sports a rugged rubber bumper with a shock resistant body. These altogether make the laptop resilient to almost all kinds of bumps, and hits. It can also handle drops from up to 122 cms. It&#8217;s good to see that despite the cheap cost, Acer has added a 14-inch FHD display, and a 180-degree hinge to this laptop&#8217;s specs.</p>
<p>Acer claims that the TravelMate will offer up to almost 10 hours of battery backup, coming quite close to the Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Acer has priced TravelMate for around $320 and is expected to release it for purchase by mid-year 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is planning to rule over the education market with their latest Intel-based Chromebook announcements. The HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 and HP Chromebook 11 G7 EE.</p>
<p>HP plans on releasing these notebooks around April which is just the right time for tech vendors to release contrabands for school year buying cycle. Chromebooks being one of the most popular purchases for students and teachers could definitely use an upgrade like this in 2019.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The best laptops for college students of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For instance, the HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 Education Edition is loaded with the latest Intel Celeron processors N4100 or N4000 and Intel UHD Graphics 600. Alongside is its claimed 11.5-hour battery life which if true, is hard to find standup average in budget notebooks. The device is also convertible, and the 360-degree hinge can hold up support in tablet, tent, stand and laptop modes. There is also an optional HP Wacom EMR pen, dual cameras, and support for type, touch, write, capture, and draw gestures as well.</p>
<p>The device also dons a good port selection and contains USB-C ports on each side, a USB 3 Type-A port, a microSD card reader, a Headset jack, 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0. For the storage, HP has equipped this Chromebook with 64 GB eMMC storage and comes with 8GB of RAM for efficient multitasking. Additionally, it comes with a 2-year subscription to 100GB Google Drive which is a nice little bow to seal the package with.</p>
<p>With the same convertibility, port selection and the 11.6-inch screen size as its sibling x360 11 G2, the Chromebook 11 G7 EE is a more traditional take in this lineup. What the 11 G7 EE doesn&#8217;t have is its sibling&#8217;s 5MP world facing camera while both hold a 720p front-facing webcam. However, it does weight lighter &#8211; reaching about 2.9 pounds, as opposed to the 3.2 pounds of the x360 11 G2.</p>
<p>Another feature these both notebooks share is the configuration of processors and RAM, whereas the storage options in the G7 are available from 16GB to 64GB of eMMC 5.0 storage.</p>
<p>But the most impressive upgrade made by HP is shared by both Chromebooks that is the military grade robustness. Not only is it an extremely hard feature to find in budget Chromebooks like these, but it&#8217;s an addition that no one expected to get. The Chromebooks sport a minor-spill-resistant keyboard, shock-absorbing body, and Corning Gorilla Glass protection. It can also withstand a 76-centimeter drop on concrete. We think that HP paid attention to the rough routine that students usually put their laptops through and devised a solution that holds not only powerful internals but also keeps good and strong shape on the outside as well.</p>
<p>HP is yet to reveal the prices of these notebooks which will tell us a lot more about these upgrades, but until then, we can&#8217;t help but hope for it all to be good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far as CES 2019 is concerned, ASUS has been at the top of their game. They have come up with the most accessible, yet innovative solutions to cater to almost every kind of audience. Not a few days ago, ASUS introduced <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-officially-unveils-four-new-chromebooks-ces-2019/">rugged and thick notebooks for students and kids</a> &#8211; able to withstand almost any sort drop and bump that you can imagine. Now, they are back with a more premium and exquisite version of their well-worshipped Flip C302, named the Chromebook Flip C434.</p>
<p>The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 boasts a beautiful edge-to-edge screen and the signature Flip 360 hinge as its main attractions. The chassis is an all-metal aluminum body weighing just about 3.3 pounds and is only 15.7 mm thick. The rough rubber might be durable but there is just something about a silver metal finish you can&#8217;t turn away from. Plus its a good camouflage for those nasty fingerprints as well. The 2-in-1 book&#8217;s 360 ErgoLift hinge transforms the device into a traditional laptop, tablet, and tent modes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5087" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C434-1.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook Flip C434" width="599" height="498" /></p>
<p>Now, the ASUS Flip C302 was a classic success among budget users no doubt, as it provided great value for money. The Flip C434 not only does maintain the same aspect but also comes with a bunch of new upgrades. For instance now there is support for Intel’s 8th Gen Y-Series (choice between an i7-8500Y, i5-8200Y, or M3-8100Y) CPUs and the addition of a USB-A port. Apart from the affordability, there are still a lot of similarities left between the older and the latest version. Like the 8GB of RAM, upto 128GB of storage, and the microSD card slot.</p>
<p>The reason ASUS is able to offer premium looks, mid-range price, portability, and a good processor is due to the lightweight ChromeOS. This lightweight operating system has been a long companion of budget users and comes in good looking books as well. Just like the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 which stands out with its Full HD NanoEdge 14-inch touchscreen display. And that too with maintaining the very &#8216;in&#8217; trend of slim bezels which are just 5mm on this one. What&#8217;s even more impressive is that they have still to fit in a front facing camera at the top.</p>
<p>ASUS also hasn&#8217;t lost the chiclet keyboard that provides one of the most comfortable typing experiences and is also backlit. And thanks to the flexible hinge, the experience just gets better.</p>

<p>ASUS has announced this all-purpose premium ultrabook to be out in a few months. For the price &#8211; ASUS points out that instead of going overboard with either fancy specs or huge savings, they have decided to level both and offer surpassing specs within a mid-range cost and is offering its notebook with a starting price of $569.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has just announced its first Chromebook that is based on the AMD A-series processor that feature Radeon graphics. Acer is well-known for introducing very competitive Chromebooks in the past, and now Acer is adding AMD powered devices to the portfolio with the Acer Chromebook 315, which will give customers more flexibility.</p>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 315 will be powered by the entry-level 7th Gen AMD A6-9220C or A4-9120C processors, which come with Radeon graphics. The chips allow the user to have multiple tabs open and enables better multi-tasking with the help of superior performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4977 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer_Chromebook_315_06_575px.jpg" alt="AMD A-Series Processor Powered Chromebook" width="678" height="422" /></p>
<p>The Chromebook also comes with a Full HD 15.6-inch IPS display and you can choose the touchscreen option if that is what you are interested in. The company claims that the Chromebook will be able to last up to 10 hours on a single charge which is very impressive indeed, but these numbers are under particular conditions. I am guessing that with proper use, it will be able to deliver 7-8 hours which is still pretty decent.</p>
<p>It has two front-facing speakers, which should sound great. Speakers should always be front facing but this is not a feature that we see in most laptops, and I think that companies should do something about it. This is a pretty big device, so you get a full backlit keyboard too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4975 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer_Chromebook_315_02_575px.jpg" alt="AMD A-Series Processor Powered Chromebook" width="678" height="479" /></p>
<p>The device comes with two USB Type-C Gen 1 ports, but if you have older peripherals, then you need not worry as the Chromebook also has two USB 3.0 ports. You also have the headphone jack, support for WiFi 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth 4.2.</p>
<p>The Chromebook 315 will come with 8 GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It is expected to release in February, and the pricing starts at $279.99.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the Acer Chromebook 315 and whether or not this is something that you might be interested in getting for yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years after their successful foray into the Chromebook market with the Skylake-powered C302, ASUS has officially released a direct follow up to the popular Chromebook at CES 2019. Additionally, the Taiwan-based tech giant also released three more Chrome OS devices, for a total of four new releases. Each one is designed to cater to a specific range of students. In total, the entire line aims to cover every kind of student, from toddlers to teenage adolescents.</p>
<h3>Introducing ASUS&#8217; Latest Line of Chromebooks</h3>
<p>The Chromebook C204, Chromebook Flip C214, Chromebook C403 and Chromebook Tablet CT100 all feature near-identical specifications across the board and follow a similar design philosophy. However, there are a few differences in each one. For starters, the Chromebook C204 is ASUS&#8217; follow up to their popular Chromebook C202, which they released roughly two years ago for kids in primary school. Meanwhile, the Chromebook Flip C214 will serve as the successor to last year&#8217;s C213, a 2-in-1 convertible that comes with stylus support, as well as a 360° hinge and a touchscreen display, allowing for use as a traditional laptop and as a tablet at the same time.</p>
<p>As for the other two, The Chromebook C403 and the Chromebook Tablet CT100 are both totally new. The former is essentially a bigger version of the C204. Housed inside a larger chassis with <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a> but with similar, albeit slightly but older specs. The C403 is the perfect laptop for students in middle school and high school who mostly prefer the larger real estate for homework and personal use. The latter is ASUS&#8217; first Chrome OS tablet. It comes with a 9.7&#8243; display and stylus support to draw and take notes. The CT100 <a title="The Best Tablets For Kids – Our Most Recommended Kids Tablets That Come With Comprehensive Parental Controls" href="https://tabletunderbudget.com/best-tablets-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tablet is designed specifically for kids</a> who are just starting out to learn and understand computers, but comes with the same Chrome OS found in the chromebooks.</p>
<h3>Military-grade Build Quality</h3>
<p>ASUS prides themselves on their use of military-grade &#8220;ruggedized&#8221; designs for all four of their latest Chrome OS devices, using reinforced and rubberized edges to help protect the devices from the occasional bumps and falls. Also, each Chromebook come equipped with water-resistant and tamper-resistant keyboards for added durability. Although the CT100 tablet doesn&#8217;t have a keyboard, it features the same &#8220;ruggedized&#8221; design that makes it both accessible and durable enough to withstand everyday use by a toddler.</p>
<h3>Display, Size, and Weight</h3>
<p>Although all of the Chromebook devices follow the same design philosophy, each one comes in a different display size, total size, and of course, weight.</p>
<p>The largest of the four is the C403. It comes with a 14-inch HD LED display with anti-glare coating, measuring at 13.5&#8243; x 9.2&#8243; x 0.8&#8243; and weighing at 3.7 pounds. It&#8217;s considerably larger than the smaller C204, which only weighs 2.6 pounds, measuring at 11.5&#8243; x 7.8&#8243; x 0.8&#8243; and is equipped with a smaller 11.6-inch LED display with anti-glare coating. However, both models come with a 180° hinge that makes it easier for users to show their work to other people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 11-inch Laptops</a></strong></p>
<p>As for the Chromebook Flip C214, it comes with an 11.6-inch HD touch display. It can serve as either as a tablet or as a laptop, depending on its user&#8217;s needs, thanks to its durable 360° hinge. It clocks in at 2.6 pounds, which is the same weight as the C204.</p>
<p>Finally, the CT100 is a 9.7-inch tablet that weighs only 1.3 pounds and is designed specifically for kids.</p>
<h3>Specs and Battery Life</h3>
<p>Both the 2-in-1 Chromebook Flip C214 and the smaller Chromebook C204 are powered by the latest Intel Gemini Lake processors. Meanwhile, the larger C403 comes equipped with a slightly older Apollo Lake processor. All three can support up to 8GB of LDDR4 memory and up to 32GB of eMMc storage. However, only the C214 can support up to 64GB eMMc storage. The port selection on both the C204 and the C403 include 2 x USB Type-C 3.1 ports, 2 x USB Type-A 3.0 ports, a MicroSD card reader, an audio combo jack, as well as Bluetooth 4.2 support. The C214 comes with roughly the same port selection, but only just 1 x USB Type-A 3.0 port.</p>
<p>As for the battery, ASUS has equipped their latest line of products with 45 WHr batteries, although the C204 comes with a little bit more juice at 50WHr.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>ASUS have yet to announce pricing for all regions for their latest line of Chrome OS devices. However, according to ASUS, retailers should have the devices in stock sometime later this year, with the C403 and the C214 possibly already available in Spring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when Samsung unveiled their Chromebook Plus V2 in June earlier this year? While the device was applauded for its affordability, it just couldn&#8217;t live up to the original Chromebook Plus. Well at least according to some users. Maybe Samsung paralleled with this idea and decided to up their Chromebook Plus V2 game up a bit. Turns out that Samsung, in collaboration with Google, has upgraded this Chromebook model to support 4G LTE.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The Chromebook Plus V2 stepped into the shelves with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, Intel Celeron 3965Y processor chip &#8211; faster than the <a title="Samsung Chromebook Plus Review – Play Store finally comes to Chromebooks" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/samsung-chromebook-plus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Plus</a>, a  12.2-inch, 1080p display, 4GB RAM, 32GB of solid-state storage, and a 39Wh battery. So you can see that Chromebook Plus V2 was intended to be the upgraded version of the Chromebook Plus. More so, this device is capable enough to be called premium.</span></p>
<p>Samsung deciding to upgrade their already upgraded version seems like they wanted an edge over the <a title="Google Pixel Slate is finally here and here’s our take on the tablet!" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/google-pixel-slate-features-specs-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Pixel Slate</a>. Which according to tech reviewers is the biggest contender of the Chromebook Plus V2 this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_4323" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-image-4323 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-V2-with-LTE.jpg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE" width="561" height="369" /><p id="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-caption-text">Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE</p></div>
<p>Josh Newman, general manager of Mobile PC Segments, Intel Client Computing Group, said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Samsung’s new Chromebook Plus V2 (LTE) device meets this expectation with style by fusing Samsung design ingenuity and Google’s beloved OS with Intel processors and Intel LTE connectivity.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>What does the 4G LTE do?</h3>
<p>For all you folks who don&#8217;t really grasp the idea of 4G LTE, let me break it down for you. It allows you to stay connected to the internet even if you don&#8217;t have a Wi-Fi connection. The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE or the Chromebook Plus V2 on-the-go is a dream for remote workers and travelers.</p>
<p>A sharp HD display with 300 nits max brightness, an energy-efficient processor, 360-degree hinge, and a stylus with an added 4G LTE feature sound too good to be true. It&#8217;s not all fun and games though. The connectivity feature addition adds a $100 cost to the overall price too. Not quite affordable but wouldn&#8217;t be called too steep either.</p>
<p>The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE be available for $599 when it launches on November 2 at Verizon and Best Buy. Samsung hasn&#8217;t yet revealed which networks this device will supporting but we have good hopes.</p>
<p>Given that the Google Pixel comes with the same price as this 2-in-1 convertible notebook but minus the 4G LTE feature, might not work in Pixel&#8217;s favor. Or maybe the Google Pixel Slate&#8217;s innovative design and sleeker body be enough for Chrome OS lovers to choose it over LTE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s about time that Google decided to up their tablet game with their Chrome OS. The Pixel Slate was unveiled on October 9th and it seems to shatter all the stereotypes that were widely accepted about Google&#8217;s slight incompetency in crafting premium tablets.</p>
<p>Although Google has decided to abandon Android tablets altogether, the Pixel Slate&#8217;s touch has a very Android-like feel to it. The UI however, has a quite Pixel-y sense to it. Even though the screen is 12.3-inches which is pretty wide for a phone like interface with icons spread across the screen. The device weighs a total of 1.6 pounds and quite frankly, feels even lighter. Google was quite particular in ensuring the center balance of the device is intact for improved accessibility when the device is held up like a tablet.</p>
<p>The convertibility aspects are quite spectacular too. The cover of the tablet smoothly glides on the back surface of the device to be adjusted in 3 different positions. It latches on to the embedded magnets inside the device which takes out the annoying hinges and screws out of the picture. The Pixel Slate auto shifts from tablet mode to PC mode. Though convenient- but at times the lack of manual switching might feel like a restriction. The Slate detects the presence of a mouse or trackpad and transforms into cursor mode for more precision during usage and of course, to give the users a PC like feel. The backlit keyboard is an appreciable addition to the Google tablets and was long overdue as well. On top of backlighting, the keys are in circular shape which although is a nice innovation but might take some time getting used to.</p>
<h3>Have a look at more detailed specifications:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions: 7.0mm x 290.85mm x 202.04mm</li>
<li>Weight: 1.6 lbs (without keyboard)</li>
<li>Color: Midnight Blue</li>
<li>Display: 12.3” 3000 x 2000 (293 ppi) LCD “Molecular Display” (400 nits) with Pixelbook Pen support</li>
<li>Processor options: 8th Gen Intel Core m3, i5, i7 or Intel Celeron</li>
<li>RAM options: 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB</li>
<li>Storage options: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB SSD</li>
<li>Battery: 48 WHr, up to 10 hours (supports fast charging)</li>
<li>Ports: two USB-C, keyboard connector</li>
<li>Wireless: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, no LTE option</li>
<li>Audio: Dual front-facing speakers, two mics</li>
<li>Front camera: 8MP,  ƒ/1.9 aperture, 1.4um pixel size, 1080p video at 30 fps</li>
<li>Rear Camera: 8MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture, 1.12um pixel size, Auto Focus, 1080p video at 30 fps</li>
<li>Security: “Pixel Imprint” fingerprint sensor on power button, Titan C security chip</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeap, we know what you are thinking. Where&#8217;s the headphone jack? Turns out, Google has decided to skip the 3.5mm headphone jack altogether. Google says that the decision was based on the fact that most advanced users are transitioning towards Bluetooth accessories. There is, however, a headphone jack dongle with the device but seems kind of silly using it with a sleek, convertible laptop/tablet. Loses its essence don&#8217;t you think? On the bright side, there are two USB-C ports. Largely intended for fast charging and 4K video output. There is also a custom keyboard connector and two microphones along with a power button with an embedded fingerprint scanner. A classy move indeed.</p>
<p>The display of the device is quite extraordinary. The Slate has a pixel density of 293 ppi surrounded by thin bezels which only compliments the resolution of 2000 x 3000 pixels. Google has chosen to brand the screen technology of Pixel Slate by giving it the name “Molecular Display.” The screen technology uses low-temperature polycrystalline silicon or LTPS which is known for its effects on optimal battery life. Google claims that their Slate cum PC can hold up to 10 hours of juice in a single run.</p>
<h3>Pricing sheet</h3>
<p>The specs and display of the Pixel slate scream convertible more than any other tablet that Google has released. If paired with the right accessories, this Slate has every capability to be used as a full-fledged PC.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4276" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Google-Pixel-Slate-revealed.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Slate revealed" width="690" height="345" /></p>
<p>For the keyboard, there are three choices to opt from.  Any Bluetooth keyboard, a $149 Brydge Bluetooth keyboard specifically designed for the Pixel Slate with an included trackpad, much like the ones Brydge sells for the iPad and Surface Pro. Last but the best &#8211; Google’s very own first-party accessory, the $199 Pixel Slate Keyboard.</p>
<p>The Pixel Slate is priced like PCs too. The tablet is available in multiple variants, starting from $600 with an Intel Celeron processor to a $1600 model with an Intel Core i7 processor.</p>
<h4>Here is the full price sheet:</h4>
<ul>
<li id="0ITYN6">$599 (4GB RAM, 32GB SSD, Intel® Celeron processor)</li>
<li id="0KRLKK">$699 (8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, Intel® Celeron processor)</li>
<li id="85pbgP">$799 (8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, 8th Gen Intel® Core m3 processor)</li>
<li id="taWdZr">$999 (8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 8th Gen Intel® Core i5 processor)</li>
<li id="AbBSCW">$1599 (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 8th Gen Intel® Core i7 processor)</li>
<li id="i1hwn6">Pixel Slate Keyboard &#8211; $199</li>
<li id="rUGXEk">Brydge Bluetooth Keyboard &#8211; $159</li>
<li id="zUJtJ8">Pixelbook Pen &#8211; $99</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final word</h3>
<p>The Pixel Slate is a massive jump for Google from their failed Nexus tablets to Chrome-based PC convertibles. And I mean it in a good way.</p>
<p>Due to its slim design, the device is not lap friendly when connected with a keyboard but that seems like one of the few minor inconveniences of the device.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that Google is in line and ready to compete with the strongest tablet contenders in the market &#8211; the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro. It will be interesting to see how this pans out.</p>

<p>With Google&#8217;s Pixel phone leaks and rumors taking over the news feed like a storm, the Chromebook updates are certainly not left behind.</p>
<p>Seems like the much awaited &#8216;Nocturne&#8217; &#8211; a tablet 2 in 1 convertible with a detachable keyboard and two Intel processor generations, is going to be unveiled as the <em><strong>Pixel Slate</strong></em>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/RDRv3/status/1045319666141290497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1045319666141290497&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2018%2F09%2F27%2Fgoogle-pixel-slate-nocturne%2F">David Ruddock</a>, the infamous tech-journalist, the news comes from a reliable source.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google Pixel Slate is the name of Google&#8217;s first Chrome OS tablet. This name has been offered up so many times as a possibility I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s worthy of a story, but this is from a source I trust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although there is no official word regarding the latest hybrid Chromebook being named Pixel Slate, there are certainly enough rumors to support the evidence. For instance, the addition of a fingerprint sensor on top of the the tablet screen &#8211; a feature that has long been missing from the Chrome OS. Some leaked images have also resurfaced suggesting that this hybrid &#8216;Slate&#8217; will include a third-party keyboard made by Brydge. These features if true, fit the Pixel description perfectly.</p>
<p>Being one of Google&#8217;s novelty tablets featuring the Chrome OS, Pixel Slate is also rumored to dual boot Windows 10. This might be the trump card for Pixel Slate on this year&#8217;s Made by Google event as currently the only device to support this feature is the Pixelbook. That being said, the Pixel Slate is not necessarily to be launched with Windows 10 support. All we can say at this point is that the Windows 10 addition might be in Google&#8217;s roadmap for this device.</p>
<p>The rumors do seem to fit the puzzle as with these specs, the Nocturne might as well be the sibling of Google&#8217;s other Pixel products. But there so much we can speculate, we will leave the rest to be confirmed on October 9th, that is the launch of Google&#8217;s Pixel 3 phone . Despite the launch of Pixelbook being not less than a year ago, the Chromebook fans are definitely excited to see what Made by Google event might have in store for them this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has been one of the initial companies to partner with the Google’s Chrome OS project. The laptop manufacturing company is globally renowned to provide value for money laptops in various categories. Likewise, the Chromebook R11 is a unique notebook in the segment of Chrome OS-powered laptops. Unlike, most of the other Chromebooks, the R11 is a convertible laptop, which can be used in various modes thanks to its 360-degree hinges. The versatile and 2-in-1 laptops are becoming increasingly popular among the people these days.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Acer Chromebook R11 is also a convertible laptop stuffed with some interesting set of hardware and specifications, which makes it one of the powerful <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook under $300</a>. It has won various accolades worldwide from common users to the tech community.</p>
<p>The R11 is promised to provide a comfortable user experience, competent performance with its long lasting battery life. But is the Google’s browser-stationed Chrome OS designed to be used with a touchscreen display? Is it powerful enough to handle our everyday essentials? Without further delay, let’s drill down to know how this laptop fares under various use-cases and circumstances.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, here&#8217;s a quick overview of its hardware specifications &#8211;</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are inevitably difficult to be made. Reason? They have to stay inexpensive yet provide good performance and the most difficult part, it has to compete with the market that’s now full of Chromebooks available for dirt cheap prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3310" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11" width="469" height="332" /></p>
<p>The R11 is launched with a base price of under $300 and therefore, it has to deliver a lot for the asking price. As far as the design and built factor are concerned, the R11 comes with an 11.6-inch screen size which is decked out in a very clean and tidy chassis. The laptop comes with a diamond patterned finish from the outside which gives an additional level of grip, making it easy to hold and carry. Although the company (Acer) claims that the outer lid of the laptop is made up of aluminum, we felt that it was feeble and the design wasn’t very solidly built.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 - Lid" width="372" height="260" /></p>
<p>Having that said, the laptop offers great ergonomics, which you hardly get at this price point. The device comes with compact measurements at 11.6 x 8.03 x 0.76 inches which fit well in bags. Moreover, it weighs just about 2.7 pounds, which is yet another add-on.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a 360-degrees hinge, which is the core of its convertible aspect. The laptop flips well and can be used in four different modes.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen HD WideScreen LED-backlit display with a resolution of 1366&#215;768 pixels. The screen comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which now is a standard and common thing we see in most of the laptops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible - Display" width="700" height="507" /></p>
<p>The laptop offers good color gamut and also manages to provide decent viewing angles. However, what made us disappointed is that the laptop’s display is not adequately bright which makes the outdoor usage a bit cumbersome. Even at the brightness set to maximum, the display didn’t felt very bright, which affects the crispness and contrasts of the regular usage. During our benchmarking, the laptop managed to score a mere 225 nits of brightness, which is subpar considering its contenders which manage to score over 300 nits.</p>
<p>When we put the laptop display’s color reproduction to test, we got a decent 74% of sRGB spectrum, which is very well on top of other Chromebooks priced similarly. We also used the device to watch some high-quality movies and other content, to which the display responded well and gave us a decent experience minus the brightness.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C1LK) is stuffed with decent specifications for the asking price. The device is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor paired with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM. The processor, however, can be throttled up to 2.08GHz through the Intel’s Burst technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The display as mentioned above is an 11.6-inch HD display, which comes with a 10-point multi-touch support. Storage segment on the device is backed by a 32GB of solid-state drive internal storage which is very less and that&#8217;s the problem with every Chromebook these days. Thankfully, like most others, the Acer Chromebook R11 also comes with an SD card slot to add more storage.<br />

<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script></p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with one USB 3.0 port for faster, better, and reliable data transfers and comes with another USB 2.0 port to add on an additional peripheral. The R11 also houses one HDMI Port, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a charging port.</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-image-3315 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible Laptop" width="650" height="398" /><p id="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Chromebook R 11 offers USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card Slot and 3.5mm Audio Jack</strong></em></p></div>
<p>For the connectivity, the Acer Chromebook R11 is packed with the latest MIMO 802.11ac wireless technology to support smooth, reliable, and interruption free internet browsing experience. It comes with Dual-Band support to house both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with ease.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with a 720p HD front-facing webcam. The camera like most of the other laptops doesn’t offer any fancy stuff here. The camera takes images with noise and doesn’t produce accurate colors. However, it will suffice your occasional Skype or Hangout calls. The images captured looks a bit muffled. However, the image adjusts quickly on the frame.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The R11 doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned, on what OS does the device runs on. It runs on the latest Chrome OS, which is powered by Google. Google also promised, regular updates, to keep the device safe and lag-free. Although there isn’t much to say about the OS, we want our viewers to know that almost all the tasks in the Chromebooks are confined in a web UI, i.e in the browser.</p>
<p>It might be exciting to know that, Google also promised that the Chromebooks, will soon be able to run Android applications. However, as of now, the R11 doesn’t run android applications. We expect Google to roll the compatibility in an iterative process in the near future.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are not as powerful as the other Windows OS based counterparts. However, the devices manage to impress with their sturdy performance. Although the devices come with a moderately powerful set of hardware, it’s the light-weight software of the Chrome OS, which makes the things smooth and easy.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the Acer Chromebook R11 comes with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor and a 4GB of RAM. This set of hardware is powerful enough to house most of our daily essentials. To test this, we used the device extensively and here is what we’ve felt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 - Performance" width="480" height="298" /></p>
<p>The R11 handled almost all the basic tasks with ease. Browsing the internet, watching videos, multimedia usage, and editing documents were smooth and lag free. The device takes considerably negligible boot up time and loads very quickly. The device tends to get slightly heated when throttled to its full potential. However, the heat remains in limit and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to use. Being a Chromebook, users need to keep their expectations in check. That said, a Chromebook is far from <a title="Top 8 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a>, and other heavy graphic-demanding applications.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the R11 is neat and sturdy and feels solid to type on. The trackpad is rightly placed and comes with adequate space for the palm rest while using.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Chromebook we expect the device to handle Chrome browser with ease. Since almost all the tasks in the device are performed in a web interface, we rapidly switched between a dozen tabs in Chrome, to which the device responded really well. We also managed to run a couple of benchmarks to get a lucid view of the performance of the device, and here is what we’ve managed to achieve with the R11. It scored an 8,200 in Octane and close to 5000 on Mozilla Kraken. These benchmarks correspond to the ability to run scripts in the browser and overall performance.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 although can be a decent multimedia companion, but the device isn’t any groundbreaking in the segment. Discredits to its dull display and muffled speaker output, you will have to keep your expectations in check.</p>
<p>The device can play almost all formats of video content with ease and we didn’t face any lag or frame drops. The speakers are considerably loud but however, the sound tends to get crackled at higher volumes.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>During our time with the device, the Chromebook R11 lasted slightly over 10 hours on a single charge. The device is backed by a 3220mAh battery and the battery backup of the Chromebook is what makes it a very worthy contender in the segment. The device gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in about 2 hours, and stays juiced up to handle all your essentials.</p>
<p>All that said, Battery backup is undeniably a very strong aspect of the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Touchscreen Laptop" width="450" height="344" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg 450w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-300x229.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Acer Chromebook R11 with impeccable battery life and convertible option makes it a very good buy for the asking price. The touchscreen option, and very neatly recessed keyboard and trackpad make it an easy to use it. However, like with every laptop, it certainly has its own hits and misses. The laptop’s display is dull and the audio output is pretty mediocre.</p>
<p>However, if one is ready to trade off those two aspects with the long-lasting battery backup and stable performance, the Acer Chromebook R11 is certainly a value for money investment. It is also worth considering that most of the other contenders in the price range fall behind the R11 when it comes to performance and versatility that it offers.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2475" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Tablet Mode and Stylus" width="590" height="452">The stylus also facilities easier drawing and screenshot capture for future reference. The metal top allows the owner to use it in adverse conditions without wear and tear issues. The Samsung Chromebook Plus also has a USB Port and stylus parking space. The side part of the laptop is used wisely to house the volume and power button. One can easily reach those buttons on side while using&nbsp;this laptop and control the volume.</p>
<p>With the dimensions being 11.04 x 8.72 x 0.55 inches, this laptop is comparably on the lighter side when it comes to weight. While all the other laptops are 3.2 lbs or 3 lbs, this amazing laptop is just 2.4lbs heavy. The lightweight model and long battery life allows people to take it along into the woods and enjoy their outings like never before.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Display of Samsung Chromebook Plus is something that puts it ahead of all the popular modern day laptops. The facility to move the screen and adjust according to your viewing angle is like a gift to mankind. Now people can enjoy the best of movies by moving into their beds or by reclining on a comfortable couch. The moving screen also facilitates conversion of the laptop into a tablet. The tablet view is very much idle for surfing and reading; one can finally capture screenshots and also bookmark quotes only to revisit them later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2476" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Display-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus - Display" width="600" height="400">The LED-Lit screen with a resolution of 2400X1600 pixels is not so good for a laptop but highly impressive from a tablet’s point of view.

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop has been in news for a long time now, the quality display and the impressive design had people in awe but what about the technical specifications? Are they equally worthy of praises?</p>
<p>This laptop comes with an ARM-based OPI processor, well a lot of you might be thinking, it does not have an <a title="Find best Intel processor laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel processor</a>, must not be good, then let me tell you, ARM based processors work best with the Android Applications. Since Samsung Chromebook is based on Chrome OS and not Windows, ARM-based OPI Processors are the best. These processors are going to facilitate a greater run for applications and also provide eloquent streaming of high-quality videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>While the processor is really good with HD videos, it seems to skip a few frames when processing a 4K video. The Pro version is supposed to have covered such petty issues.</p>
<p>The 4GB of RAM is good enough to power a processor with speed of 2 GHz, one can easily brag about their tablet cum laptop possessing such high processing power.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2477" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Touch-Laptop-Stand-Mode-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop Stand Mode" width="600" height="439">32GB of Flash Storage is something that is going to upset a lot of people and affect their final decision. The storage provided is extremely low in comparison to what other laptops come with but then one can consider 32GB of Flash Storage good enough for a tablet. Also, it is facilitated with the microSD card slot so there&#8217;s always an option to expand the memory.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible has a processor count of 6, which makes it easier for people to launch a good number of apps simultaneously. Designed to support multitasking this chromebook&nbsp;will see people accomplishing a lot of work at the same time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h4>Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>With the fastest Bluetooth 4.0 this laptop is designed to send and receive signals at a better speed. 802.11 Wi-Fi is good enough to facilitate easier connection establishment and faster web browsing.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this laptop can process some of the toughest files with great ease. The 4GB of RAM, processor with a speed of 2GHz are designed to process all kind of requests and file quite efficiently. Thanks to the efficient set of hardware for a lightweight OS like Chrome, the Samsung Chromebook Plus provides impeccable performance without much stutter or lag.</p>
<div id="attachment_2478" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Touch-Laptop-Size-1.jpeg" alt="Think Light and Convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus" width="428" height="445"><p id="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>0.51&#8243; Thickness &nbsp;| &nbsp;2.38lbs weight</strong></p></div>
<p>The processor provided with the laptop can house all the sufficient power needed to run most of the applications you throw at it. Moreover, thanks to the browser-based interface of the laptop, multitasking on the laptop is pretty smooth and does the tasks efficiently. In addition to all this said, this convertible laptop remains very quiet even under heavy usage, which is very consoling considering the price, form-factor, and performance of this laptop. The laptop sometimes tend to get slightly warmed up under heavy usage, but we’d like to inform you guys that its just near to negligible. All in all, the Samsung Chromebook Plus offers good overall performance at the budget.</p>
<h4>Touchscreen &amp; Stylus</h4>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2479 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Drawing-with-Samsung-Pen-1.jpeg" alt="Drawing with Samsung Pen" width="650" height="381">The input features provided with this laptop are exceptional, one can use the touchscreen to make the drawings more detailed and videos more intricate. The stylus facilitates easier selection, bookmarking and also screen capturing. The stylus on Samsung phones are already impressive and we are glad that&nbsp;they included the same stylus with same functionalities on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus as well. The touchscreen display on this chromebook is also&nbsp;pressure sensitive so this chromebook can really do wonders with&nbsp;photo editing and graphics designing.</p>

<h3>Operating System</h3>
<p>This laptop makes an exception with the operating system. Not functioning on Windows just like the other contemporaries, this laptop runs on Chrome Operating System, which makes it easier for people to run all the applications they have on their phones on this gadget as well. Chrome OS is going to lead the innovation in this sector, enterprises from all faces of life are now going to concentrate on innovation and come up with really smart and newer versions of operating system.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With the dedicated integrated graphic card, 4GB of RAM and 2 GHz processor speed, users can run all the games they play on their mobile devices. The Chrome OS supports Google Play Stores and all the applications listed on this store. The experience is going to be amazing for everyone who loves games from Google Play Store. One can make the wise use of 4GB of RAM and experience the output.</p>
<p>However, we’d like to add a point here, although the laptop is powerful enough to handle light-weighted games, a Chromebook isn&#8217;t meant for real-time gaming. That said, you could always play internet based flash games or normal arcade games available on Play Store with ease, but games like Asphalt 4 still&nbsp;struggles to run smoothly on this laptop. We think Google still needs to refine Chrome OS a bit for more smoother gaming on Chromebooks.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The audio and video impresses the masses because it supports the varied file formats of audio and video. For its audio performance, we tried playing some high-quality encoded audio Flacs and the laptop to our surprise was handling them with ease. The sound quality was good and decent and was loud enough to cover an entire small room. For the video quality, we tried playing some HD, Full HD, and 4K video content, which also responded really well. The colours reproduced on the screen were accurate and were true to life. All in all, the Samsung&nbsp;Chromebook Plus is also a very good multimedia-stationed convertible device.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life of Samsung Chromebook Plus is quite exceptional, only a handful of laptops provide above 10 hours of&nbsp;battery backup while none of the tablets do. This Laptop cum tablet can stay juiced up to 11 continuous hours so that you never have to worry about carrying your charger again.&nbsp;Apart from that, this chromebook &nbsp;gets fully charged in slightly over 2 hours, which is again a strong point of this laptop. The beauty of Chrome OS based laptops is that, the OS used here is pretty light weight and doesn&#8217;t consume much of the hardware or resources to get the work done, this way, the battery life remains exceptional under everyday usage.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2480" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Laptop-Bottom-Line-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop Review" width="708" height="472">Samsung Chromebook Plus convertible laptop is the undisputed winner when it comes to providing people with an incomparable user experience. The quality audio, video, processing power, long battery life and light weight body are just other reasons why you should bet your money on this laptop. The only thing disappointing about this laptop is the storage space. The 32GB of Flash storage will restrict people from storing their favourite movies and enjoy them when either travelling or stuck at workplace with nothing to do.</p>
