										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only a week left before the &#8216;Made by Google&#8217; event which is the grand launch of Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones. Nonetheless, techies are also psyched about the unveiling of Pixel Slate and more so because it is rumoured to dual boot Windows 10.</p>
<h3>But why do we think so?</h3>
<p>It was revealed in the Chromium documentation that surfaced sometime in July, a <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/1155570">commit</a> that mentions &#8216;<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/upcoming-chromebook-nocturne-named-pixel-slate/">Nocturne</a>&#8216; a.k.a Pixel Slate along with Windows 10.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Windows 10 will BSOD early during boot with the way things are currently laid out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This might just mean that Windows 10 might appear in a future <a title="Chromebook Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/chromebooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook</a> model. But with the upcoming Google event and the rumors about Pixel Slate, it only makes so much sense that these two might come in a package.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/bmpblk/+/1236014">Chromium code commit</a> suggests renaming &#8216;alt-os&#8217; to &#8216;dual boot&#8217;. This seems like good enough evidence to raise speculations about a dual boot OS related to this project.</p>
<blockquote><p>Add select_os, rename &#8216;alt os&#8217; to &#8216;dual boot&#8217;.</p>
<p>Add campfire specific image resources</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Alt-OS&#8217; a.k.a &#8216;Project Campfire&#8217; believed as Google&#8217;s project for incorporating dual-booting option and Chrome OS in a single device.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, another <a href="https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/27605/1..3//COMMIT_MSG">commit</a> resurfaced stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve got an OS that can&#8217;t boot with the way things are currently laid out</p></blockquote>
<p>With these slight hints, I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that Google has been planning this for a while and what better device to inaugurate this feature in than their very own hybrid, Pixel Slate.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; letter-spacing: -1px;">Final Verdict for Pixel Slate</span></p>
<p>Uptil now, only the Pixel Book has officially been declared to have support for both Google OS and Windows 10. With the Pixel Slate having rumored to have the same capabilities, might not necessarily be a mean a good thing. Since Windows 10 already has a vast user base, there is a huge possibility that the Chrome OS might fail in this tablet. Which would be a shame considering that a hybrid convertible tablet, having the robustness to support  Chrome OS, Linux, Android and Windows 10 singularly is a bold yet an impressive move by Google.</p>
<p>But since Google has extended their Chrome OS to support Linux and Android apps, we can see  Chrome OS is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile OS.</p>

<p>With Google&#8217;s Pixel phone leaks and rumors taking over the news feed like a storm, the Chromebook updates are certainly not left behind.</p>
<p>Seems like the much awaited &#8216;Nocturne&#8217; &#8211; a tablet 2 in 1 convertible with a detachable keyboard and two Intel processor generations, is going to be unveiled as the <em><strong>Pixel Slate</strong></em>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/RDRv3/status/1045319666141290497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1045319666141290497&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2018%2F09%2F27%2Fgoogle-pixel-slate-nocturne%2F">David Ruddock</a>, the infamous tech-journalist, the news comes from a reliable source.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google Pixel Slate is the name of Google&#8217;s first Chrome OS tablet. This name has been offered up so many times as a possibility I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s worthy of a story, but this is from a source I trust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although there is no official word regarding the latest hybrid Chromebook being named Pixel Slate, there are certainly enough rumors to support the evidence. For instance, the addition of a fingerprint sensor on top of the the tablet screen &#8211; a feature that has long been missing from the Chrome OS. Some leaked images have also resurfaced suggesting that this hybrid &#8216;Slate&#8217; will include a third-party keyboard made by Brydge. These features if true, fit the Pixel description perfectly.</p>
<p>Being one of Google&#8217;s novelty tablets featuring the Chrome OS, Pixel Slate is also rumored to dual boot Windows 10. This might be the trump card for Pixel Slate on this year&#8217;s Made by Google event as currently the only device to support this feature is the Pixelbook. That being said, the Pixel Slate is not necessarily to be launched with Windows 10 support. All we can say at this point is that the Windows 10 addition might be in Google&#8217;s roadmap for this device.</p>
<p>The rumors do seem to fit the puzzle as with these specs, the Nocturne might as well be the sibling of Google&#8217;s other Pixel products. But there so much we can speculate, we will leave the rest to be confirmed on October 9th, that is the launch of Google&#8217;s Pixel 3 phone . Despite the launch of Pixelbook being not less than a year ago, the Chromebook fans are definitely excited to see what Made by Google event might have in store for them this year.</p>
