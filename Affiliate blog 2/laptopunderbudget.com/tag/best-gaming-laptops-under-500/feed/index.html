										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We generally research on laptops at Laptop Under Budget to find the best laptops from a lot and suggest to our audience, but this time we did something different. We tried to find out what is the most common budget among the people when they are looking for a new laptop. To do so, we checked thousands of expert advice requests that we receive every month through this <a title="Ask Laptop Under Budget Experts" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/expert-advise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Expert Advice page</a> on our website. To our surprise, we found that $500 is the most common budget among the people and for that price people wanted the laptops that can perform all the everyday tasks and also some light gaming. Some of them were also concerned about a good display while some of them wanted a lightweight laptop with full day battery life and a good keyboard, all under 500 dollars.<br />
<span id="more-648"></span></p>
<p>Finding such laptops is a challenging task because sub-$500 laptops are still considered to be the budget category laptops (i.e., low-performance laptops), and there are tons of laptops in the market to easily puzzle the person.</p>
<p>We took this into account and worked accordingly, we tested a lot of laptops from different manufacturers in 500 dollars price range and finally here&#8217;s the outcome of it — <strong>A list of best laptops under $500 of 2020</strong>. We picked all the best all-purpose laptops in $500 price range which we think are the best laptops to suit the vast array of requirements of people.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s have a look at all the best budget all-purpose laptops one by one.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#bdbdbd;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#d7d7d7;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><strong>NOTE &#8211;</strong> Most laptops in this guide are ranging in between $400 to $500. If you are looking for even cheaper laptops, then you can check out our <a title="All Budget Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/budget-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget laptop buying guides</a> where you will find <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops priced under $400</a> and lesser price ranges than that.</div></div>

<p>The laptop is powered by the newest 10th Gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor coupled with 8GB of RAM. It comes with a <strong>256GB SSD</strong> which helps to quickly load the apps and transfer the files. The screen on the laptop is the only small drawback to the laptop, as it doesn&#8217;t get bright enough to use in direct sunlight, but its viewing angles are excellent and with its dual Dolby backed speakers it&#8217;s great for watching movies or tv shows with friends or family.</p>
<p>In terms of the processing power, its ability to switch between the apps, and transition effects the laptop does reasonably well and has thus paved the way for itself on our list. The laptop comes preloaded with Windows 10 operating system, and also packs in a bunch of useful business applications and licenses for free.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA is a revamped version of the previous VivoBook edition of laptops launched by the company. This time ASUS has been in trend and made its laptops much more elegant, sleek, and stylish. The laptops are also lighter and are marginally thinner than its predecessors and weigh just about 3.7 pounds and come with measurements of 14.2 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches.</p>
<div id="attachment_3097" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-image-3097 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop - Design" width="650" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thinner &amp; Lighter (Just 0.8-inch thick and weighs 3.7 pounds)</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a brushed metal, shiny chassis, in a glittering grey color. The laptop is thicker at the hinge-edge and gradually gets narrower. The design aspects of the VivoBook, we feel, are largely drawn from the likes of the <a title="Check Current Price of MacBook Air on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2hKvugK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple’s MacBook Air</a> externally. The placement of ports, trackpad, keyboard, and other vitals are very similar to the previous generation of VivoBooks, and all in all, the laptop feels quite easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3098 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop Review" width="650" height="386" /></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of this laptop is that it comes with an ultra-narrow 0.3-inch ASUS’ proprietary NanoEdge bezel, which gives an amazing 80% of screen-to-body ratio. The bezels on the laptop are fairly negligible and are probably one of the rarest laptops in the market currently to offer such slim bezel display in a laptop at such low price.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, ASUS VivoBook F510UA makes it feels like you have a full-size 15.6” FHD WideView display embedded into a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a>, which not only makes it compact and sleek to use, but also offers wider, bigger, and much better display. On a final note on the design and build quality, the laptop comes with a uniform solid build quality and certainly is beautiful enough to attract the masses.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LED display which is vibrant. As far as the resolution of the display is concerned, it comes with a Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. As mentioned earlier, the laptop’s WideView makes it look even better, and thanks to its larger display, the viewing angles on this machine are perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_3099" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-image-3099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop - Display Review" width="800" height="445" /><p id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also comes with the ASUS’ proprietary Splendid visual optimization technology, which automatically provides the optimized visuals to the user for almost any kind of content being played. The laptop comes with custom features as well as pre-installed display modes such as Normal, Vivid, Eye-Care, and Manual, which can be accessed and enabled based on the user’s choice. The videos on the screen also turn out to be a visual treat all thanks to the ASUS Tru2Life Video technology which enhances the movie watching experience on this laptop. The display on this device comes with an intelligent set of sensors which optimises the essential visual parameters such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and hue in every pixel to produce vivid and lively imagery.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA laptop offers a robust set of innards and is undeniably a powerful device on the paper. Let’s have a quick glance at what does the laptop offers. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the latest and the most advanced, 8th Generation of Intel Core i5-8250U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 1.6GHz which can, however, rattle up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Laptops with Intel Core i5 8th Gen Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Multitasking and the applications on the device are handled by an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage department on the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of HDD, which is although ample amount of storage, still lags behind SSD when it comes to data transfer speeds and efficiency. We hoped that the laptop comes with an SSD storage, this could have been a deadly combination for a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $500</a>. The laptop comes with an integrated graphics coprocessor and doesn’t come with any additional GPU.</p>
<p>VivoBook also comes with a fingerprint sensor to add a layer of security to the device and the data in it. This is certainly one of the rare finds in a laptop priced at this range.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the hardware is concerned, the laptop&#8217;s RAM can be upgraded up to 16GB, and its hard drive is also swappable with solid state drive. So, overall ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is a future-proof device which not only provides all current generation hardware specifications but also ensures that it stays up to date with time.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The VivoBook comes with a VGA front-facing camera, and like most of the other laptops in the segment, the front camera on the device is just serviceable. It can capture decent images in daylight conditions and fails to add details under low-light. The image rendering of the device’s camera is quick and is able enough to capture fleeting moments during a video call. There’s nothing exceptional about the webcam on this laptop, and at the same time, do note that there’s nothing to complain as well.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the ports and connectivity options on the VivoBook, it comes with a standard set of ports, which is more or less a common practice in most of the laptops. All the ports are uniformly distributed along the two sides of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Ports and Slots" width="800" height="370" /></p>
<p>The device comes with one USB 3.1 and one USB 3.0 port, for faster, reliable, and efficient data transfers. And, comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports for adding up additional peripherals. It also houses an HDMI, 3.5mm Audio Jack, and an SD card reader.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop comes with Windows 10 Home variant pre-installed. Windows 10, which is world&#8217;s most used computer operating system, needs no introduction of what it’s capable of. The laptop doesn’t come with any much of the bloatware and is, therefore, fast, efficient, and nag-free. The device, however, does come pre-installed with some of the productive aspects and tools, which ought to increase the overall productivity of the system.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to its powerful and most importantly, the latest set of hardware and innards, the VivoBook offers excellent performance for the budget. No matter how strong the specifications are on paper, what actually matters is its real-time usage and performance. And during our usage and hands-on with this sleek and stylish looking laptop, we were satisfied with its overall performance.</p>
<p>The laptop stays quiet and offers decent graphic-based tasks performance. That said, as the laptop doesn’t come with a specific dedicated graphics coprocessor, the gaming on the device might not cater hardcore gamers. However, thankfully, it can handle small to mediocre demanding games quite well, thanks to the Intel&#8217;s integrated UHD 620 graphics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Gaming Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Multimedia stands as a common stop for all sorts of laptop users. Be it gamers, businessmen, students, regular home purpose, no matter what the need is, a laptop will undeniably be used as a source of multimedia.</p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA comes with Two Built-in Stereo Speakers which provides very powerful and thumping audio output. During our review, we tested the speakers with bass heavy, punchy tracks, accustomed mids, and also treble stationed lean tracks. And to our surprise, the sound was pretty clear on all the occasions.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, it can handle almost all forms of videos and codecs. 4K and Full HD videos were playing absolutely lag-free and thanks to its wide viewing angles, we actually had a good time watching content on this laptop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Battery Life</span></p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA was one among the very first laptop we tested, which came along with the 8th Gen Intel core processors and we must say, the chipsets are very power efficient and robust. The laptop offers decent battery backup and is probably way ahead of most of its rivals in the segment.</p>
<p>On a single charge, the laptop stays juiced up for about 5-6 hours of continuous usage. It takes just over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. The battery type on this laptop is a Li-Ion one, and our final comments on the battery life would be <em>&#8216;The laptop did not fail us in terms of battery life,&#8217;</em> while most others in this price range don&#8217;t provide this good specs and battery life for the price!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2960 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Not every laptop in the market comes with the latest 8th Gen Intel core processors and decent battery life. Even if they do, they will certainly not look as polished and solid as the ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop. Moreover, the price point of $500 makes this laptop an unarguably one of the better offerings you can get currently in the market. Provided, you are not looking for a gaming-stationed laptop.</p>
