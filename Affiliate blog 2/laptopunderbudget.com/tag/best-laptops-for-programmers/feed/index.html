										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are just starting off with programming as a student or you are a software engineer for a well-established firm or you are an entrepreneur building something revolutionary by coding, a laptop is what you need to program all your ideas into reality. Buying the best laptop for programming is not an easy task. You have to check a lot of different things based on what programming language you use and what type of programming you do. So, what are those essential things to check on a programmer’s laptop? And, what are the best laptops for programming available to buy in the market?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;one-stop shop guide, to&nbsp;answer all your questions and help you to buy the best laptop for programming or coding for yourself.<span id="more-1433"></span></p>
<p>Before we proceed with the list of best laptops for developers, let&#8217;s understand the &#8211;</p>
<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-outline vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">

	</div><h3>5 Important Things You Should Know Before Buying a&nbsp;Laptop For Programming</h3>
<hr>
<p>Programming is a broad niche, and there are a lot of programming languages which you can use to code. So, a programmer’s laptop should be adequately specced to run all programming language compilers, interpreters, local servers, and code editors efficiently. But, what should be an ideal configuration of a laptop that will be used specifically for “programming”? or what are the essential things, that all programmers should know before they buy the laptop for coding and programming?</p>
<p>Well, here they are&#8230;</p>
<h4>#1 What is the best Operating System for developers?</h4>
<p>When it comes to&nbsp;coding and development, Microsoft Windows and Apple&nbsp;macOS have been&nbsp;the most used operating systems&nbsp;for years.&nbsp;The OS which we prefer most for the&nbsp;programmer&#8217;s laptop is&nbsp;&#8211; &#8216;Microsoft Windows&#8217; because it supports most of the&nbsp;programming languages and also MacBooks are costlier than Windows laptops, so not everyone can&nbsp;afford it.</p>
<p>Well, If you are an iOS or any other Apple’s ecosystem developer or if you are planning to learn it and going to become one then you’ll have to buy a Mac for yourself. Because Objective C and Swift requires Xcode which is only available for Mac right now and Apple has no plans to make it available on any other operating systems yet.</p>
<p>Linux is also an excellent option for Python, Ruby on Rails and PHP developers, but Windows also supports them all. So, overall Windows is preferred OS for all programmers and developers work machines, but for Apple developers, the Mac is a must.</p>
<h4>#2 Choosing&nbsp;processor of&nbsp;a laptop for programming &#8211;</h4>
<p>‘CPU aka processor is the brain of every computer, ’ and whether you’re developing a website or a mobile app, you’ll undoubtedly need a laptop with a powerful processor to run all those demanding programs you use to code and to run that code. We&nbsp;think <a title="Our Top Picks for Best i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops with Intel i5 processor</a>&nbsp;will be able to suffice requirements of most of the&nbsp;programmers, but&nbsp;if you are into something intensive like game developing or programming in graphics, then we recommend <a title="Our Top Picks of Best Intel i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/">laptops powered by Intel i7 processor</a>&nbsp;to you (hexa-core if you can afford).</p>
<p>For beginners in programming and budget buyers, even <a title="Our Top Picks of Intel i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops with Intel i3 processor</a> will get the job done but try to buy an Intel i5 powered laptop for programming if you can. That would make your purchase future proof.</p>
<h4>#3&nbsp;How much RAM should your computer have to run your code?</h4>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Remember -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px">More you have, more programs you’ll be able to run simultaneously and easier it will be, to switch between all the running applications.</div></div>
<p>Well, that doesn’t mean you should spend all your hard earned money to get the most RAM on your computer. But, it’s always good to have more RAM on a laptop to efficiently run local servers, compilers, code editor and a web browser simultaneously. We recommend at least 8GB of RAM for programming laptop but again, if you’re into game developing or graphics programming then you’re going to need 12 or 16GB of RAM.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Recommended&nbsp;Read &#8211; <a title="Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best High Performance Gaming Laptops Under $1500</a></strong></em></p>
<h4>#4 Hard Drive or Solid State Drive on a&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;for&nbsp;programmers?</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s keep it straight and simple, HDDs are&nbsp;slower (but completely usable) hence they are found mostly on <a title="Laptop Buying Guides to Buy Best Budget Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/budget-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheaper laptops</a> and SSDs are faster (a lot faster actually) than HDDs which are mostly found in&nbsp;<a title="Our Top Picks For Best Laptops Under $700" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops priced higher than $600</a>. Well, if we talk about laptops for programming specifically, then SSDs are&nbsp;really beneficial to programmers. They significantly decrease the booting time of a laptop, and it also helps in&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;loading your previously&nbsp;saved project to continue work from where you left off.</p>
<p>Most of the laptops with hard drives will give you a 1TB of storage whereas laptops with solid state drives in same price range offer significantly less storage (256GB or 512GB) compared to hard drives. So, we leave this on to you. If you want blazingly fast storage and can work with lesser space, then go with SSD and if you want more storage space which operates at lower yet reasonably good speeds, then go with HDD. <em>Simple!</em></p>
<h4>#5 Do you need&nbsp;dedicated graphics for programming?</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s good to have it but not necessarily because integrated graphics on new coffee lake and kaby lake Intel CPUs are more than enough to run most of the programs that you will be using for coding on your laptop.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s good to have it, if you also&nbsp;like to&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play games occasionally on your laptop</a>. 2GB dedicated graphics are enough for programming and gaming but again if you are into game developing or coding graphics, then you will need better graphics backed laptop for yourself.</p>
<p>Apart from these aforementioned 5 important things, a programmer’s laptop should also have a comfortable keyboard with decent traveling keys and good display (IPS recommended) to reduce eye strain while prolonged late night coding sessions. Good battery life and lightweight design will also be a huge plus in a laptop for programming.</p>
</div>
</div></div></div></div>
<p>Now, you might have got all your doubts cleared and questions answered about buying a laptop for programming yourself.</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the list of best laptops for developers, I would request&nbsp;you to select the operating system for your laptop.</p>
<p>Based on your&nbsp;favorite programming language or the programming language which you&#8217;ll be using on a daily basis, pick the right OS that&#8217;ll suit best to your programming needs. (Refer #1 point above to decide which operating system is best for you).</p>
<p>Pre-deciding this will&nbsp;help you to&nbsp;pick&nbsp;the best work machine for your coding requirements from below given list of laptops.</p>
<p>If you are ready, let&#8217;s begin with the list of best laptops for programming. Shall we?</p>

<h3 id="L5">5. Apple MacBook Air 13 <span class="su-label su-label-type-info">An affordable Mac&nbsp;for programming</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2FDy0jU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4660 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Apple-MacBook-Air-2018.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Air 13 - Affordable Mac for Programming or Coding" width="550" height="353"></a></p>
<p>The 2018 MacBook Air is a powerful and&nbsp;sexy looking&nbsp;laptop for Apple developers with around $1000 budget.&nbsp;It has unibody design which&nbsp;weighs less than 3 pounds&nbsp;and&nbsp;not to mention,&nbsp;that&nbsp;it is one of the best-looking laptop currently available in the market.</p>
<p>It has got 13.3-inch Retina display&nbsp;with anti-reflective coating and impressive viewing angles&nbsp;and it also has a backlit keyboard with butterfly mechanism. On the hardware front, this laptop is powered by dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage.&nbsp;It outputs enough power to easily run all your programming softwares, emulators etc. and despite having a&nbsp;fanless design, it&nbsp;manages to keep laptop always at&nbsp;comfortable temperatures.</p>
<p>The only letdown with the new MacBook Air is, just like the new MacBook Pros it also comes only with the USB Type-C ports, so if you have to connect peripherals frequently to your laptop then you&#8217;ll have to start living dongle life.</p>
<p>The 2018 MacBook Air 13 is currently the most affordable MacBook&nbsp;you can buy and we think it is the best laptop for programming for people who are looking for&nbsp;ultra-portable, good looking and a decent specced laptop for iOS and macOS apps and games development.</p>

<h3 id="L7">7. Dell G5 Series Laptop <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best High Performance Laptop for Programming</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Bs6bHc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3910 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dell-G5-series-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell G5 Series Laptop - Best Laptops for Programming and Gaming" width="550" height="363"></a></p>
<p>Dell G5 series has been&nbsp;referred as one of the best budget gaming laptops in our&nbsp;<a title="Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to buy gaming laptops under $1000</a> and we think because of its ergonomic backlit keyboard and decent battery life, it can also be used for programming, especially by the game developers and graphics programmers.</p>
<p>It has 15.6 inch full HD LED-backlit IPS display which is preferably good&nbsp;for&nbsp;coding and&nbsp;its backlit keyboard&nbsp;is perfect for typing and playing games. It is rocking inside 8th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU which produces throttling power from all the six cores to handle all your bulky programming softwares and apps pretty easily. It has got 16GB of RAM which can be further expanded up to 32GB&nbsp;and it has also got hybrid 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD drive inside which is also upgradable.</p>
<p>Dell G5 being such a high-performance laptop weighs around&nbsp;6 pounds, making it good enough travel with it in a backpack if you are a student.</p>
<p>It comes in various different variants with varying&nbsp;specs and prices. This particular model with 16GB RAM,six-core coffee lake&nbsp;i7, 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD and GTX 1050 Ti comes at <a href="https://amzn.to/2TERJTe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,099 from Amazon</a>. However, if you want a better graphics backed laptop then you can go with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2S3Vjo8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">variant</a>&nbsp;which offers Intel 8th Gen quad-core i5 processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. Dell is also selling a touchscreen variant of both these laptops with&nbsp;UHD resolution display which we think is not necessary for programming&nbsp;and 4K touchscreen will also eat more power,&nbsp;resulting into poor battery life of the laptop.</p>

The power of CPU and GPU is paired with 16GB of RAM and rather small yet speedy (and easily upgradable) 256GB SSD. Moreover, it has 15.6-inch full HD display with a 144Hz refresh rate. So, overall, it&#8217;s an excellent package for those who want a power packed and feature loaded machine for under $1000. However, don&#8217;t expect its battery to last longer. During our tests, the Acer Predator Helios 300 delivered the battery backup of just 4 hours, so you&#8217;ll have to keep the charger of this laptop with you wherever you go. | <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2WfQder" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Amazon</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkPad line of laptops is well-renowned among businesspeople because of its business proof design and powerful performance which comes paired with security features that one can rely upon.

<p>The changes are mainly on the inside which means the ThinkPad T590 comes with the latest Whiskey Lake 8th Gen processors and provides options to select RAM and storage up to 32GB and 1TB PCIe based SSD respectively. Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of entry-level dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU.

<h3 id="L10">10. HP Spectre x360 13&#8243; Convertible Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="http://tidd.ly/5a885226" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5444 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HP-Spectre-x360-2019.jpg" alt="HP Spectre x360 13-inch 2-in-1 Laptop 2019" width="550" height="352"></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for the most premium looking laptop for coding, then the 2019 HP Spectre x360 laptop will end your search here. With all-metal chassis finished in dark ash silver color with gold accents and sharp cut edges, the HP Spectre x360 is the sexiest looking laptop you can buy right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptop scores full marks in the design segment but it doesn&#8217;t lack behind in performance either. It comes in two sizes 13 and 15 inch. The <a title="Check Price on HP" href="http://tidd.ly/5a885226" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">13-inch models</a> can be configured with the newest 8th Gen Whiskey Lake Intel processors while the <a title="Check Price on HP" href="http://tidd.ly/48f1d37f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">15-inch variants</a> are powered by a powerful Coffee Lake six-core Intel processors with dedicated Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q GPU. Performance wise both are excellent, but if your programming work demands more power, then 15-inch would be a better option.</p>
<p>Speaking of its battery life, the 13-inch variant averages around 12 hours and for 15-inch variant its 9 hours which is rather great considering the kind of power they pack inside. Moreover, its keyboard is also excellent with the perfect layout, and its keys provide nice feel and feedback while typing. So, all in all, the HP Spectre x360 is a great convertible laptop that checks most of the boxes of the requirements of programmers. It has great looks, powerful and newest hardware and all-day battery life as well. However, it doesn&#8217;t come with the traditional ports. To achieve this sleek look, HP Spectre x360 accommodates just USB Type-C Thunderbolt ports and 3.5mm audio jack so if you don&#8217;t mind carrying and using dongles; then the HP Spectre x360 is one of the best convertible laptops for programmers who like to keep their style game on point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS was one of the very first brands among all the traditional laptop makers, to step into the gaming arena and challenge the pioneers like MSI and Alienware series of laptops. It all started with the ROG (Republic of Gamers) series of laptops from ASUS, which was not only priced competitively but was also a very good all-around performer. Soon after the company started to earn fame and reputation in the gaming arena, it started to release a series of laptops with the primary emphasis on gaming to attract a large audience.</p>
<p>Our current laptop, the ASUS FX502VM Gaming Laptop is one among the newly launched gaming series of laptop from ASUS, which is now one of the most selling gaming laptops at around $1000. The laptop does pack in some interesting set of specifications and also packs in a lot of additional features. We were initially surprised to hear about the intelligent thermal design and several other futuristic features of the laptop and therefore, decided to have a look at it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM looks thick and hefty right from the very first look. However, the laptop is very finely engineered and ergonomically built. The laptop comes with a curved chassis as seen on the ROG series with imposed curves with an ASUS logo imposed on the lid. The laptop is thick at the centre and gradually gets narrower towards the edges.</p>
<div id="attachment_1852" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-image-1852 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png" alt="Asus FX502VM Gaming Laptop - Dimensions" width="469" height="550" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png 469w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-256x300.png 256w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-43x50.png 43w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t see gaming laptops this thin more often!</p></div>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15.4 x 10.5 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weights around 4.9 pounds, which although isn&#8217;t that hefty for a gaming laptop, still feels a little cumbersome to carry around.</p>
<p>Both the sides of the laptop are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The laptop comes in matte finished colour giving a perfect gaming hue to the users. As soon as you open the lid, you see a very aggressive looking futuristic keyboard. The keyboard on the laptop comes with red backlit keys, which adapts a theme according to the game we play. Moreover, the trackpad on the laptop is also spaciously arranged in the body, giving it a perfect ease of usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_1853" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1853" class="wp-image-1853 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Keyboard-Touchpad" width="800" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad.png 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-300x155.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-768x396.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-610x314.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-600x309.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1853" class="wp-caption-text">Chiclet keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys offers 1.6mm tactile key strokes.</p></div>
<p>All in all, the ASUS FX502VM comes with a finely engineered futuristic design. The laptop feels really sturdy but is, unfortunately, slightly heavy to carry around.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Our ASUS FX502VM features a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. With these numbers kept in mind, it is quite vibrant enough for movies and games. As soon as we started testing out the laptop, we played some 4K content on it, to which the laptop’s display responded really well. When watching a 4K trailer of injustice: Gods among us, all the colours popped up really well with high colour gamut. Moreover, the viewing angles on the laptop are also really great and can easily cover over 160-degrees without getting smudged.</p>
<p>Our lab tests also proved the ASUS FX502VM’s impressive colour performance. The laptop managed to produce 184.7 percent of the sRGB colour gamut, which is by far one of the best we measured. That not only means that this display is bright and colourful, but also means that it is accurate than most of its rivals in the price segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_1855" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-image-1855 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Display" width="780" height="502" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png 780w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-300x193.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-768x494.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-610x393.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-600x386.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-caption-text">15 Inch Display with Full HD Resolution, 100% sRGB and Wide Viewing Angles.</p></div>
<p>During our entire review and usage, we never ever felt that the display on the ASUS FX502VM was even a bit dim. It is bright, vivid, colourful, and wide. As far as the benchmarking numbers are concerned, ASUS’s notebook managed to register an average brightness of 289 nits on our light meter, which is an edging out figure for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware on ASUS FX502VM: It is powered by a sixth generation gaming-centric Intel core i5-6300HQ mobile processor clocked at 2.3GHz. For multitasking, the processor is paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM. The laptop comes with thermal cooling technology, and thus makes use of dual cooling fans, to prevent the innards getting warm even under heavy usage.</p>

<p>As far as storage on the laptop is concerned, it comes with a 1TB of hard disk, with an RPM of 7200. This not only ensures faster data transfers but also ensures of being a reliable data storage medium. Graphics on the laptop are handled by NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics coprocessor with a dedicated DDR5 memory of 3GB. This is the new Pascal architecture based GPU from NVidia. Hence, Asus FX502VM is a VR Ready gaming laptop and it can run all 360° games, videos and other VR content without any problems.</p>
<p>ASUS FX502 has a specially-designed chiclet gaming keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys that offer the users a large 1.6mm of travel distance. Greater the travel distance, better is the tactile feedback for keystrokes. In addition to that, the laptop also features highlighted WASD keys for user convenience. The keyboard on this laptop is undoubtedly best for gaming, but apart from that it can also be used by <a title="Top Recommended Laptops for College for Every Budget" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students for college</a> or by <a title="The Best Laptops for Computer Programmers for Coding/Programming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers for coding</a> and playing games.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The laptop sports an HD Webcam on top of the display. The camera on this laptop is not the best you get at this budget but is adequate enough to meet the basic requirements of a typical laptop’s webcam. Yes, you can make Skype calls, and can even take few selfies during your leisure. On top of that, there is nothing much to be discussed in this section.</p>
<h4>Ports</h4>
<p>ASUS FX502VM crams a number of useful and productively usable ports onto its small frame. On the left side, you&#8217;ll find a proprietary power port, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI-out, an audio jack, 1x mini Display Port, and a microSD card reader.</p>

<p>The right side houses two USB 2.0 ports, which are more than good enough for most peripherals you might attach, but we wish there was another USB 3.0 so we could take advantage of the <a title="Shop External Hard Drives on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2htYAfG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fastest external hard drives available in market</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS FX502VM runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and is naturally, one of the flexible operating systems for laptops. The Windows 10, is not just good at UI but is also very productive. It has millions of apps, compatible with it and provides a deeper level of customizations to its users. Apart from all the standard lineup of Windows 10 applications and software, the ASUS FX502VM also packs in some of the ASUS’s proprietary applications of security and productivity.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with 1-year Accidental Damage Protection along with 30 days of Zero Bright Dot Guarantee, which is one of the most comprehensive coverages available for laptops. This gives you protection against accidental drops, spills and electrical surges of the laptop.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The laptop does deliver an outstanding performance in its class. Thanks to an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of hard disk drive, the laptop is surely a power-packed performer.</p>

<p>We personally feel that the laptop could have been even better if it had an SSD drive instead of HDD. During our usage, the laptop’s hard drive was reading data at 145MB/s and was writing at 135MB/s, so while nowhere near as fast as the SSD it&#8217;s clearly a decent 7200rpm model. Keeping the hard drive details aside, the laptop being a powerful gaming performer, can handle all the general daily essentials with ease. During our usage, we ran a couple of RAM consuming benchmarks, brewer with more than 15 tabs opened, music playing in the background, with a high-end game running in the background. The laptop was handling multitasking with ease and is a powerful, stable, and reliable daily performer.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, we can accolade the ASUS FX502VM for being a gaming-stationed laptop and to the fact that it is stuffed with the Nvidia’s latest GTX 1060 GPU (the main reason to get excited about this laptop). The laptop was able to handle Alien Isolation with all settings maxed out and resolution set to 1080p at an average 75fps. However, the laptop did face few hiccups at 188fps wherein the visuals dropped slightly.</p>
<p>We installed a long list of high-end games on this laptop, thanks to its massive 1TB of hard drive. We tested the laptop with our all time favourite The Witcher III, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm. The best part, the laptop was able to handle all these games with ease even with the graphics set to max. Surely, the laptop stands in its words- The best gaming laptop at the budget. So for all the gaming lovers out there who are slightly tight on budget, this is probably the best you can get.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, it is essential for the ASUS FX502VM to accommodate powerful, detailed, and loud stereo output. During our usage, we found the speakers are excellent and hold their ground. As we always mention, multimedia is one of the most vital aspects of any laptop and our contender is packed with dual HD stereo speakers with DTS tech-enabled, which does the task of providing punchy audio pretty well.</p>
<div id="attachment_1860" style="width: 866px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1860" class="size-full wp-image-1860" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review.jpg" alt="Powerful speakers and stunning display" width="856" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review.jpg 856w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-300x140.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-768x359.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-610x285.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-600x280.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1860" class="wp-caption-text">Asus FX502VM features audio by Ice Power</p></div>
<p>We tested the speakers with bass heavy punchy tracks such as no church in the west and power bass, to which the speakers on the laptop responded really well. We also tested the laptop with treble based cleaner tracks, to which it responded well again. The laptop can play all sorts of HD content including 4K with ease. After all, this packs in the latest Nvidia’s GTX 1060!</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM is juiced using a 4-cell Lithium-ion battery. After all our usage, all we can say is the laptop does provide an outstanding battery backup. That said, being a gaming-stationed laptop, we honestly, didn&#8217;t expect much from it. The laptop lasted for just over 4 hours under continuous gaming, which is still a decent backup for a laptop with this configuration and features. However, if you aren&#8217;t gaming continuously you can expect slightly better battery backup. The laptop can be charged fully from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Bottom line: <em>Are you a hardcore gamer but slightly tight on budget? Go for it blindfolded!</em></h3>
<p>With a price tag of around $1250, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASUS FX502VM 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</span> is undoubtedly our first choice, if you need a power-packed gaming machine. Moreover, there aren&#8217;t many laptops at this price point which is primarily meant for gaming. Although the laptop is not as powerful as the ASUS’s flagship ROG series of laptops or the MSI’s dominators, it still is a very efficient, reliable, and powerful all-round performer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is an internationally-renowned information technology company which has extended its business to a wide-variety of hardware and PC components including laptops. Ever since its inception in the year 1939, the company has managed to win in almost all the IT peripheral related segments and today, the company is in the top 5 laptop and PC makers in the world.</p>
<p>HP always does a commendable job, when it comes to providing powerful configuration, without compromising on the design elements, which most of the companies trade-off. Speaking about our current HP 15-ay013nr, the laptop is a powerful daily performer and the brand has continued it&#8217;s traditional, yet pleasing design elements with top-of-the-line hardware at a cutting-edge price. We have been using this laptop for the past couple of weeks, and this is what we think of this laptop.</p>

<p>The first thing which we noticed when we started using the laptop is its beautifully crafted chassis. Although the HP 15-ay013nr isn&#8217;t any thinner than most of its rivals in the segment, it is undoubtedly a very well built laptop with pleasing aesthetics.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1662" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design.jpeg" alt="HP 15-ay013nr 15.6 Inch Full HD Laptop Design" width="750" height="503" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design.jpeg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design-610x409.jpeg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design-600x402.jpeg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design-210x140.jpeg 210w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Design-50x34.jpeg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />With the dimensions of 15.12 and 10.02-inches, this laptop measures same as almost all the 15-inch laptops out in the market. Sadly, the laptop isn&#8217;t thinner and is 0.95 inches thick. But if one is ready to overlook, the thickness of the laptop, it offers a very polished textured linear grooves along with horizontal brushing in metal shades. Moreover, the laptop weighs around 4.6 pounds which are pretty good and light for a laptop with these measures.</p>
<p>The laptop is entirely made up of plastic, but it doesn&#8217;t feel cheap by any means. The rear of the laptop comes with a polished ‘HP’ logo as seen on most of the HP laptops. As soon as you open the lid of this laptop, you&#8217;ll see a 15.6-inch display packed in a slim and sleek plastic bezel. On the other hand, you will see an island-style complete keyboard along with a number pad and few other additional company’s proprietary menu buttons.</p>
<p>Speaking about the keyboard and trackpad on the laptop, it comes with a standard and well-spaced keyboard, which are sad, not backlit. Although this might be a deal-breaker for few users, it&#8217;s not always a major point of concern. The keys were neatly curved to the centre, providing a good response and grip during our usage. We tested the keyboard’s capabilities using TypingTest.com and I managed to score around 126 words per minute with five errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my <a title="$899 on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2dI9ewE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Air</a>. Do note that MacBooks are one of the best available series of laptops for document editing and making. That said, the HP 15-ay013nr is packed with an able keyboard minus backlit keys.</p>

<p>It is provided with a 4.5 x 2.2-inch Synaptics touchpad, which was pretty accurate and responsive. It also has gesture support options such as pinching to zoom, scrolling with two fingers, and selecting multiple files with three fingers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The chassis is finely-engineered and as a result, the design is neat and far from being clumsy. you also get a decent deck space with this laptop. On a simple conclusive note, the laptop looks like most of the HP laptops plus a pleasing aesthetics.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Display</h3>
<p>HP 15-ay013nr sports a 15.6-inch Full-HD display combined with the latest SVA anti-glare WLED technology to provide rich colour contrast. The display comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which is good considering the size.</p>
<p>The laptop provides a long-listing of display setup controls, which allows its users to change the colour hues and adjust brightness. We downloaded some 4K video content on this laptop and the colour reproduction was commendable considering the price at which it is available.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1663" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="HP 15 ay013nr Laptop Display" width="800" height="517" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display.jpg 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display-300x194.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display-768x496.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display-610x394.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display-600x388.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-Laptop-Display-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Best Laptops Under $500 - Top PIcks" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Under $500 &#8211; Our Top Picks</a></strong></p>
<p>During our display benchmarking tests, the laptop’s display managed to reproduce 79.2 percent in the sRGB colour gamut, which is very good in this budget. Moreover, the WLED technology used in the making of display gains it an upper hand over its rivals when it comes to the viewing experience and angles. When it came to the brightness of the screen, the HP 15-ay013nr outshone almost of its competition and managed to reach an average of 315 nits.</p>
<p>So yet again, the display remains the strong point of this laptop and is capable of passing all the checklists set by its users with flying colour (quite-literally).</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The HP 15-ay013nr is stuffed with a long list of powerful hardware for the asking price. Under the hood, the latest 6th generation dual-core Intel Core i5-6200U processor is the show-stealer. The laptop comes with a clock speed of 2.3GHz which can be turbo boosted up to 2.8GHz for the power usage. It comes with 3MB of L3 cache space, to provide faster memory mapping.</p>
<p>The processor is paired with an 8 GB of DDR3L SDRAM. The processor and RAM paired together can handle almost any of the daily task you throw at it with ease. Moreover, the abundant RAM also lets its users multi-task at a go. As far as the graphics processor in this laptop is concerned, it comes with an integrated Intel HD 520 graphic card with up to 4169 MB of total dedicated graphics memory. The laptop comes with a Super-Multi DVD Burner, which can read/write files from a DVD disk.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a customising configuration option, in which the user can decide on the vital aspects of the laptops such as hard disk size, RAM, and more. In terms of memory, the user is provided with either a 128GB of solid state drive or a 1TB of hard disk space out of the box. Although the pricing might vary accordingly, it lets the user decide on these aforementioned specifications. But personally, we prefer SSD over a normal HDD for the faster data transfer speeds. So, you might consider buying an additional hard drive for data storage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>HP 15-ay013nr comes with a 720p advanced HD camera, which can capture images with good details and vibrant colour gamut. The 720p webcam on this laptop adjusts the image quickly and doesn&#8217;t lag in any manner. The camera is pretty ideal for video calls and can also take adequate photos. The colours reproduced in this laptop, were, however, a bit warm. Moreover, the laptop comes with the HP’s proprietary ‘Snapfish’ tool, which lets the user access their photos from multiple devices at a time.</p>
<p>During the sample shots, we shot using the laptop’s webcam. The colour reproduction and other vital aspects were very satisfactory. However, the colours at the edges sometimes tend to wash out.</p>
<h4>Ports</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1665" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports.jpg" alt="HP 15-ay013nr Ports and Slots" width="983" height="292" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports.jpg 983w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports-300x89.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports-768x228.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports-610x181.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports-600x178.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hp-15-ay013nr-ports-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" />The HP 15-ay013nr sports one USB 3.0 port for blazing fast file and data transfers. Dual USB 2.0 ports to allow you plug in multiples peripherals at a time. The laptop comes with a Digital Media Card Reader for Secure data accessing from a digital SD. In addition to them, it also comes with a DVD writer, which can read/write from disks.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The HP 15-ay013nr runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and has a bit of preinstalled software (bloatware), but at least a decent portion will be useful for work. Our review unit included Skype along with Skype for business and a suite of software from CyberLink: PowerDVD for video playback, YouCam webcam software and Power2Go to burn discs. You also get a very useful HP Software Setup program, which allows its users to update all the system drivers and manage the installations of Windows and other HP-recommended applications.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The laptop also comes with all the standard line-up of Windows 10 applications and includes all the support from Windows in the near future.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Performance</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1666" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Review-Performance-Tests.jpg" alt="HP 15-ay013nr 15.6-Inch Full HD Laptop Review Performance Tests" width="700" height="553" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Review-Performance-Tests.jpg 700w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Review-Performance-Tests-300x237.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Review-Performance-Tests-610x482.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Review-Performance-Tests-600x474.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-ay013nr-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Review-Performance-Tests-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />Thanks to all its powerful innards, the laptop possess, the performance is top-notch in its segment. That said, the laptop was able to withstand all our daily heavy-duty applications without a lag. Moreover, multi-tasking was butter smooth. At times, the processor was forced to enter its turbo mode, to handle heavy applications. During this, the laptop started heating. Although, it wasn&#8217;t a major heating issue but was considerable. As mentioned earlier, it was a pretty fine multitasking machine, allowing me to keep over 30 tabs open in Chrome with few of them streaming 4K content from YouTube, and I hardly noticed any lag.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the laptop comes with Intel integrated graphics and is surely not a gaming stationed laptop. Now before you get dishearten, we would like to share some interesting benchmark results for this laptop, it managed to score a surprising 64,231 on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. We tested the laptop with graphic-intense games such as Witcher III and heroes of the storm. Although the laptop struggled to play these games at graphics set to maximum, it was pretty much playable in graphics set to medium-low.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1667" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-1y013nr-Gaming-Test.jpg" alt="HP 15-1y013nr Gaming Tests" width="700" height="533" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-1y013nr-Gaming-Test.jpg 700w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-1y013nr-Gaming-Test-300x228.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-1y013nr-Gaming-Test-610x464.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-1y013nr-Gaming-Test-600x457.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HP-15-1y013nr-Gaming-Test-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>However, we would advise you not to choose this laptop, if your primary concern is gaming. For rest, do keep note of the benchmarking scores and yeah, the laptop can still play high-end games.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>HP never let its users down, when it comes to multimedia experience. Accordingly, the HP 15-ay013nr comes with dual-stereo speakers. The speakers on the laptop can easily fill a room with its sound. When we played bass heavy tracks such as “No Church in The Wild” the sound was crisp and punchy. We also tested the speakers with “Owl-city Fireflies” and the vocals and sharp treble was kept to its standards. On an overall note, the speakers are very punchy and can deliver very good sound output.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is yet another commendable aspect of this laptop. It comes with a Li-Ion battery, which the company claims that the laptop can provide over 7 hours of continuous usage. However, we were sceptical about this and we put the laptop to test by ourselves. We managed to get slightly over 5 hours of continuous usage on a single charge, which included a continuous network reception, multimedia, gaming, and benchmarking.</p>
<p>The laptop took 2 hours 45 minutes to charge fully from 0 to 100, which is normal for a laptop this calibre.</p>

<h3>Bottom line &#8211; Just Go For It!</h3>
<p>We just loved the HP 15-ay013nr, almost in terms of everything minus few minor aspects. The laptop offers top-of-the-line specifications and a powerful and reliable Windows 10 OS, which makes the deal even sweeter. Reliable battery life, commendable multimedia experience, sturdy performance, and pleasing aesthetics are the strong points to buy this laptop, and as we always mention, if your budget is under $500, and you are not an avid gamer, then look no further, as this laptop will not disappoint you in any means.</p>
