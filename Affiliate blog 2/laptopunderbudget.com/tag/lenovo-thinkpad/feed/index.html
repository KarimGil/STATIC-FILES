										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where most manufacturers use the Mobile World Congress as a platform to announce their latest mobile gadgets, Lenovo used MWC 2019 to announce their latest line of refreshed ThinkPad T Series and X series laptop, set to release in June later this year.</p>
<p>Easily the most well-known and popular of their ThinkPad line of laptops, the latest refreshes all share one trait in common — all of them will be equipped with the latest Intel Whiskey Lake processors.</p>
<h2>Say Hello to the Refreshed ThinkPad T Series Laptops</h2>
<p>The headliner of the latest refreshed T Series laptops is the Lenovo ThinkPad T490s.</p>
<p>Released as the successor to the widely popular Lenovo Thinkpad T480s, the T490s sports a thinner chassis at 0.63-inches over the T480s&#8217; 0.72-inch chassis. Also, it can come equipped with up to a super bright 500-nit HDR screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. An option to have slightly less brighter 400-nit, 1920 x 1080 display is also available for those who are willing to sacrifice aesthetics for a longer battery life. Both versions of the T490s&#8217; 14-inch screen will come with a PrivacyGuard panel to help hide the content of your screen from prying eyes.</p>
<p>Specs-wise, the T490s can come with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD, 32GB of DDR4 ram, and a battery expected to last up to 20 hours unplugged.</p>
<div id="attachment_5331" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-image-5331 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Refreshed-T400-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Refreshed T400 Laptops" width="1200" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-caption-text"><i>Image &#8211; Lenovo</i></p></div>
<p>Next up is the entry-level ThinkPad T490, the follow-up to the ThinkPad T480. It has a much-thinner bezel compared to its predecessor and comes with the same set of privacy features as the T490s, as well as an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card upgrade and the same 500-nit, 2560 x 1440 resolution HDR display.</p>
<p>Finally, their bulkiest and biggest of them all, the T590 will use the additional real estate to over a high-res 4K display, complete with 500 nits of brightness and Dolby Vision color.</p>
<p>Similar to the T490, the T590 can come equipped with an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card. It will also feature the new single-battery RapidCharge technology by Lenovo and will be nearly half a pound lighter compared to the 4.29-pound ThinkPad T580 at just 3.87 pounds.</p>
<h2>Expected Released Date of the Refreshed ThinkPad Laptops</h2>
<p>All three of the refreshed T Series laptops will arrive sometime in June in the United States. However, those in Europe can have their hands on the T490 and the T590 as early as this March; the T490s will arrive in Europe in April.</p>
<p>As for the pricing, the T490 is the cheapest of the bunch with a starting price point of $999. The T590 is next at $1,029, followed by the T490s at $1,279.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the midst of MWC 2019, Lenovo is taking huge leaps for upgrading their ThinkPad lineup. The laptop giant Lenovo, announced their latest additions &#8211; the X390, and X390 Yoga to the ThinkPad portfolio.</p>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390</h3>
<p>Lenovo has bumped up the display from 12 to a 13-inch, but the best part is that the overall form factor of the device has not been compromised. As expected in 2019, Lenovo has introduced 50% slimmer bezels which has resulted in an even slimmer machine than before, rounding to 0.6 inches thin and weighing just 2.7 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5322" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Launched-at-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Launched at MWC 2019" width="700" height="517" /></p>
<p>Inside, there is an 8th Gen Intel Core vPro i7 processor, up to 32GB of RAM, and storage goes up to 1TB. The ports selection on the ThinkPad X390 includes a Thunderbolt 3, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1, an HDMI input slot, a microSD card slot, alongside a Kensington lock, and a single jack for mic and headset connectivity. Lenovo has also promised for the laptop to deliver up to 17 hours of power backup and also introduced some nifty security features. Like the PrivacyGuard that utilizes the built-in IR camera to detect snoopers behind you- enabling alerts and using the ThinkShutter to tone down the brightness for prying eyes only.</p>
<p>The screen options on the ThinkPad X390 include a basic 13.3-inch, 1080p touch display with 300 nits of brightness and a 13.3-inch, 1080p PrivacyGuard non-touch alternative with 400 nits brightness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Top Picks of Laptops For Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga</h3>
<p>Now, Lenovo&#8217;s Yoga series has been a portable marvel for all travelers and on-the-run kind of consumers. Its refreshing to see that alongside the X390, the X390 Yoga is also getting a boost. Toning down an already slim screen, the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 will be 2 percent thinner to 9.6 inches and 5 percent lighter to just 2.9 lbs from its previous version.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5323" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Yoga-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga - MWC 2019" width="815" height="500" /></p>
<p>The only display option on the Yoga X390 is a 13.3 inch display, 1080p IPS touch screen and 300 nits of brightness. Such neat specs really doesn&#8217;t let you miss the lack of variety in it.</p>
<p>With the same processing capacity and storage as its sibling, the Yoga X390 can only be bumped up to 16 GB of RAM. The battery life is also toned down and can go up to just 14.5 hours. With an integrated HD Graphics 620 GPU, the ports gallery on this one remains the same as the ThinkPad X390. What&#8217;s unique in this one is the <strong>LTE connectivity</strong> (with the Wi-Fi 6 protocol that has been configured into both models) and a stylus pen that seems like an essential for all portables. But the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 does lack the PrivacyGuard feature without losing the HD camera and the ThinkShutter cover.</p>
<p>However, both sibling share the dual far-field noise-canceling microphones, delivering top-notch voice output during conferencing and while using smart assistants.</p>
<p>Both laptops are expected to hit the shelves in May. The ThinkPad X390 is starting from $1,099, and the Yoga variant from $1,359.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we hear the term &#8216;business laptops&#8217; our first instinct is to inch away as the name mostly endears high-end users. Even for users who&#8217;s lifestyle demands sleek and powerful machines, are often forced into settling for less. Given ofcourse the price sensitivity. Lenovo has thought outside of this social convention with their two latest releases. The Lenovo ThinkPad L390 and Lenovo ThinkPad L390 Yoga.</p>
<p>Now we are aware that these laptops might not fit the exact definition of &#8216;versatile professional laptops&#8217; but they do come pretty close and are a step in the right direction. Let&#8217;s see what Lenovo has to offer.</p>
<h3>Display, Size, and Weight</h3>
<p>While both laptops sport a 13.3 inch full HD touchscreen display, the Yoga L390 is a flexible version of its sibling. Yoga can be twisted and turned into almost every angle whereas, the L390 supports a 180-degree hinge and can be laid out flat on a surface. However, it is slightly lighter than its more flexible counterpart.</p>
<div id="attachment_4815" style="width: 785px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4815" class="wp-image-4815 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lenovo-ThinkPad-L390-Yoga.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad L390 Yoga" width="775" height="533" /><p id="caption-attachment-4815" class="wp-caption-text">Lenovo ThinkPad L390 Yoga</p></div>
<p>Its total weight rounds up to 3.2 lbs, a fraction less than the Lenovo Yoga L390 that weighs up to 3.44 lbs and is just 8.8&#8243; in width. The ThinkPad L390 Yoga does come with an additional plus that is the Active Stylus pen support that can be placed in its built-in garage slot. Sweetening the deal up a bit more, it sports a full 360-degree hinge to use it as a tablet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Artists with Pen Support</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Processor and Power</h3>
<p>These svelte notebooks are powered up by the newest 8th Gen Intel Whiskey Lake processors and they can support up to 32GB of DDR4 memory and up to 512GB of PCIe solid-state storage. The port selection on these ultrabooks include two USB Type-C ports, a couple of USB 3.1 ports, HDMI 1.4 and mini Ethernet jacks, along with a microSD card reader.</p>
<p>Of course, these high-end notebooks are not left without fingerprint sensors. They also come with Lenovo&#8217;s encrypting data on its dTPM 2.0 chip.</p>
<h3>Camera and Battery</h3>
<p>Here we will again see the Yoga L390 taking the spotlight. It sports a webcam (without ThinkShutter) and an IR camera with Windows Hello compatibility for quick logins.</p>
<p>For the battery, Lenovo has featured both its latest ultrabooks with 45 WHr batteries. Lenovo has promised for the non-convertible L390 to deliver up to 14 hours of battery life and 12 hours for Yoga.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>Both of the sleek and flexy books come in silver and black colors. The laptops are expected to break the shelves this month with prices starting from $659 for a basic Lenovo ThinkPad L390 and $889 for the ThinkPad L390 Yoga.</p>
