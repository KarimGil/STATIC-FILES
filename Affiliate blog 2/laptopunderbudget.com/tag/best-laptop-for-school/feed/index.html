<h3 id="L1">1. Acer Aspire 1 <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Inexpensive Laptop for College</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2LNWs4t" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/acer-aspire-1-a114-32-c1ya.jpg" alt="Acer-Aspire-1 best cheap laptops for students" width="500" height="310"></a>Acer is a widely renowned international brand and is very well reputed in the field of laptops. The company understands the needs of every user covering every niche and accordingly release various laptops with good specifications at the asking price. And when it comes to a laptop for college, whatever may be the need, budget is a strict constraint. A students laptop has to be reliable and must satisfy the budget constraint.</p>
<p>To satisfy the above maxim, Acer introduced its Aspire 1, a 14-inch lightweight Notebook, which is not hard on the pocket but is packed with features, every student would love to have. Sporting a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14-inch Full HD display</span>, this laptop is powered by a dual-core Intel Celeron N4000 processor paired with 4GB of RAM.

<blockquote><p>The <strong>Dell XPS 13 2-in-1</strong> is also excellent option for college if you are looking to purchase a premium 2-in-1 laptop. Its price starts from $1000 which is slightly higher than the starting price of the standard XPS 13, but it offers the same nearly borderless 13.3-inch full HD InfinityEdge touchscreen display which can be rotated 360 degrees and premium aluminum chassis. It is powered by the Intel&#8217;s Y-series processor family, which is less powerful than the quad-core chips on standard XPS 13, but it will be enough for everyday college requirements. However, the webcam on the XPS 13 2-in-1 is nose peeking one like older XPS models, but you can rotate the display and use the webcam in tablet mode to avoid that. | <a title="Best Price on Dell" href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-9365-2-in-1-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Dell</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see in the specs, the Acer Aspire 1 is powered by the Intel Celeron N4000 dual-core processor, which is based on Gemini Lake. The CPU has a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz and can boost to 2.6 GHz. The chip also comes with 4 MB of L2 cache. This is the same CPU that you get in the HP Stream 14. Other than that, you get 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>With that said, let&#8217;s begin with our review of Acer Aspire 1, talking about each aspect of the laptop, one by one.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 is an entry-level laptop from Acer, so there isn&#8217;t really anything fancy about the design but it is still a robust machine, and overall it is very clean. The exterior of the laptop looks stylish, especially the brushed aluminum finish on the lid with silver Acer logo in the center. On opening the lid, you&#8217;ll find the same finish around the keyboard and touchpad area as well. While there is nothing to brag about the design of this laptop, it manages not to look cheap.</p>
<div id="attachment_4885" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-image-4885 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Textured-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Textured Lid" width="700" height="525" /><p id="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Brushed Aluminum Finish on the Lid</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, there are certain design flaws on this laptop, and one of them is its bad speaker placement. The laptop has two speakers at the bottom, one on either side, and its poor placement muffled the sound everytime I used the laptop from my lap. If we talk about the sound quality, then it isn&#8217;t that great either. Its two speakers do get loud enough to fill the small-sized room, but I felt a lack of clarity while listening to music. But, considering that this is a $200 laptop, some sacrifice needed to be made, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Talking about the internal design, getting to the internals of this laptop was very hard. I had to open fifteen screws and had to pull the back panel off to gain access to the parts, but that&#8217;s fine because there are no upgradable parts inside the laptop. The RAM and storage drive is soldered on the motherboard, and that makes users stuck with its low 4GB of RAM which kind of bottlenecks its overall performance (more on this later). Moreover, the internal design is fanless so you won&#8217;t be hearing any fan noise when you use the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_4886" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-image-4886 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Internal-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Internal Design" width="667" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Internal Design | RAM Soldered on Motherboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall the Acer Aspire 1 has decent build quality. The materials used do not feel like this is an entry-level device. The texture on the lid adds to the premiums of the laptop, and the laptop not only looks impressive but feels great as well. The device is pretty light, and you can easily take it with you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for College Students for Every Budget and College Major</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h4>
<p>There are a couple of useful ports on this laptop that make it great for the price. You get an ethernet port that will allow you to plug in an ethernet cable if you want faster internet speeds and do not want to rely on a wireless connection. You also have an HDMI output port that will deliver 4K at 30 FPS. On the left, you have a USB 3.0 port to transfer data faster. You also get an SD card slot, but the card sticks out which can be an issue if you were looking to expand laptop&#8217;s limited storage with the SD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4887" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Left-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Left Side Ports" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you have the combo jack for headphones and two more USB 2.0 ports. These are slower ports that can be used to connect a mouse or other devices that do not require higher throughput.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Right-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="382" /></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you will be able to take advantage of high-speed internet and routers that use 5 GHz frequencies. The laptop also offers Bluetooth 4.1 which can be used to connect wireless devices like a mouse or a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display on the Aspire 1 is a 14-inch TN panel which does not offer great viewing angles, and as expected it isn&#8217;t color accurate either. The bright side is that while the screen is the same size as the HP Stream 14, it has a higher resolution. That said, the Acer Aspire 1 is the only laptop in this price segment to offer full HD display making it the perfect budget option for binge watchers.</p>
<div id="attachment_4890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-image-4890 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 - Display Review" width="800" height="637" /><p id="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>14-inch Full HD Matte Display</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The screen is a bit dim, but it has a matte coating on top which does a great job of reducing reflections while using this laptop in well-lit areas. Overall, it is a pretty decent panel keeping in mind that this laptop costs just a little <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200</a>.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature is that the screen can be rotated more than 180 degrees. The Acer Aspire 1 is in no means a 2-in-1 device, so I do not really know what Acer is trying to do with this feature, but you can have the screen flat on a surface if you want. The hinge does have a bit of range, and that might keep the screen from snapping off.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Keyboard And Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard on the Acer Aspire 1 is very impressive, the keys have ample travel, and they are decent to type on. The keys are also a bit larger than usual which is great for typing. The only issue is that the placement of some keys can take a bit of getting used to. You will need to adjust to the arrangement of the small arrow keys and the buttons next to the Enter and Backspace keys. This is not a major issue, and once you have used the device for a few hours, you should get used to it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Review-Keyboard-and-Touchpad.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="750" height="590" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is much better than some previous <a title="All Acer Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> that we have used in the past, and the overall design is decent. The touchpad is not all that great though. It is a bit wobbly, but it will get the job done. It uses Windows Precision drivers and supports gestures as well. Compared to the HP Stream 14, the keyboard is fine, but the touchpad could have been better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks of Laptops for Writers with Comfortable Keyboards</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The webcam on the Aspire 1 is another thing after speakers that Acer has compromised to price it competitively. Acer has fitted a very bad webcam on this laptop which produces an unacceptable picture and video quality, even as per the budget laptop standards. The picture that I took of mine with its webcam came out entirely out of focus, grainy and with vanished colors.</p>
<p>So, if you have to make a lot of video calls everyday or attend the video conferences, then this is not the right laptop for you unless you are ready to spend a bit extra for an <a title="External Webcams on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LH16yf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">external webcam</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode which is excellent for students and individuals who need added security. For uninitiated, the S mode limits the third party apps that you can download, and you can only use apps that are verified by Microsoft and are available on the official Microsoft store. Well, if you don&#8217;t like it, opting out of the S mode is not an issue, and you can move to regular Windows 10 Home with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Software-and-Warranty-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Software and Warranty Review" width="735" height="550" /></p>
<p>Along with Window 10, there are a couple of other apps and games as well that come pre-installed. These include the Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Friends Saga, Cooking Fever, Township, Royal Revolt 2, Fitbit Coach, Photastic Collage, ACG player and Amazon. All these apps can be uninstalled, so it&#8217;s not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The laptop also comes with a free year of Office 365 and the Acer Product registration app which you will need to register your device, check the warranty and get customer support.<br />

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 is a netbook with the dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM, so I did not have high hopes when testing the device and it seems that I was right for the most part. The 4 GB of RAM is a major limitation, and it took only four Chrome tabs to get the device to slow down. With eight tabs open in Chrome and one of them playing a YouTube video, there was a noticeable lag when typing.</p>
<p>While this is not a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming machine</a>, we did play Asphalt 9 on the device, and it ran well. There was no noticeable lag, but then again, the game is very well optimized and will even run on smartphones. We also tried Cooking Fever that came pre-installed, and that ran fine as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Real-Life-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Real Life Performance" width="527" height="700" /></p>
<p>As far as thermals are concerned, the device’s bottom does get a bit warm even while normal multi-tasking possibly because of its fanless design. It can be problematic for users like me who like to use the laptop by keeping it on the lap. However, it was completely usable when kept on the table, and its keyboard and palm rest area didn’t show any signs of heat which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Acer Aspire 1 isn&#8217;t great when it comes to multitasking and although it will run games found on the official store just fine, you cannot expect to play games on it. Opening multiple apps or even Chrome tabs will slow it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>Recommended: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The claimed battery life of the 2018 Acer Aspire 1 is around 6.5 hours, and in our tests, it managed to last for 7 hours and 12 minutes which is decent, but there are options in the market that will give you 8-9 hours of battery backup. That is a factor worth considering if you are someone who has to rely a lot on battery power every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laptop took 2 hours and 17 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% which is also a little longer than the other laptops. So, the battery on the Acer Aspire 1 takes its time to charge and does not offer much in terms of battery life either.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Under $200 &#8211; Our Most Recommended Inexpensive Laptops</a></strong></em> </div></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Laptop-Review-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Laptop Review - Featured Image" width="650" height="483" /></p>
<p>One of the strongest points of the Acer Aspire 1 is its 14-inch full HD display which makes hard to find a substitute for this laptop. Moreover, it offers plenty of ports and comes with modern wireless connectivity options so that you can take advantage of high-speed internet and connect your wireless devices. Although its speakers lack in clarity and have an awful webcam, one cannot go wrong with it considering it costs just $250.</p>
<p>So, overall the Acer Aspire 1 is a solid laptop for the price if you consume content online or work with documents. It can handle some mobile games that are available on the Microsoft store and is a well-built machine overall. The storage and RAM are the limiting factors, but if all you need is a device on which you can create documents, browse the web and watch movies, then this is one of the best inexpensive laptops right now that will get the job done.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes in a polycarbonate chassis and is cladded in a charcoal-grey exterior. The laptop comes with a brushed metal finish, which adds to the premium factor for the laptop. It is thin, compact, portable, and comes with a beautiful tactile finish. Thanks to its texture and form-factor, the laptop offers good grip to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3052 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-14-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14 Inch Laptop - Design" width="650" height="324" /></p>
<p>The laptop weighs just around 3.6 pounds and measures 13.5 x 9.65 x 0.71 inches, which is now a standard for these <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inchers</a>. The screen is surrounded by thick bezels in a matte-black bezel, and rubber cladding covering all sides. All the ports and connectors are neatly recessed at either side of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop features a 180-degree hinge, so the keyboard and screen can lay flat together. This feature makes it an ideal choice for a group of kids to huddle around a desk and allows the users to adjust the screen to whatever level, they are most comfortable with.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3053 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop Keyboard" width="600" height="375" /></p>
<p>On a conclusive note about the design and finish of the Aspire 1, although the laptop doesn’t offer a lot of fancy flairs, it certainly ticks all the design essentials including built quality, finish, grip, and portability.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2017 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Laptops for College Students of 2017</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 14-inch Full HD display, which is a rare scene for a <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $300</a>. It comes with a widescreen display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Considering the specifications, the laptop is unarguably a great bargain for the price. Now let’s speak about its real-time performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3054 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Full-HD-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Full HD Display" width="800" height="596" /></p>
<p>The device comes with a very crisp and sharp display panel, which offers adequate colors with precision. During our review, we extensively used the laptop to watch high definition content and 4K content. When I viewed the aforementioned content, I noticed that although the blacks on the screen were slightly dull and less punchy, it was able to reproduce good color gamut, which we hardly see in a laptop at this price.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Although the design is one of the strong points of the Acer Aspire 1, the hardware and specifications are yet another unique selling point of this laptop. It sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-Core Processor which can throttle up to 2.2GHz. The processor is paired with a 4GB of RAM to handle multitasking and applications on the device. The device comes with a mere 32GB of onboard storage, which <strong>cannot</strong> be, however, further expanded by putting a bigger SSD or HDD.</p>
<p>Graphics on the laptop are handled by the CPU&#8217;s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU, which although isn’t meant to handle high-end games, can still take on moderate graphics with ease. Other specifications of the device include connectivity options such as 802.11ac WiFi featuring MIMO technology. It also sports a dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz to boost up the connectivity speeds.</p>
<p>Considering the price point at which the laptop is being sold, trading-off with some hardware feels absolutely fine. As long as your expectations are in check, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop will not disappoint you.<br />

<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop comes with a VGA front facing webcam, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. The maximum resolution of the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 is 640&#215;480  pixels. The images captured on the camera felt slightly underwhelming and turned out grainy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2875 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Acer-Aspire-1-14-inch-full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14-inch full HD Laptop" width="550" height="312" /></p>
<p>The video calls on the laptop were serviceable. On a conclusive note, the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 doesn’t come with anything worth mentioning but it certainly does the basics well.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 offers a long list of connectivity options and ports. All the ports and connectivity slots on this laptop are equally distributed on its either sides. Accordingly, it sports 1 USB 3.0 Port, a HDMI port with HDCP support, and an SD card reader on its left edge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3056 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Ports and Slots" width="1000" height="307" /></p>
<p>Whereas the right corner of the laptop contains 2 USB 2.0 ports and a 3.5mm Audio Jack.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer preloads the Aspire 1 with the Windows 10 Home variant and with just a handful of utilities that makes the laptop free from unnecessary bloatware. The laptop also comes with some of the Acer’s proprietary software and tools including the Acer Care Center, which monitors the system health and provides the information about the software updates.</p>
<p>Like in most of the latest Acer laptops, The Aspire 1’s Power Button comes with a customisable option to perform multiple options. And all these options can be customised and easily set through the Windows 10 control panel. Speaking about the Acer Quick Access, the software allows you to quickly enable or disable the blue light-reduction mode and aids in setting up a quick hotspot.</p>
<p>Apart from them, the laptop comes with a standard load of casual games, tools, and trialware. On a conclusive note, the laptop does offer a sturdy and well-rounded software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Top 10 Best Laptops Under $200</strong></em></a></div></div>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 as mentioned above comes with a decent set of specifications. However, specifications alone cannot predict the regular daily usage. The laptop takes about 10-12 seconds to boot the Windows 10, which is rather slow. All the apps take a while to load and heavy applications such as the Chrome might take another 5-10 seconds to show up. Thankfully, the RAM management on the device seems to work just fine and multi-tasking was good and smooth.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, we pushed it to its complete throttle and threw a hard set of applications and requests simultaneously. The laptop to our surprise did pretty well, and was able to handle most of the tasks well.</p>
<p>As far as the benchmarks are concerned, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop performs well in numbers considering the specifications. We managed to get a handsome 2044 and 2100 points in PCMark 8, which are very commendable considering the processor. While the number always doesn’t reflect the performance, all we can say is, we were pretty satisfied with the overall performance of the Aspire 1.</p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming capabilities of this budget-friendly notebook, it is provided with the Intel’s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU. Do note that, the laptop doesn’t come with any other additional graphics processor and is, therefore, not an ideal machine, if you&#8217;re looking for a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming-stationed laptop</a>. Although it is capable of rendering decent graphics and pictures in the videos and lighter games, it simply cannot run high-end games.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a pair of built-in stereo speakers, which are neither weak nor are groundbreaking. That said, the speakers are powerful enough to pump up an audio experience in a small room. The speakers are capable of providing clear and distortion free audio output.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3057" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Speakers-and-Audio-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Speakers and Audio Quality" width="700" height="392" /></p>
<p>We played some HD, Full HD, and 4K content on this laptop, to which it responded well. Thanks to its full HD display, the colors were well reproduced and we had a good time using the laptop as a source of entertainment and multimedia.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 2-cell Li-Ion Battery of 4810 mAh. The laptop being provided with the right set of hardware and features, it provides a very impressive battery backup of up to 9 hours of continuous usage.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, it did provide exceptionally good backup and was able to provide a screen on time of over 8 hours on one full charge. The laptop gets fully charged in just under 2 hours 30 minutes, which we feel is pretty ideal. It is worth noting that, the laptop doesn’t get warm even while charging and using it simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3049" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/acer-aspire-1-a114-31-c4hh-laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop" width="500" height="310" /></p>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 is a mixed bag. That said, there are aspects which makes it tough to believe that it’s a laptop priced at around $200. While, on the other hand, few aspects of the laptop really disappoints, especially, the non-expendable internal storage. Considering every aspect of the laptop, it is quite evident by now that the Acer Aspire 1 is a very affordable and an excellent value for money notebook. For those, who are tight on budget, but wants to stay productive through the versatility of a laptop, then it’s undeniable that there is no better substitute for the Acer Aspire 1, in its segment.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, almost all the ultrabooks these days looks akin to the Apple’s very own <a title="Checkout All MacBooks on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2kPOuqp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBooks</a> in terms of the overall form-factor and design. And the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 laptop is no exception in this case as well. There are a lot of similarities in the design of the ZenBook UX330UA and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple MacBook Air</a>. They are almost identical in size and weight and shares similar design hues, including chunkier bezels around the display, curved panel along the edges, and keyboard’s layout.</p>

<div id="attachment_2025" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2025" class="size-full wp-image-2025" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Laptop Design" width="513" height="600" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg 513w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-257x300.jpg 257w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-43x50.jpg 43w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Solid Aluminum Build</strong></p></div>
<p>Here come the other design aspects, which are not like the MacBook. The metal borders around the display are chunky and come with a large protective layer, which although looks a little awkward, but adds up to the protection of the device. The overall premium metallic shiny outer bezels on the laptop are through a layer of tiny metallic particles, on top of premium aerospace-grade aluminium, making it quite different from that of an all-metallic chassis of a MacBook.</p>

<p>Speaking about the sides of the laptop, there are all types of ports and connectivity slots included on both sides of the laptop. We will discuss on ports and slots in more depth later in this review. On an overall note, the ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 certainly looks a lot better than most of its rivals in the segment and is surely an eye-catcher in terms of the overall design.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook sports a 13.3-inch wide-view anti-glare display protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. The display on the laptop is a LED matte panel which comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The display on the laptop is also bolstered by the IPS technology, known for providing clear and vivid display quality. The display on the laptop is a wide viewing angle which covers up to 178 degrees, for better viewing. The laptop offers a colour gamut of 72%, which is on par with most of the current display panels in this budget.</p>

<p>Moreover, during our usage, we never felt eye strains even after very prolonged usage, which is a very good aspect of this laptop. We also ran few benchmarks on the ZenBook and were surprised to look at how well the laptop’s display fares in real-time usage. In terms of brightness, the laptop offers 420 nits, which is adequate and bright even under direct sunlight. We noticed that blacks on the screen to be very accurate and punchy, which gives it the right depth of colour and image on the display.</p>

<p>All in all, the display on the Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 is really a strong point for the laptop.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware and configuration the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 offers, under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor, which comes with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz. However, the laptop can be rattled under its full potential of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. For application handling and multitasking, the laptop is provided with an 8GB of DDR3 RAM, which we felt to be a little outdated, considering its rivals having a DDR4 enabled RAMs. However, it&#8217;s the perfect blend of processor and RAM on this laptop, which didn&#8217;t let us down throughout our usage.</p>

<p>As far as the storage on this laptop concerned, it comes with a 256GB of SSD storage, which should suffice most of your data. The laptop comes with a fingerprint scanner, which is a unique feature in laptops. This not only adds up to the versatility of the laptop but also ensures safety and security of the user’s privacy. For the gaming and graphics related niches, the laptop comes with the latest integrated Intel HD 620 Graphics, which although isn&#8217;t as powerful as Nvidia but is surely capable of handling most of the daily graphic related usage.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook comes with an HD webcam and the camera on the laptop is strictly average. Even under bright lighting conditions, we felt the image on the display was blurry and murky. However, the camera is quick at adjusting the image on the display and is, therefore, manageable for occasional video calls.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being an ultrabook, the Asus Zenbook UX330UA doesn&#8217;t compromise on any connectivity options. Most importantly, it sports a 3.5mm audio jack which many laptop manufacturers are planning to get rid of.</p>

<p>The laptop offers two USB 3.0 ports for faster, efficient, and reliable file transfers and a <a title="USB Type-C Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USB Type-C port</a> to deliver up to 10 times faster data transfers. In addition to them, this laptop also comes with a USB Charger+, a Micro-HDMI port, and a Micro-SD card slot.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Ultra-Slim Laptop runs Windows 10 home out-of-the-box. The software on the laptop works just fine as that of any other laptop running Windows 10. The software on the laptop is productive, efficient, fast, and reliable but has its own drawbacks. The laptop is stuffed with some bloatware, which we felt was quite unnecessary for most of the users.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the ZenBook comes stuffed with a latest seventh gen intel core i5 processor paired with an 8GB of RAM. This duo is now commonly seen on most of the latest laptops at this budget. Although these specifications are any groundbreaking, they certainly offer very reliable and stable overall performance. The RAM and system memory is very well managed in this ultrabook.</p>
<p>During our usage, we&#8217;ve put the laptop to its full potential. We ran multiple RAM and processing power consuming benchmarking apps to which the laptop responded really well. Switching between apps, multitasking, gesture support, and other essential performance aspects on this laptop are pretty convincing. During our entire usage, we hardly noticed a performance issues. In fact, we loved how the laptop responded to the heavy applications.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Speaking about the gaming aspect of the laptop, it comes with an integrated Intel HD 620 graphics, which is one of the most advanced graphics integrated with an Intel chipset. The graphic reproduction and handling of the laptop are pretty neat and tidy. Although one cannot expect a powerful gaming experience on this laptop, almost all the modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook 3 is unarguably a multimedia-stationed laptop. This aforementioned statement is bolstered by its powerful Harman Kardon audio paired with ASUS’s proprietary Golden Ear team to produce an unmatched and unsurpassed distortion-free sound. The laptop comes with the SonicMaster technology for tuning audio and sports a 4-Channel, 5-magnet enabled, Quad-Speakers for a powerful audio experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, the laptop also comes with a smart-Amp audio technology option, which lets you setup the audio as per the user’s choice. Speaking about the video playback abilities, the laptop can play 4K content with ease, and thanks to its super wide viewing angles, watching videos on this laptop is a pleasure.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Speaking about battery life of the ASUS ZenBook, the laptop is fuelled with a 57 Wh polymer battery pack. The battery packed in the laptop is pretty much sufficient to provide a backup of around 5-10 hours based on the usage. The laptop can be fully charged in around 2 hours 30 minutes. During our review, the laptop survived for 8 hours in video playback test, where we played 4k content with around 40% of brightness. Do note that, these figures can increase or decrease based on the usage. On a conclusive note, the battery could have been much better for a laptop this calibre as the MacBook Air with the almost similar set of configuration lasts at least 3 hours more than our current contender.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1932" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54-Best-Ultrabook-Under-$700" width="550" height="320" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-300x175.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-515x300.jpg 515w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />With all that said, we’d like to conclude saying that the ASUS ZenBook is undoubtedly one of the most polished and performance-oriented laptops in the segment. The laptop has few weaker zones, but thankfully, it also has a lot of other aspects which are very well-tuned making it an able <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contender in around a budget of $700</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for an eye-catchy premium looking daily performer, then the ASUS ZenBook is surely a worth considering option. Also note that there are hardly any able laptops in this price range and you&#8217;ll need to spend few hundreds additionally to get a better option such as Dell XPS 13, or the MacBook Air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Chromebooks are probably the most renowned and well-known series of chromebooks across the globe. That said, since the inception of Chrome OS, very few brands started endorsing it and made this OS available in their machines. Acer is one among those aforementioned rare brands, who took the step further and brought a powerful lineup of Chromebooks to the audience. Moreover, the brand has also made sure that they will be available for all the price segments and have thus launched various models starting at as low as $160.</p>
<p>Although all the models, didn&#8217;t quite excelled in their segments, there are few Chromebooks, which established a firm market share and are currently one of the best sellers globally. Today, we are going to make you familiar with one of the most compact, efficient, and a complete value for money Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook 11 (CB3-131-C3SZ). We had quite a long and good time spending with this laptop, and here is our full review of it:<span id="more-1766"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Although the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ is the cheapest chromebook available in the market, it does a pretty good job in offering a clean and polished exteriors. The laptop comes with a white case, which although looks neat and clean feels cheap. During our usage, we also felt that the laptop was hollow in certain areas from the chassis. One thing which is admirable in the laptop is its ruggedness. The chassis of the laptop doesn&#8217;t attract any smudges or scratches on it. On an overall note, the Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ is quite good for the asking price. Do note that you&#8217;re getting this laptop at the price of a toy. Uh, a costly toy maybe.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1828 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Laptop Design" width="750" height="532" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-300x213.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-610x433.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-600x426.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />The Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ comes with a standard chuckle keyboard. Key alignment and the keypad’s placement is largely similar to that of all other chromebooks. The keys are clear, visible, and are unfortunately not backlit enabled. The keyboard comes with good mechanics and all the keys offer good tactile feedback. Using TypingTest.com, I managed to score around 92 words per minute with six errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my MacBook Air. All that said, the laptop does offer a great keyboard for the asking price.</p>

<p>As far as the touchpad on this laptop is concerned, it is nice and spacious and works well with multitouch gestures as well. The laptop offers gestures including—touch to click, double touch to right-click, swipe with three fingers to switch between apps and much more based on the customisation. But we didn&#8217;t have a pleasant time using the mechanical click buttons on the trackpad. During our usage, these mechanical clicks often got stuck, which was annoying.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Coming to the display segment of the laptop, the Acer Chromebook CB3 sports an 11.6-inch HD display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The display is of IPS LED type and comes with the Acer’s proprietary ComfyView Widescreen technology for a better viewing experience. Also, the screen is set to a fixed aspect ratio of 16:9. The matte display on the CB3 gains it an advantage when it comes to providing adequate brightness without hurting eyes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1830" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ Laptop - Display" width="750" height="474" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-300x190.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-610x386.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-600x379.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Not to mention, the laptop is priced under $200. The screen is combined with a laid back wide angles along with the decent amount of brightness and contrast. Matte finish on the display makes it suitable for almost all the indoor usage conditions.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Before we start giving out the specifications and hardware stuff of this Chromebook, we would like the viewers to first recollect the price of this device and proceed down. Under the hood, the laptop packs in a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2840 processor. The laptop is dual-core and with the help of Intel Burst technology, the laptop can achieve a clock speed of 2.58GHz. For multitasking, the Acer Chromebook 11 is equipped with a 2GB of DDR3L RAM, which is although very less when compared to other Windows-based laptops, is quite adequate for Chrome OS.</p>
<p>For graphics, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ ships with an integrated intel graphics processor, which takes care of rendering minor graphics. For storage, it offers a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-expandable</span> 16GB of solid state drive internal storage, which we feel is the major letdown for this budget-friendly Chromebook. However, if you&#8217;re always connected to the internet, then Google is offering free 100GB of online cloud storage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 offers an HD web camera at top of the screen. The camera is pretty fast in adjusting images on the frame. The shot to shot time is also comparatively very less than those in its competitors. The laptop is ideal for Skype or any other video calls due to its compact-sized weight.</p>

There is another USB 2.0 port, which comes quite handy if one requires connecting an additional peripheral. The laptop also comes with an HDMI port with HDCP port for wired media sharing.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ runs on the Google’s proprietary Chrome OS, which is a lightweight operating system for laptops. The OS is well-known for its resource utilisation and can deliver decent performance even under a feeble set of specifications. Accordingly, the CB3 offers a very decent performance for the hardware it packs in.</p>
<p>Although the software on the laptop offers a couple of interesting features such as file viewer, app grid, document editor, and more, there are few segments wherein, the software struggles. During our usage, we clearly felt that the software is not very well polished. However, we hope that it gets fixed with some regular updates. The Acer Chromebook CB3 is one among the <a title="Chrome OS Systems Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very few laptops listed</a> to eventually get access to the Google Play Store. In addition to that, it comes with all the popular Google’s lineup of apps with built-in: Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Hangouts.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>What performance would you expect from a laptop costing $160? That said, we aren&#8217;t demoting this laptop in any manner. It&#8217;s just that the hardware packed in the CB3 is very basic and evidently one cannot expect a class-leading performance from it. A dual-core entry-level mobile processor paired with a 2GB of RAM is although capable of handling basic tasks, it struggles under heavy usage. The best part is, the laptop is fan-less and therefore, doesn&#8217;t produce any sound during usage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Exterior" width="740" height="655" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg 740w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-300x266.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-610x540.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-600x531.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-50x44.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" />All the daily essentials such as browsing internet, handling text editors and readers runs fine without any considerable lag in them. In fact, we were quite amused from the performance and apps handling in the CB3. The laptop is pretty fast and quick when compared to the Windows counterpart. The Chrome OS is a great add-on for this entry-level laptop as there are not many background applications and services in Chrome OS as compared to a Windows OS.</p>

<p>On the connectivity front, the laptop supports a dual band 802.11ac WiFi featuring the company’s proprietary MIMO technology for faster network reception.</p>
<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, the laptop does quite good in handling graphics. Especially, considering the basic integrated graphics on the device. We ran few games such as tank rider and speed racer games, which although are light on graphics are quite entertaining. To our surprise, the laptop handled them all without any kind of lags or hiccups.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with two built-in stereo speakers which support high definition audio. We tried playing high definition FLAC files, for which the laptop did pretty well. The sound output is although not very loud, the audio produced is easily sufficient to fill a small sized room. We also tried playing some Full HD and 2K video content on the chromebook 11, for which the laptop did really well. Sadly, the laptop struggled a lot to handle 4K content.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ stays pumped up using a 36 watt-hour battery, which is quite average considering the specifications. However, Acer did really well to squeeze a little more from the battery. Even during our usage, the laptop managed to deliver about 8 hours of continuous usage, which included watching videos running few basic benchmarks and browsing. During all the time, the WiFi was enabled. Therefore, we expect the laptop to deliver a little more of battery backup when the network reception is disabled. The laptop can be fully charged in less than 2 hours which is great.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11" width="750" height="560" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-300x224.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-610x455.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-600x448.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />On an overall note, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6-Inch Laptop is a complete value for money offering from Acer. The laptop not only managed to impress us, but also amazed us with some aspects such as battery life and performance. Assuming, you&#8217;re looking for a compact, value for money, and a browsing focussed laptop, then the Chromebook 11 must definitely be in your wish list.</p>
<p>At the asking price, there are hardly any competitors for the laptop. Not to mention the Chrome OS is a perfect supplement for the hardware the laptop packs in.</p>
