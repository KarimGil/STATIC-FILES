										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, you must have learned about <a title="HP gives a boost to their Elite 800 notebooks with SureSense and advanced privacy features" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/hp-gives-boost-elite-800-notebooks-suresense-advanced-privacy-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP&#8217;s Elitebook upgrades</a> but that&#8217;s not all HP is up to. Their already top of the line business machines the ZBooks are now powered with even improved hardware and endowed with high build quality.</p>
<p>The new upgrades involve the 14U and 15U G6 workstations, named for their 14 and 15.6-inch screen sizes. But that is the only major difference between them. The insides are assembled with eighth-generation Intel CPU with tons of variants to choose from. Starting at the Core i5-8265U, and going all the way up to the i7-8665U. Storage options go from 128GB to 2TB of SSD while you can configure the machines with 32GB of DDR4 memory, an AMD WX 3200 graphics if you are in pursuit of 3D rendering.</p>
<p>Now all this might not be packed in the exterior that you imagine but trust me, do not let the skinny frame fool you. Their contemporary aluminium chassis can withstand much more than traditional &#8216;durable&#8217; machines. HP has managed to make these brawny enough to pass 19 MIL-STD tests so the professional users do not have to worry about travelling with them in unpleasant weather conditions. However, their gauntness did take a toll on the port selection. You will only find a USB 3.0 port, an RJ-45 Ethernet input, a Thunderbolt port, an HDMI and headphone jack in the selection. HP also sacrificed the U-Series Intel chips for H-series which might not be able to live up to the typical workstation laptop performance. But let&#8217;s hope that the Core-i7 processors and the extensive storage make up for the shortfall.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>An exciting upgrade is the 4K screen option, offering remarkable 400 nits of brightness. You can also take things up a notch with 1080p screen alternatives and a variety of other options including protective glass anti-glare coatings, and touch support. The 14U and 15U are packed with 50-watt-hour and 56-watt-hour batteries respectively, delivering up to 14 hours per charge. This might not seem as impressive to business professionals for a mobile workstation but the fast charging feature offers a ray of hope. And yes, HP has made sure to add Sure View in Zbooks as well to block out unwanted eyes and prying co-workers.</p>
<p>Weighing just a litter under 4 pounds, the Zbooks aren&#8217;t really breaking barriers in the &#8216;lightweight&#8217; area but specs like Wi-Fi 6, LTE advanced and Bluetooth kind of takes the attention away from its minor shortcomings.</p>
<p>HP is yet to disclose the price of these workstation ultrabooks but we&#8217;ll sure know it before May 27 which is when the devices will be available for purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when we thought HP couldn&#8217;t have made their ZBook line of mobile workstations more powerful, they go on and throw in the 8th generation Intel Core i9 processors in the mix.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s new in the mix?</h3>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long ago when HP bumped up their Zbook lineup. The laptops have now gotten a major boost and will now come built in with the Core i9 hexa core processor, Nvidia Quadro P2000 graphics and of course an increased RAM.</p>
<p>Four of its ZBook PCs: the ZBook Studio and the ZBook Studio x360, along with the ZBook 15 and 17 have received the upgrade. But they are still available with Core i5, Core i7 and Xeon options along with Intel&#8217;s latest innovation processors.</p>
<div id="attachment_4339" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4339" class="wp-image-4339 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HP-ZBook-Studio-x360.jpg" alt="HP ZBook Studio x360" width="700" height="467" /><p id="caption-attachment-4339" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; HP</p></div>
<p>Interestingly enough, HP doesn&#8217;t plan to stop here. The upgraded ZBook models also feature RAID 1 storage. This means that you can now have two solid state drives with the same data mirrored on both. This is a stellar feature for maintaining backups as you can always count on the other one in case the first drive fails.</p>
<p>Moreover, HP has rewarded both ZBook Studio and the ZBook Studio x360 with support for up to a 4K display and up to 32GB of RAM. The bendable x360 convertible model will also be equipped with an anti-glare touchscreen. This addition has made the display even brighter while also cutting down on glare.</p>
<p>HP claims for the improved display to be</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;20 percent brighter than the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch Retina display and 50 percent brighter than the Dell XPS UltraSharp 4K display.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like HP wants to make these two devices outshine in terms of graphics performance and display and market the notebooks&#8217; to better handle heavy workloads such as 3D rendering&#8217;.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <strong>ZBook 15</strong> and <strong>ZBook 17</strong> laptops are getting their RAM upped with up to 128GB now.</p>
<p>According to Xavier Garcia, VP and general manager of Z by HP &#8211; they listened to the needs of creative pros who need to</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;increase their productivity and create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>All four refreshed HP ZBook notebooks are <a href="http://tidd.ly/3fd4d188" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available now</a> on  HP&#8217;s website.  The ZBook 15, 17, and Studio are available starting at $1,349 (the 128GB RAM option available starting from December), while the ZBook Studio x360 causing a slightly more damage with the starting price of $1,499.</p>
<h3>The Z Club Subscription</h3>
<p>For creative professionals, HP has decided to introduce a  hardware subscription program along with a fresh plugin for Adobe Illustrator CC.</p>
<p>The Z Club, will act as what HP calls it &#8220;an exclusive program for elite creators to upgrade their studios.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="no-amazon"><p>A group of 100 creative professionals will be selected as initial members and will be outfitted with custom-made photographer, video editor, graphic designer or artist bundles.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bundle will include not just PCs, but also displays, printers, accessories and applications, which is a banging way to make a first impression with the remodel.</p>
<p>The subscription scheme allows creators to enjoy their bundles for three months free of charge. After the trial period, the subscribers can either choose to pay for the monthly subscription package or send the contraptions back free of charge. HP is yet to reveal the costing specifications of their monthly package.</p>
<p>If you would like to try out your luck and be one of the 100s, subscribe away on <a href="http://tidd.ly/c743f06d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
