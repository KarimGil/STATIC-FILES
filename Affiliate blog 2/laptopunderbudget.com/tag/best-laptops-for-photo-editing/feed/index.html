										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of Course, photographers need a camera to take pictures, but after taking pictures, they need a laptop using which they can see those captured images on a bigger display, color correct the raw files, and finalize the shots. Therefore, the laptop is the second most important thing in a photographer’s life after their beloved cameras. And just like cameras, buying the best laptop for photographers is also no less than a herculean task. There are a lot of things to check in a laptop for photo editing, and people often make mistakes in choosing the right one. So, what are the important things to check on a photographer’s laptop? And, what are the best laptops available in the market for photo editing? Let’s find them out…<br />
<span id="more-1685"></span></p>
<p>Most photographers have an initial thought of buying a desktop instead of the laptop for photo editing, and we also know that many of you are still confused about making the right choice between them. So, let us begin by discussing this in a little context to help you decide whether desktops or laptops are good for photo editing.</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-outline vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Desktops vs Laptops: What is&nbsp;best for Photo Editing?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Both laptops and desktops have their pros and cons. So, what&#8217;s best for you depends on your profession and your working style &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re a traveling photographer then definitely the choice for you would be the laptop as traveling with the desktop is not possible. Hence, you will need a lightweight and powerful laptop to view and edit your captured photos on the go.</li>
<li>Whereas, if you are a designer or have to work from a fixed place, then I would recommend you to buy the desktop for your photo editing works because desktops are cheaper, &#8220;more powerful&#8221; and also easy to upgrade than laptops.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Don't get me wrong,</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"></p>
<p>Laptops are also powerful, but the processors inside the laptops are mobile variants, so they are clocked to work at lower speeds to deliver better battery backup. However, this isn&#8217;t a problem with <a title="Intel Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by newer generation processors</a> because newer generation mobile processors significantly reduce that&nbsp;performance gap between desktops and laptops.</p>
<p>Even the newer mobile GPUs are powerful enough to easily carry out intensive photo editing work on laptops using softwares like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.</p>
<p></div></div>
<p>So,&nbsp;buying a laptop&nbsp;for photo editing isn&#8217;t a bad choice at all, but the only thing you need to know is, you will trade in a little performance for the portability you get in the&nbsp;laptop. Whereas, desktops are best at delivering raw performance.</p>
</div>

<p>Now it&#8217;s totally up to you as you know what&#8217;s right for you and what isn&#8217;t. So, if you opted for a desktop then probably we should say each other a goodbye because we are not going to talk about desktops here.</p>

</ul>
<p>Well, if you have decided to buy a laptop for your photo editing works, then there are a lot of crucial things to check in the laptop which will be specifically used for running intensive photo editing softwares like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.</p>
<p>So, before we proceed with the list of best laptops for photo editing, let&#8217;s discuss all the important things to check in the laptop for photographers and photo editing works.</p>

	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Important Things to Check in the&nbsp;Laptop for Photographers and Photo Editing</h3>
<hr>
<p>We do have&nbsp;our expert&#8217;s recommended best&nbsp;laptops for photo editing listed below which will not require you to check anything, but if you opt to buy any laptop which is not&nbsp;in our list below then make sure&nbsp;to check these things in the laptop to make it a perfect buy for photo editing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel i5 or i7 Processor &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;The CPU plays a vital role in deciding the overall performance of any computer. And, for running power demanding softwares like Photoshop you&#8217;ll need a powerful CPU. We recommend you to get the <a title="Best i5 Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop with newer generation Intel i5</a> or <a title="Best i7 Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">i7 processor</a>. The <a title="Best i3 Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by Intel Core i3 processor</a> can also work well if you are a beginner in this field, but for future proofing it is better to invest in a laptop with Intel Core i5 processor.</li>
<li><strong>At least 8GB of RAM &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>As a professional photo editor or photographer, you&#8217;ll be working with multiple files and programs simultaneously. So, to make sure that your laptop always runs smoothly while editing photos, we recommend at least 8GB of RAM in the laptop for photo editing. Also, check for the extra RAM slots so that if required you can increase the RAM of your laptop in the future.</li>
<li><strong>256GB or more &#8220;SSD&#8221; Storage &#8211;</strong> As a photographer, you&#8217;ll click a lot of pictures from your DSLR camera and the average size of each image captured from DSLR cameras is about 15MB, so you will need a lot of storage space to store all of them. You can buy a laptop with 1TB of hard drive which will allow you to save all your photos on the laptop, but we recommend you to buy a laptop with SSD. Get the laptop with a 256GB or if your budget allows 512GB SSD and buy an external hard drive to keep the backup of the images you&#8217;ve completed editing. We recommend SSD because SSDs are faster than hard drives and it also improves the overall performance of the laptop.</li>
<li><strong>2GB or More Dedicated Graphics &#8211;&nbsp;</strong> These days we don&#8217;t need the dedicated graphics card in a laptop for photo editing because integrated graphics on newer processors can also handle intensive softwares without any problems, but we recommend to have at least 2GB of dedicated graphics because it will help while editing high-resolution photos. However, if you have to deal with extremely high-resolution images and also some video editing work occasionally, then we would recommend you to get a better graphics backed laptop. Nvidia&#8217;s MX250 GPU is great for mediocre photo editing work, but for high-resolution photos and video editing, we recommend Nvidia&#8217;s GTX and RTX line of GPUs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full HD Display with Good&nbsp;Color Accuracy &#8211;</strong> Last but not least, the display of the laptop for photo editing should be bright and the one that displays accurate colors (check sRGB rating). We recommend display with full HD resolution (i.e. 1920 x 1080) for normal editing work, but if you have to edit very high resolution images then you&#8217;ll need a laptop with 4K display (i.e. 3840 x 2160) for editing such photos.</li>
</ul>

<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#000000;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">PRO TIP</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px">Editing photos using the trackpad on laptops or with the mouse might not be the best experience.</p>
<p>Most professionals use the graphics tablets with pens for drawing and photo editing works. Graphics tablets when connected with the laptops give a whole new experience for designers and professional photographers because those tablets come with pressure sensitivity which gives more precision and accuracy in photo editing softwares such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.</p>
<p>So, in case if you&#8217;re looking for best graphics tablet for yourself, then you can check out our guide to buy the <a title="The Best Tablets for Photoshop – Our Top Picks for Best Photo-Editing Tablets" href="https://tabletunderbudget.com/photo-editing-tablets-for-photoshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best tablets for photo editing</a> on our sister site <em>&#8216;Tablet Under Budget&#8217;</em>.</div></div>

<h3>4. LG Gram 17 <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Large Screen Option</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3bgsM9j" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-Gram-17.jpg" alt="LG Gram 17 - best large screen laptop for photo editing" width="550" height="416"></a></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t want to miss the standard PC feel, the LG Gram 17 is a perfect option. It comes with a large <strong>17-inch IPS display with 114% of color gamut</strong> and powerful hardware which makes it the best 17-inch laptop for photo editing right now. Its chassis is made from the special metal alloy and it complies with the 810G Military Standard so it is perfect for photographers who travels a lot and has to edit pictures on-the-go. Moreover, it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world&#8217;s lightest 17-inch laptop</span> weighing in at just 2.9 pounds, so you won&#8217;t be lugging this laptop around like other 17-inch laptops.</p>
<p>The colorful display and portable chassis isn&#8217;t all the laptop has got. It also comes with an equally tempting set of powerful configuration making it a very good laptop for photoshop. With its powerful Intel Core i7 processor paired up with a massive 16GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD, the LG Gram 17 laptop can handle quite a lot of tasks with ease.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about the price tag, the laptop costs around $1800 and for the price it offers an excellent package overall, but it comes with Intel&#8217;s integrated Iris Plus graphics. That said, it can still handle all sorts of photo editing work on Photoshop or Lightroom without any problems, but it would struggle if you would try to edit videos on it. So, if you are looking for a large screen laptop solely for photo editing only, then LG Gram 17 is probably the best option right now.</p>

<h3>5. Apple MacBook Pro 16 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best MacBook for Photo Editing</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_5926" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://amzn.to/2S8bfZG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5926" class="wp-image-5926 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Apple-MacBook-Pro-16.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16 - Best Laptop for Professional Photographers" width="550" height="319"></a><p id="caption-attachment-5926" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Best Compact and High-end Laptop for Professional Photographers</strong></p></div>
<p>Have you ever been to a professional photographer or video producer&#8217;s studio? The chances of they using a Mac is way higher than using a Windows-based laptop. That said, Apple’s MacBooks and iMacs are widely used for handling high-end graphics tools for image and video processing. And here is a compact yet, very powerful MacBook Pro 15, which comes with a stunning <strong>16-inch True Tone Retina display with 3072 x 1920 Resolution</strong>.</p>
<p>For the internals, it is powered by the latest generation six-core Intel Core i7 processor paired up with a 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. This not only provides seamless multitasking, but also provides a very fast and reliable storage option. For the graphics, the laptop comes with dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 5300M GPU, which boosts up the graphics handling performance of the laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with an all-metal unibody chassis, which gives it a premium look and feel. Moreover, this MacBook comes with a powerful set of photo and video editing tools including <strong>huge trackpad and the touch bar above the keyboard which aids a lot while editing photos in Photoshop on this laptop</strong>.</p>
<p>However, not everything about the MacBook Pro is praiseworthy. It has just 4 ports, 2 on either side and all of them are Thunderbolt USB Type-C. So, to transfer photos from your camera to the laptop you will need a dongle which isn&#8217;t included in the box. Moreover, its price is also comparatively higher than the similarly specced Windows laptops. That said, the MacBook Pro 15 is still one of the most preferred laptop by professionals because of its performance and reliability.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e54c;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF66;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">If you think you can make it with the small display, then <strong>MacBook Pro 13</strong> is also an excellent pick for photo editing. While it doesn&#8217;t come with dedicated GPU, the integrated Intel Iris graphics 655 on it is also more than enough for photo editing. So, if you want to save a bit and think that you will be fine with a smaller display, then MacBook Pro 13 is also worth checking out. | <a href="https://amzn.to/3bhQ2nn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check price on Amazon</a></div></div>

<h3>6. HP ENVY 13t 4K Laptop <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Value for Money</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2SaVD7v" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4032 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HP-Envy-13t.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13t - best laptop for photoshop with 4K display under 1000" width="584" height="376"></a></p>
<p>The HP Envy 13 is one of our most recommended laptops for photographers who have to edit pictures on the go. The reason behind that is it offers 4K display in a lightweight, streamlined chassis, that too, at an affordable price. While most of the models with 4K display cost more than $1500, with this HP Envy 13, you can get it for around $1000.</p>
<p>It comes with a 13.3-inch 4K touchscreen display which is vivid and crisp looking. Speaking about the specifications of the laptop, it comes with 8th Generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM. Although the processor is slightly old, it is still a competent one. It also features a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU which makes it a very capable performer when it comes to intensive media creation and editing work. Moreover, the laptop comes with a 512GB of SSD, which we think is more than enough for a photographer’s needs.</p>
<p>However, the battery backup of this laptop isn’t that great. It can last up to 5 to 6 hours on a single charge which could fall short if you travel a lot. But on an overall note, this HP Envy 13 laptop still offers excellent value for its price, and it is a complete package for budget buyers who don’t want to compromise on features.</p>

<p>Microsoft Surface Book 2 is a detachable laptop, which on detaching the keyboard functions as a tablet. It comes in two different sizes (13 and 15-inch). Both come with a <strong>PixelSense Pressure Sensitive (267 PPI) display</strong> which supports Surface Pen and Surface Dial accessories.</p>
<p>As far as specifications are concerned, it comes with options to opt for newest 8th Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage. It comes preloaded with Windows 10 out of the box, and it delivers impeccable performance along with comprehensive security. The base models are housed with Intel integrated graphics, but there&#8217;s also an option to opt for <strong>dedicated Nvidia GPU</strong>&nbsp;in higher variants. Hence, the Surface Book 2 is able enough to handle graphics-intensive photo editing applications like Adobe Photoshop &amp; Lightroom with ease.</p>
<p>Speaking about the image editing abilities of this laptop, what makes it unique is not the specifications or form-factor that it offers, but the provision of Surface Pen, which makes it a delight to edit images.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-exterior-design.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 2018 - exterior design" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Our Most Recommended Portable Laptops</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor</a></strong></p>
<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>

<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>
