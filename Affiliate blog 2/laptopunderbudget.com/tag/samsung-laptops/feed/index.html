										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Samsung&#8217;s unimpressive take on their Notebook 9 Pen this year, we pretty much gave up all our hopes for this laptop ever meeting our expectations. Turns out, Samsung&#8217;s new year resolutions for 2019 include reviving their high-end ultrabook by introducing some big changes.</p>
<h3>Bigger Size</h3>
<p>Samsung is going for a couple of variations this time. There is a 15-inch and a 13-inch (both HD LCD displays) option for screen sizes. The 13-inch model of the Notebook weighs 2.5 pounds and the 15-inch going up to 3.4 pounds. Both of these variants are convertibles and they come in a dark-blue aluminum finish. Apart from the bigger size, the 15-inch model has the upper hand from its sibling due to the addition Nvidia GeForce MX150 (2GB) discrete graphics.</p>
<div id="attachment_4795" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4795" class="wp-image-4795" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Samsung-Notebook-9-Pen-2019.jpg" alt="Samsung Notebook 9 Pen 2019" width="550" height="476" /><p id="caption-attachment-4795" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Samsung Notebook 9 Pen &#8211; 2019</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The enlarged bodies of these devices hold 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and Intel 8th generation Core i7 processors. These notebooks are expected to make their debut in CES in January and released sometime in 2019.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor (Newest 8th Gen Models)</a></strong></p>
<h3>Better Battery</h3>
<p>So apparently, the size isn&#8217;t the only thing that is being augmented.  Samsung is claiming for the devices to last up to 15 hours while unplugged from a socket. Both variants include a 54Whr battery but for surety on the battery standup, we can only rely on the benchmarks which will of course come around after the release.</p>
<h3>Upgraded S Pen</h3>
<p>The most hyped inclusion in this package upgrade is the S Pen. <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/for-the-creators-introducing-the-new-samsung-notebook-9-pen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to Samsung</a>, the new S Pen (now in Gold) offers reduced latency and is designed to function exactly as it makes contact with the screen. What&#8217;s even more exciting is that the Pen doesn&#8217;t need to be powered up. To make it more fun, Samsung made the tips interchangeable and the Notebook 9 Pen laptops will include three different tips to choose from. Each delivering a different tactile response according to the user&#8217;s preferences.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not changed is the placement of the S Pen and the size. It remains on the front holster of the chassis and holds the same length as of the 2018 S Pen. But the length would be the least of our concerns if Samsung has gotten around this time from the cheap plastic material their &#8216;high-end&#8217; S Pens are made of.</p>

<p>A few other notable additions include the two USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports (supports charging), and a microSD card slot. Samsung also threw in an audio and mic jack along with a backlit keyboard, facial and fingerprint recognition.</p>
<p>Here are the complete specs of the devices as released by Samsung.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-4790 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Notebook-9-pen-Specs.jpg" alt="" width="793" height="309" />Samsung is yet to disclose the pricing of their new 2019 showstoppers so until they do, keep checking in with us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just weeks after the <a title="Microsoft Surface Pro 6 Matt Black Specs, Insights and Preorder Details" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surface Pro 6</a>, Samsung has just uncovered their improvement on the Galaxy Book &#8211; the Galaxy Book2. Samsung’s with their new Galaxy Book2 is stepping away from their long abiding tradition of <a title="Intel Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel processors</a>. Samsung has managed to come up with a bright, powerful, sleek yet a sensible display that is perky enough to carry around for the entire day.</p>
<h3>In the Book</h3>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s latest notebook as the second-generation device that ditches the Intel hardware Core M3 and Core i5 configuration options for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850. Samsung has improved the advanced system on a chip (SoC) by coupling it with a potent octa-core processor that includes an onboard graphics processor for stellar all-around performance and productivity. But, that’s not all the new Samsung 2-in-1 has to offer.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The way the world works is undergoing an incredible transformation, and users need technology that keeps them connected and ready for anything when they’re out in the world getting things done,” <strong>said Alanna Cotton, Senior Vice President and General Manager at Samsung Electronics America</strong>.</p>
<p>“The Galaxy Book2 brings together Samsung’s hardware and connectivity leadership with innovations from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and Microsoft for a two-in-one that uniquely delivers PC productivity and superior mobility.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The design too has been overhauled. The revamped design is quite similar to the Surface. Nonetheless, the Galaxy Book2 still looks a lot like the swarm of 2-in-1 convertible <a title="The Best Windows Tablets – Our Detailed Buying Guide on Tablets Running on Windows 10" href="https://tabletunderbudget.com/best-windows-tablets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 10 tablets in the market</a>. Samsung claims that the Galaxy Book2 is capable of gigabit-class LTE &#8211; a feature that was an optional addition in the past Books. The X20 LTE modem in the notebook offers 4G connectivity so you&#8217;re always connected to your network data like in your smartphone.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Book 2 is also capable of lasting a &#8220;multi work day&#8221; on a single charge. To be specific, the battery estimate is up to 20 hours if the device is running of the Windows S operating system that it is shipped with. That is a commendable improvement from the 11-hour life of the Galaxy Book. The company however, has decided not to lose the 4GB of built-in RAM but did bump up the default storage from 64GB to a decent 128GB as a default setting.</p>
<p>The Super AMOLED  display&#8217;s resolution is pretty neat too, offering 216 pixels per inch with its 2,160 x 1,440 panel. The Galaxy Book 2 packs a bunch of ports including a microSD card reader, a pair of USB-C,  and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Book2’s speakers include Dolby Atmos support. Just like its flagship phones, Samsung has tuned the sound with the company’s AKG division. You will also find a fingerprint sensor and infrared camera on the back of the device for secure login via Windows Hello. The camera: fine, but for the fingerprint sensor its an awkward enough position.</p>
<h3>Outside the Book</h3>
<p>The addition of the rear kick stand adds convertibility to the Book. That sticking to the current trends, is a must-have these days in notebooks. The Surface Pro-like hinge allows you to angle the 12-inch display on a flat surface. The box comes with an included keyboard that magnetically attaches to the bezel on the bottom, inspired much from the Surface keyboard. The body is more or less the same as the Galaxy Book.</p>
<div id="attachment_4361" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4361" class="wp-image-4361 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-Galaxy-Book2-Stand-mode.jpeg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Book2 Stand mode" width="500" height="525" /><p id="caption-attachment-4361" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Samsung Galaxy Book2 | Image &#8211; <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/announcing-samsung-galaxy-book2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Samsung</a></em></p></div>
<p>Though it does have an additional hinge and a back stand but apart from slimming down the bezels a bit and changing curved corners to square ones, there isn&#8217;t much to be excited about the exterior. Moreover, the new and improved 2-in-1 Book is slightly larger and bulkier as well. But not so much that we wouldn&#8217;t call it portable.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Get the Samsung Galaxy Book2 boxed with an S Pen stylus and keyboard, and it will cost you $999. The launch of the device is expected to be on November 2nd on AT&amp;T, Microsoft, and Samsung’s online stores. Now the Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro and Microsoft’s Surface Pro 6 priced for $799 and $899 respectively, do not come with the included options of a stylus and keyboard cover. So there goes the affordability of these devices.</p>
<p>The overall verdict of tech reviewers has been mostly positive. All of them are pretty ecstatic about testing the 20 hour battery life. We have seen good stand ups from Snapdragon machines in the past and getting out from S mode to Windows 10 is going to be easier than ever. While most of us can vouch for the performance, productivity, and longevity of the device, it&#8217;s a little too soon to comment if the Intel to Snapdragon jump was a wise move for Samsung.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when Samsung unveiled their Chromebook Plus V2 in June earlier this year? While the device was applauded for its affordability, it just couldn&#8217;t live up to the original Chromebook Plus. Well at least according to some users. Maybe Samsung paralleled with this idea and decided to up their Chromebook Plus V2 game up a bit. Turns out that Samsung, in collaboration with Google, has upgraded this Chromebook model to support 4G LTE.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The Chromebook Plus V2 stepped into the shelves with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, Intel Celeron 3965Y processor chip &#8211; faster than the <a title="Samsung Chromebook Plus Review – Play Store finally comes to Chromebooks" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/samsung-chromebook-plus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Plus</a>, a  12.2-inch, 1080p display, 4GB RAM, 32GB of solid-state storage, and a 39Wh battery. So you can see that Chromebook Plus V2 was intended to be the upgraded version of the Chromebook Plus. More so, this device is capable enough to be called premium.</span></p>
<p>Samsung deciding to upgrade their already upgraded version seems like they wanted an edge over the <a title="Google Pixel Slate is finally here and here’s our take on the tablet!" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/google-pixel-slate-features-specs-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Pixel Slate</a>. Which according to tech reviewers is the biggest contender of the Chromebook Plus V2 this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_4323" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-image-4323 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-V2-with-LTE.jpg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE" width="561" height="369" /><p id="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-caption-text">Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE</p></div>
<p>Josh Newman, general manager of Mobile PC Segments, Intel Client Computing Group, said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Samsung’s new Chromebook Plus V2 (LTE) device meets this expectation with style by fusing Samsung design ingenuity and Google’s beloved OS with Intel processors and Intel LTE connectivity.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>What does the 4G LTE do?</h3>
<p>For all you folks who don&#8217;t really grasp the idea of 4G LTE, let me break it down for you. It allows you to stay connected to the internet even if you don&#8217;t have a Wi-Fi connection. The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE or the Chromebook Plus V2 on-the-go is a dream for remote workers and travelers.</p>
<p>A sharp HD display with 300 nits max brightness, an energy-efficient processor, 360-degree hinge, and a stylus with an added 4G LTE feature sound too good to be true. It&#8217;s not all fun and games though. The connectivity feature addition adds a $100 cost to the overall price too. Not quite affordable but wouldn&#8217;t be called too steep either.</p>
<p>The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE be available for $599 when it launches on November 2 at Verizon and Best Buy. Samsung hasn&#8217;t yet revealed which networks this device will supporting but we have good hopes.</p>
<p>Given that the Google Pixel comes with the same price as this 2-in-1 convertible notebook but minus the 4G LTE feature, might not work in Pixel&#8217;s favor. Or maybe the Google Pixel Slate&#8217;s innovative design and sleeker body be enough for Chrome OS lovers to choose it over LTE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop had everyone on the edge with the announcement of its launch. The market did go through a bump with its launch and today standards of laptop cum tablets have evolved drastically. Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible is certainly not the best dual tech gadget to possess but it certainly has led the way to such marvellous development.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus is a first of its generation;&nbsp;as this is the first convertible Chromebook ever made by Samsung and there&#8217;s lot more to talk about it.</p>
<p>The one reason for which the&nbsp;new Chromebook line ups from Samsung have became the subject of talks everywhere is, they now support the Google Play Store. So, just like your Android phone or tablet you can download and have access to millions of apps and games with the convenience of keyboard and touchpad.</p>
<p>Well, there are still few problems that we faced&nbsp;with software on our review unit like stuttering of apps and games in fullscreen but we think that it can be fixed with the quick software update. To get more deeper insight on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus&nbsp;go through our full review&nbsp;below.</p>

The metal top allows the owner to use it in adverse conditions without wear and tear issues. The Samsung Chromebook Plus also has a USB Port and stylus parking space.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2476" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Display-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus - Display" width="600" height="400">The LED-Lit screen with a resolution of 2400X1600 pixels is not so good for a laptop but highly impressive from a tablet’s point of view.

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop has been in news for a long time now, the quality display and the impressive design had people in awe but what about the technical specifications? Are they equally worthy of praises?</p>
<p>This laptop comes with an ARM-based OPI processor, well a lot of you might be thinking, it does not have an <a title="Find best Intel processor laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel processor</a>, must not be good, then let me tell you, ARM based processors work best with the Android Applications. Since Samsung Chromebook is based on Chrome OS and not Windows, ARM-based OPI Processors are the best. These processors are going to facilitate a greater run for applications and also provide eloquent streaming of high-quality videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>While the processor is really good with HD videos, it seems to skip a few frames when processing a 4K video. The Pro version is supposed to have covered such petty issues.</p>
<p>The 4GB of RAM is good enough to power a processor with speed of 2 GHz, one can easily brag about their tablet cum laptop possessing such high processing power.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2477" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Touch-Laptop-Stand-Mode-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop Stand Mode" width="600" height="439">32GB of Flash Storage is something that is going to upset a lot of people and affect their final decision. The storage provided is extremely low in comparison to what other laptops come with but then one can consider 32GB of Flash Storage good enough for a tablet. Also, it is facilitated with the microSD card slot so there&#8217;s always an option to expand the memory.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible has a processor count of 6, which makes it easier for people to launch a good number of apps simultaneously. Designed to support multitasking this chromebook&nbsp;will see people accomplishing a lot of work at the same time.</p>

<h4>Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>With the fastest Bluetooth 4.0 this laptop is designed to send and receive signals at a better speed. 802.11 Wi-Fi is good enough to facilitate easier connection establishment and faster web browsing.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this laptop can process some of the toughest files with great ease. The 4GB of RAM, processor with a speed of 2GHz are designed to process all kind of requests and file quite efficiently. Thanks to the efficient set of hardware for a lightweight OS like Chrome, the Samsung Chromebook Plus provides impeccable performance without much stutter or lag.</p>
<div id="attachment_2478" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Touch-Laptop-Size-1.jpeg" alt="Think Light and Convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus" width="428" height="445"><p id="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>0.51&#8243; Thickness &nbsp;| &nbsp;2.38lbs weight</strong></p></div>
<p>The processor provided with the laptop can house all the sufficient power needed to run most of the applications you throw at it. Moreover, thanks to the browser-based interface of the laptop, multitasking on the laptop is pretty smooth and does the tasks efficiently. In addition to all this said, this convertible laptop remains very quiet even under heavy usage, which is very consoling considering the price, form-factor, and performance of this laptop. The laptop sometimes tend to get slightly warmed up under heavy usage, but we’d like to inform you guys that its just near to negligible. All in all, the Samsung Chromebook Plus offers good overall performance at the budget.</p>
<h4>Touchscreen &amp; Stylus</h4>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2479 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Drawing-with-Samsung-Pen-1.jpeg" alt="Drawing with Samsung Pen" width="650" height="381">The input features provided with this laptop are exceptional, one can use the touchscreen to make the drawings more detailed and videos more intricate. The stylus facilitates easier selection, bookmarking and also screen capturing. The stylus on Samsung phones are already impressive and we are glad that&nbsp;they included the same stylus with same functionalities on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus as well. The touchscreen display on this chromebook is also&nbsp;pressure sensitive so this chromebook can really do wonders with&nbsp;photo editing and graphics designing.</p>

<h3>Operating System</h3>
<p>This laptop makes an exception with the operating system. Not functioning on Windows just like the other contemporaries, this laptop runs on Chrome Operating System, which makes it easier for people to run all the applications they have on their phones on this gadget as well. Chrome OS is going to lead the innovation in this sector, enterprises from all faces of life are now going to concentrate on innovation and come up with really smart and newer versions of operating system.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With the dedicated integrated graphic card, 4GB of RAM and 2 GHz processor speed, users can run all the games they play on their mobile devices. The Chrome OS supports Google Play Stores and all the applications listed on this store. The experience is going to be amazing for everyone who loves games from Google Play Store. One can make the wise use of 4GB of RAM and experience the output.</p>
<p>However, we’d like to add a point here, although the laptop is powerful enough to handle light-weighted games, a Chromebook isn&#8217;t meant for real-time gaming. That said, you could always play internet based flash games or normal arcade games available on Play Store with ease, but games like Asphalt 4 still&nbsp;struggles to run smoothly on this laptop. We think Google still needs to refine Chrome OS a bit for more smoother gaming on Chromebooks.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The audio and video impresses the masses because it supports the varied file formats of audio and video. For its audio performance, we tried playing some high-quality encoded audio Flacs and the laptop to our surprise was handling them with ease. The sound quality was good and decent and was loud enough to cover an entire small room. For the video quality, we tried playing some HD, Full HD, and 4K video content, which also responded really well. The colours reproduced on the screen were accurate and were true to life. All in all, the Samsung&nbsp;Chromebook Plus is also a very good multimedia-stationed convertible device.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life of Samsung Chromebook Plus is quite exceptional, only a handful of laptops provide above 10 hours of&nbsp;battery backup while none of the tablets do. This Laptop cum tablet can stay juiced up to 11 continuous hours so that you never have to worry about carrying your charger again.&nbsp;Apart from that, this chromebook &nbsp;gets fully charged in slightly over 2 hours, which is again a strong point of this laptop. The beauty of Chrome OS based laptops is that, the OS used here is pretty light weight and doesn&#8217;t consume much of the hardware or resources to get the work done, this way, the battery life remains exceptional under everyday usage.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2480" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Laptop-Bottom-Line-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop Review" width="708" height="472">Samsung Chromebook Plus convertible laptop is the undisputed winner when it comes to providing people with an incomparable user experience. The quality audio, video, processing power, long battery life and light weight body are just other reasons why you should bet your money on this laptop. The only thing disappointing about this laptop is the storage space. The 32GB of Flash storage will restrict people from storing their favourite movies and enjoy them when either travelling or stuck at workplace with nothing to do.</p>
