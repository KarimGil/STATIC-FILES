<h4>Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3929" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/acer-predator-helios-300-gaming-laptop-ph315-51-78np.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP)" width="500" height="337" /></p>
<p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 is a step below the best gaming laptops out there. It does, however, lack a good cooling system and doesn’t really provide the best sound experience, but I believe those flaws can easily be overlooked, given its Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 Overclockable Graphics with 6 GB of dedicated GDDR5 VRAM for the best gaming experience you can get on a budget.</p>
<p>The insides include an 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8750H 6-Core Processor (Up to 4.1GHz), 16GB DDR4 RAM and 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD, and a 15.6-inch full HD widescreen LED-backlit IPS display with an impressive <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>144Hz refresh-rate</strong></span> and 300-nit brightness which is something we see only on high-end machines.</p>
<p>To top it all off, you will be getting Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 after each purchase from <a href="https://amzn.to/2SZrUNh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for just <del>$1,299.99</del> $999.99, so grab it while the stock lasts!</p>
<h4>Dell G3 Series Gaming Laptop</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3751" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dell-G3-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell G3 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="550" height="421" /></p>
<p>For making gaming experience spectacular while staying on budget, Dell has outdone themselves. Their G3 Gaming Laptop is one of the greatest laptops out there with the most affordable price. The only thing that has suffered from the reduced price is the display which is mediocre, to say the least. Other than that, the 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8750H Processor provides more than ‘mediocre’ performance, that too coupled with a 16GB 2666MHz DDR4. The 15.6-inch FHD display could have been better, as well as the battery life that if not the worst, isn’t exceptional either.</p>
<p>You can save $220 by getting this amazing machine for <a href="https://amzn.to/2yZjQUA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$879.99 from Amazon</a> now. Another notable budget gaming laptop deal on G3 this Cyber Monday is from <a href="https://deals.dell.com/productdetail/1ve4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dell</a> itself. The Dell G3 gaming laptop with i5-8300H and GTX 1050 is available for just $649 right now.</p>
<h4>ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3780" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Performance" width="550" height="564" /></p>
<p>This is the cheapest addition in our list yet for gaming laptops but the price cut does come with a lot of compromises on its specifications. The affordability does leave our budget gamers with small storage space and stuck with a less than decent display quality. Nonetheless, if you are too tight pocketed with a gaming passion &#8211; this is your go-to laptop.</p>
<p>It is powered by an 8th Generation Intel Core i5-8750H processor and has Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU which will support all the AAA titles but at medium graphics settings. There is a 256GB of SSD, an 8GB DDR4, and to sweeten the deal there is a Call of Duty Black Ops 4 in the package for just <a href="https://amzn.to/2Bx7cxz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$799.99 on Amazon</a> ($200 OFF).</p>
<h4>MSI GV62 8RD-200</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3917" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/MSI-GV62-8RD-200-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GV62 8RD-200 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="550" height="361" /></p>
<p>The MSI GV62 8RD-200 is a light-weight, chic and portable laptop for rookie gamers. I say rookie because it is not VR ready and neither does it provide a steady battery life. Amongst the more affordable gaming laptops, the MSI GV62 8RD-200  comes with a relatively new processor, the Intel 8th Gen Core i5-8300H, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4G GDDR5 and 8GB DDR4 RAM. But the best part is its massive 1TB HDD with Intel Optane Memory (16GB) that gives the cache an over the top boost.</p>
<p>Get it now from <a href="https://amzn.to/2JQcQgI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $799 and save 100 bucks on it this Cyber Monday.</p>
<blockquote><span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">DOORBUSTER DEAL</span>MSI GL63 15&#8243; with 16GB RAM, i7-8750H, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 and 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD for <del>$1,499.99</del> <a href="http://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=2149&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMSI-GL63-Performance-Gaming-Laptop-15-6-Intel-Core-i7-8750-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1060-6G-256GB-SSD-1TB-HDD-16GB-RAM-Windows-10-VR-Ready-Black-GL63639-Fr%2F141201459" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$999.00 at Walmart</a></p></blockquote>
<h4>Gigabyte Aero 15X</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4151" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gigabyte-Aero-15x-Ultra-Slim-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="348" /></p>
<p>The first look over the GIGABYTE Aero 15X can pretty easily incite a well earned WOW from any user. The slimmest bezels and the wide display can get anyone’s ball rolling and it’s not even plastic. A full aluminum finish with an elegant appearance, comes with an impeccable battery life that lasts up to 8.5 hours and a good 12 hours under minimal graphics and display settings.</p>
<p>The cooling system on the machine could use a little improvement but other than that, Intel Core i7-8750H (2.2GHz-4.1GHz) processor, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU, and 16 GB DDR4 easily classify this machine amongst premium gaming laptops. You can get this excellent gaming and &#8220;content creation&#8221; laptop now for just <a href="https://amzn.to/2RMdHls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,899 at Amazon</a> which is a whopping $400 discount on its list price.</p>
<blockquote><p>ASUS ROG Zephyrus S Ultra Slim Gaming Laptop with 15.6 inch 144Hz full HD display, i7-8750H processor and GTX 1070 for <del>$1,999.00</del> <a href="https://amzn.to/2P3GtMQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,799.00 on Amazon</a> (Save $200)</p></blockquote>
<h4>HP Pavilion 15 Gaming Laptop with GTX 1060 for $749</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3883 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion 15 gaming laptop - best black friday gaming laptop deal 2018" width="550" height="382" /></p>
<p>If you are a sucker for quality and bright display I suggest you proceed to the next laptop in this list. The limited sRGB coverage of the display makes this laptop unsuitable for photo and video editing and other works that require color accurate display.</p>
<p>One of the best attractions of this laptop though is its design and green backlit keyboard that feels like a knife on butter while typing. There is a better than average battery life of 6 hours and latest Intel Core i7 processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU with 4GB DDR5 graphics so can&#8217;t complain about that. Moreover there&#8217;s the 1TB 7200 RPM HDD with Intel Optane 16GB memory which ensures smooth gaming performance.</p>
<p>The HP Pavilion 15 gaming laptop is available right now for just $799.00; saving around $300 on <a href="https://amzn.to/2KAWqt5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> as a part of their amazing Cyber Monday discount. Another great deal on the same laptop also comes from Amazon itself. You can buy it with GTX 1050 Ti and i5-8300H for <a href="https://amzn.to/2r2TYTe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$699 at Amazon</a>, which is $150 less than its normal price.</p>
<h4>Alienware 17 R5</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4627" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Alienware-17-R5.jpg" alt="Alienware 17 R5" width="550" height="390" />The Alienware 17 R5&#8217;s best quality is the factory overclocked Nvidia GTX 1080 that makes this machine a gaming beast. Its only con might be its boxy design and too heavy to carry around body. In terms of CPU performance and processing, it ranks among the best gaming laptops out there and is even better if paired with the latest i9 chip. Nonetheless, we are here to present to you its i7 8th Gen 8750H with a reduced price tag, coupled with a 16GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD storage and a sharp 17.3&#8243; 1920 x 1080 IPS Anti-Glare display.</p>
<p>Get this laptop for $1,449.00 on <a href="https://deals.dell.com/productdetail/1s8i" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dell</a> and with a 256GB SSD on <a href="https://amzn.to/2zpGyFB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $1,545.00 saving around $150.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a smaller Alienware, then Alienware 15 is also available at a discounted price right now at Dell and NewEgg. The Alienware 15 with i7-8750H, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD and GTX 1060 is available for <a href="https://deals.dell.com/productdetail/1rhw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,399.00 on Dell</a> (saving you $400).</p>
<h4>HP Omen 15</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4005 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/HP-Omen-15.jpg" alt="HP Omen 15 - black friday gaming laptop deals 2018" width="550" height="401" /></p>
<p>The HP Omen 15 gaming laptop ranks amongst the best gaming notebooks in the affordable gaming laptop range. The 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8750H processor with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti chip are compatible enough to support almost all sorts of professional gaming. But, the affordable price has to be balanced somewhere in the specs and just when it sounded too good to be true HP decided to tone down the display quality. The 15.6-inch IPS anti-glare display inhibits poor color-space coverage and low display brightness.</p>
<p>You can get this game machine on <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JROdjP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $989.06 saving you $110. For power users, <a href="https://amzn.to/2TqBOb4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HP Omen 15 with GTX 1060</a> is also available at a discounted price right now at Amazon. Well, if you&#8217;re looking for an even more powerful machine, then you can have a <a href="https://amzn.to/2PBvQWy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Omen 15 with GTX 1070</a> at $1,699 right now which is $100 less than its list price. That variant comes with 32GB of RAM, 512GB of SSD and <strong>fast 144Hz refresh-rate 15.6-inch full HD display</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="http://tidd.ly/5a727378" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">configure it on HP</a> as per your likings and <strong>save $250</strong> on all configurations.</p>
<h4>HP Omen 17</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4148" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/HP-Omen-17.jpg" alt="HP Omen 17" width="550" height="389" /></p>
<p>An improvement on the Omen 15, the HP Omen 17 is a well-balanced gaming notebook where the display inadequacy is eliminated and the upshot is a bright full HD screen with good color reproduction. Another upgrade from the Omen 15  in this variant is the reduced CPU throttle, resulting from the better cooling system. But despite all the upgrades, the battery life went downhill and can give up to 4.5 hours of backup only.</p>
<p>With an 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8750H processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 12 GB DDR4 SDRAM, 1 TB storage and a bright 17.3-inch full HD IPS display, this gaming monster will cost you <a href="https://amzn.to/2RPJ3I3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,090.38 on Amazon</a> where you save around 130 bucks.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://tidd.ly/7d0dea6e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">configure the HP Omen 17</a> laptop as per your likings and save $300 at HP.</p>
<h4>Lenovo Legion Y530</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4082" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lenovo-Legion-Y530.jpg" alt="Lenovo Legion Y530" width="550" height="433" /></p>
<p>The Lenovo Legion Y530 gaming laptop while can handle most games on medium configurations, is certainly not a &#8216;hardcore&#8217; gaming machine. You should go for this one only if you are tight budgeted and like to enjoy some gaming in your free time and it will definitely not give you temperature problems. The chassis is to the point, no flashy keys or a fancy body. Lenovo has kept it simple with this one by going back to their roots.</p>
<p>With an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB, can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a bad investment for casual gamers. There is an Intel Core i7-8750H 6 core processor and a 1TB HDD + 128GB Solid State Drive for storage with a 16GB RAM in the mix for just <a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flegion-laptops%2Flegion-y-series%2FLenovo-Legion-Y530-15ICH%2Fp%2F81FV0014US%23tab-currentmodels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,034.50 on Lenovo&#8217;s web store</a> ($418 off). For budget conscious people, the Lenovo Legion Y530 with i7-8750H, GTX 1050 Ti, 8GB RAM and 1TB HDD is available for <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-legion-y530-15-6-laptop-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1050-ti-1tb-hard-drive-black%2F6219202.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$829.99 on Best Buy</a> with the discount of $100.</p>
<h3 id="cat2"><div class="su-heading su-heading-style-default su-heading-align-center" id="" style="font-size:30px;margin-bottom:0px"><div class="su-heading-inner"><span class="su-label su-label-type-black"><strong>Cyber Monday Deals on Convertibles &amp; 2-in-1s</strong></span></div></div></h3>
<h4>Acer Spin 5</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4602 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/acer_spin_5.jpg" alt="Acer Spin 5 Convertible Laptop" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>The Acer Spin 5 is an affordable option for gaming enthusiasts who have a knack for convertibility. The reasonable price of this laptop also makes it suitable for traditional users, looking for a sleek and stylish notebook to place on their living room table. The Acer Spin 5 is loaded with 8GB DDR4 Memory, 1TB HDD storage,  an 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8550U Processor (Up to 4.0GHz) and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 4 GB of dedicated GDDR5 VRAM for a little bit of gaming.</p>
<p>The coolest part is you can get this for just <del>$899.99</del> <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2RMhP54" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$749.99 on Amazon</a> with built-in Alexa.</p>
<h4>Lenovo Yoga 720 15&#8243;</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2906" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lenovo-Yoga-720.jpg" alt="Lenovo-Yoga-720" width="400" height="270" /></p>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga 720 15&#8243; is highly commendable for its bright lit display, extraordinary battery stand up and stereo sound all jammed up inside a sleek 2-in-1 convertible notebook. The downsides: the lack of ports (as expected), CPU throttling while under a little more load than usual, and a comparatively bulky body than other convertibles.</p>
<p>It does, however, support gaming and is not a bad option for gaming enthusiasts who want an all-day battery life along with a flexible convertible body which is a rare mix. The notebook is loaded with a 15.6-inch UHD display, 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 2GB graphics and a 16GB DDR4 RAM; all for just <a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2F700-series%2FYoga-720-15%2Fp%2F88YG7000828" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,058.81 from Lenovo</a> saving you whopping $591.</p>
<p>Well, if you don&#8217;t want the UHD display, then you can get the newer Yoga 730 15&#8243; laptop with Intel Core i7-8550U, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 4GB graphics for <a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2F700-series%2FYoga-730-15%2Fp%2F81CU000TUS%23tab-currentmodels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,034.99 from Lenovo</a> with the savings of $245.</p>
<p>The smaller Lenovo Yoga 730 13&#8243; is also discounted at Lenovo web store as a part of their cyber monday sale, so if you are looking for a portable machine that&#8217;s even easier to carry around and work on-the-go then you can check it out. The Yoga 730 13&#8243; with i7-8550U, 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD is available right now for $899.99 down from $1,299.99 saving you $400. | <a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2F700-series%2FYoga-730-13-%2Fp%2F81CT001PUS%23tab-currentmodels" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Get this Deal</a></p>
<h4>Microsoft Surface Book 2</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3138 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Microsoft-Surface-Book-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Book 2 - best 2-in-1 laptop deal of black friday 2018" width="550" height="313" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the area in which a benchmark has been set by the Surface Book 2,its exceptional battery life. Both 13 and 15-inch surface books are known for their crazy battery standup that lasts over 13 hours! Moreover, the detachable tablet mode is just a cherry on top for classifying this laptop as the ultimate portable gadget. It&#8217;s not just the battery life, the Surface Book 2 has excelled ever test that it has been put through. The over-the-top processing power, the seamless stylus support, the crystal clear display, and the comfortable keyboard. It is impossible for anyone not to be impressed.</p>
<p>You can get the 13.5 inches Surface Book 2 for <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ddr6Pq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,989.00 from Amazon</a> ($510 OFF). It holds an Intel Quad Core i7 Processor, 512 GB of storage, 16 GB RAM, and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 discrete GPU. The 15-inch model is up for <a href="https://amzn.to/2DNA5b4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$2,474.89 on Amazon</a> ($424 OFF) and boasts an Intel Quad Core i7 processor, 512 GB of storage, 16 GB RAM, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 discrete GPU that allows this laptop to be classified under gaming machines as well. Is there anything the Surface Book 2 cannot do?</p>
<p>But of course, no notebook is ever so perfect. For a large form factor of the laptop, the speakers are comparatively feeble and not dynamic enough. Moreover, it is quite pricey, the fully specced out variant of Surface Book 2 costs well over $3200. Though the Cyber Monday discount saves you a few bucks so it might fall into some of yours budget. Nonetheless, with no included stylus over a couple of grands is a lot to ask for.</p>
<h4>Google Pixelbook</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4629" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Google-Pixelbook.jpg" alt="Google Pixelbook" width="550" height="380" /></p>
<p>Before you even dive into the tech jibber jabber of this notebook, the form factor of this device is amazing enough to sweep anyone off their feet. If you are big on portability and like to carry around a trophy laptop, search no more. The best part is, it&#8217;s not all looks, the Google Pixelbook is worthy enough to stand side by side with the most high-end machines out there that we know of, like the MacBook Pro and Surface Pro. The battery life is exceptional and can hold upto 10 hours of charge but does, however, come with a small storage capacity.</p>
<p>Featuring a 7th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, an 8GB RAM and 256GB for storage, the handbook will cost you just <a href="https://amzn.to/2S3HPJf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$899.00 on Amazon</a>, allowing you to save around $300.</p>
<h4>HP Spectre x360 13&#8243; Laptop</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3137" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HP-Spectre-X360-13t-Quad-Core-Laptop.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Being sleek and convertible whilst having a robust and durable chassis is an art that not many manufacturers can achieve. But, it is nothing that will hold back HP. Though a little bulky, the HP Spectre x360 Laptop can be carried about your entire day and can even be given a few bumps and bruises without causing any damages.</p>
<p>The performance of its 8th Generation Intel Core i5 processor is solid enough to easily support graphical intensive workload and games. So, apart from business users (due to portability), its a good fit for gamers and media artists as well. Boasting an 8 GB memory, 256 GB SSD storage and a full 13.3&#8243; FHD touch display, the HP Spectre x360 will save you $240 no matter what the configurations.</p>
<p>Though you can get the said specs for <a href="http://tidd.ly/8ceac43a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$849.99 from HP</a>. But Hurry! As the offer is only up for limited time.</p>

<p>If you want to look fancy but your pocket doesn&#8217;t allow you to do so, try the HP ENVY x360 Laptop 15t. It has a sexy, lustrous and metallic looking body with all the niceties of premium notebooks. But of course, every low priced laptop comes with a &#8216;price&#8217; of its own. While you are busy flaunting this gorgeous notebook, you&#8217;d also have to drag around its power cord as the 5-hour battery life just isn&#8217;t enough to last a whole day. Apart from that, the display is kind of a turn-off and isn&#8217;t as light and bright as the body itself.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t really complain about anything else, the 8th Generation Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB RAM, and 1TB HDD are good enough to provide you some pro-level multitasking. That too on a really tight budget. This laptop is available with 16GB Intel Optane Memory and you will also get a preinstalled Windows 10. But then again, before you get carried away you should know that to make up for the short cost, HP has compromised on the quality and the laptop&#8217;s durability isn&#8217;t really commendable.</p>
<p>If you liked the HP Spectre x360 laptop but want to go a bit cheaper, you will not find a better option. You can get this sleek 2 in 1 notebook for just <del>$869.99</del> <a href="http://tidd.ly/4a52566f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$599.99 on HP</a> (Save $270)which is one of the cheapest prices in this list. This offer ends in a day as well and for such an affordable price, HP is offering a more than you can wish for.</p>

<p>On a reasonable price tag, the 2018 Dell Inspiron 13 5000 is a perfect fit for traditional users who do not crave high graphics performance and have a mainstream laptop usage. The 2018 Dell Inspiron 13 5000 is the go-to convertible for all who want i7 power on a budget. Its only let down is the average battery life and a mid-tier display.</p>
<p>With Intel Core i7-8550U Quad-Core processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD and Intel UHD Graphics 620 this convertible laptop is selling right now for just <a href="https://amzn.to/2T5eLSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$736.99 on Amazon</a>, saving you $163.</p>

<p>Just like the name implies, this gorgeous, flexible, 2-in-1 convertible is a power machine, hosting an 8th Generation Intel Core i7-8550U processor with a 16GB RAM and Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620. The notebook does lack a few aspects which might turn off advanced users as its really not built to support gaming. Nonetheless, it offers great value for its price when compared to its competitor convertible notebooks. This device doesn&#8217;t really classify as &#8216;affordable&#8217;, but does make your money&#8217;s worth, especially if you&#8217;re an artist.</p>

The Acer Swift 5 is a very capable 14-inch laptop which is just 0.6-inches thick and weighs 2.1 pounds. It is powered by an Intel Core i7-8550U quad-core processor with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD. You can currently get it for just <del>$1,272.87</del> <a href="https://amzn.to/2FGzrhj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$999.99 from Amazon</a> which is $272 less than its list price.</p>
<h4>Dell Vostro 5370 13-inch Laptop</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4646" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Dell-vostro-13-5370.jpeg" alt="Dell-vostro-13-5370" width="461" height="286" /></p>
<p>The Vostro 5370 has been loaded with enough specs that can give a little bit of oomph to your regular business usage.  While it might not be the most premium office notebook, it is, however, capable enough to support a certain amount of multi-tasking and a little bit of gaming as well if you are willing to explore a few titles. The good thing about this notebook is that it doesn&#8217;t sacrifice the ports selection just to trim down the bulkiness.</p>
<p>Loaded with an 8GB DDR4 RAM, a 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD, Intel UHD Graphics 620 and an 8th Generation Intel Core i5-8250U processor, the Vostro 5370 is available for 35% off the list price on <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/vostro-13-5000/spd/vostro-13-5370-laptop/cav135w10pc21123" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dell&#8217;s website</a> for $809.00.</p>
<h4>HP Pavilion 15t Laptop</h4>

<p>The HP Pavilion 15t laptop is a good fit for standard gamers and mid-level graphic designers. You can also configure this laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce MX150 chip and you are good to go for some exuberant gaming. Although, if you are not quite fond of gaming or media editing you can always trade the  dedicated Nvidia GPU for the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620. It doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll be deprived of gaming, you just won&#8217;t be able to run most of them on their highest settings. Another upside is that its complete metal body makes it lightweight enough to be portable. Another factor directly proportional to portability &#8211; battery standup, which is over 10 hours for this machine. So you can definitely leave your power cord at home while you carry it around about your day.</p>
<p>With Intel UHD Graphics 620, an 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB memory and  1TB HDD (with Intel Optane), you can get this device for just <a href="http://tidd.ly/ce93bd43" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$579.99 from HP</a>. Even if you boost up the specs a bit, you&#8217;ll still be able to avail this beautiful offer and save $420 on all configurations.

<p>The ASUS VivoBook S14 is one of our favorite all-purpose laptops of 2018. It comes with a 14-inch full HD display with tiny bezels and weighs just 3.2 pounds. Being an ultrabook it houses inside a powerful Intel Core i7-8550U quad-core processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU. The laptop is a complete all-rounder and can even run the latest games at medium to low graphics settings. It has got a $90 price cut at <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kwe69l" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> right now which we think makes it a great deal for anyone who is looking to purchase a lightweight all-purpose machine.</p>

<p>The XPS 13 9370 is one of the best inventions by Dell. I say so because it directly addresses all the problems that Dell users have faced in the past. The webcam has been repositioned a bit for better accessibility during video chats, there is more thermal room for the processor, the display is formidable, the 4K panel is fantastic and what not. It is undoubtedly the next-gen ultrabook.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s a little on the pricey side, but the cost is well-deserved for this outstanding device. It is currently on sale right now at <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13/spd/xps-13-9370-laptop/cax13w10p1c604s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dell</a>.

<p>The Acer Aspire 1 comes with a pre-installed Windows 10 OS and is a good competitor to certain Chromebooks. It&#8217;s a viable option for users with a modest wallet who prefer Windows over Chrome OS but are also willing to get most of their tasks done online since it provides just 64GB of internal storage.</p>
<p>Its Intel Celeron N4000 Dual-Core Processor doesn&#8217;t quite make its performance stand out in any way but does help you get some minor multi-tasking, lightweight processing, and document editing done. If you are big on spreadsheets and numbers, the absence of a numeric keypad might be a letdown. Nonetheless, it provides more than enough productivity for the price it comes in and ranks among the top affordable notebooks.</p>

<p>The Samsung Chromebook 3 is an amazingly affordable option for multi-taskers. For just a couple of hundred bucks, this Chromebook is more than just a basic laptop to play the games available in the play store and edit documents. The Samsung Chromebook 3 held itself pretty steady when put through various tasks simultaneously. Working multiple browser tabs, photo editing, and media streaming could not diminish the performance of this notebook in the slightest.</p>
<p>It offers a solid 10-hour battery life and the display is rich and vibrant under all kinds of lighting. But, Samsung had to cut cost somewhere so, they put in some shabby speakers and a not so great keyboard. Moreover, the exterior doesn&#8217;t really give off a &#8216;premium laptop&#8217; vibe. But then again, IT IS NOT one and only costs <a href="https://amzn.to/2FEkQmu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$175.00 at Amazon</a> right now down from its already great $220 price tag.</p>
<p>It holds an 11.6 inch display, an Intel Celeron Processor, a 4 GB memory oh, and did I tell you? Its spill resistant too. So, in a nutshell, it checks almost all boxes and provides an all-day battery life. To be fair it adds a lot of value to its price and the 10-hour standup is something that not the most high-end laptops in this list provide.</p>

<h4>ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2965 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C302CA-DHM4.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook Flip - black friday chromebook deals" width="550" height="491" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another Chromebook for you which is actually a convertible type, as it&#8217;s only fair to have more than one selection for each category. The ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA checks all boxes from the portability perspective. It is lightweight, its convertible, it has a decent battery standup and the display is vibrant and crisp that can adjust itself under all kinds of lightings.</p>
<p>It does, however, come with a steeper price tag from the other Chromebooks and the speakers are so bad they aren&#8217;t even worth mentioning. So you might be able to carry it around everywhere but would also have to invest in a good pair of headsets. Again, the non-existence of a dedicated numpad restricts you from some document and spreadsheets editing.</p>
<p>For $474.99 (down from $499.99), the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA comes with an Intel Core M3-6Y30 Processor with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM. You can buy it from <a href="https://amzn.to/2Tnnznv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for a 5% discount.</p>
