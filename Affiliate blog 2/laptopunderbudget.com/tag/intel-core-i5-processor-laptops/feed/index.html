<p>When it comes to productivity and reliable battery life, no other brands till now have come any closer to the tech-giant Apple’s MacBook series of laptops. It is styled in a complete aluminum casing, which is provided with a smooth metal finish. The laptop looks premium and is even more thinner and lighter than the previous MacBook Air at a mere 0.61-inches and 2.7 pounds respectively.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Air runs macOS Mojave out of the box and comes preloaded with a host of useful apps. It is powered by a Y-series Intel Core i5 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. It&#8217;s an ample example to explain that specifications aren&#8217;t everything, but it is the mutual working between hardware and software of a device which makes it efficient.</p>
<p>Though the laptop is not as powerful as its competitors in the list, it is surely capable of outlasting most laptops with i5 processor when it comes to productivity. Speaking of productivity, the new MacBook Air for the first time comes with the Retina display, new butterfly mechanism keyboard with Touch ID and a large trackpad similar to the MacBook Pro laptops from Apple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a bit pricey, though. It starts at $1099 and for the price you get a very basic set of specifications. Although it can be configured with more RAM and storage, those upgrades adds up a lot to the price.</p>

<p>Dell&#8217;s XPS lineup of laptops has always been one of the best premium Windows ultrabooks packed with the newest hardware and features. The <a title="Dell XPS 13 (2018) Review – Best Windows Ultrabook Money can Buy" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/dell-xps-13-2018-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 Dell XPS 13</a> was one of our favorite Windows ultrabooks, but it had one major flaw. Its webcam was a nose peeker as it was located on the bottom bezel of the display. The latest 2019 Dell XPS 13 fixes this problem, and we think it is the perfect Windows ultrabook to date. It is made from the premium materials like carbon fiber, glass, and aluminum and comes in two svelte looking finishes, namely platinum silver and frost white. It is very thin and weighs less than 3 pounds but still manages to pack latest Whiskey Lake Intel Core i5 quad-core processor inside making it an equally capable ultrabook.</p>
<p>Its 13.3-inch full HD InfinityEdge display is a treat to the eyes, and it is also very bright and color-accurate panel. On the hardware front, it bolsters an 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD, which should be enough for most users. The ports, however, are very limited on the 2019 model, as it comes with only 3 USB Type-C ports and an SD card slot. While those Type-C ports do support thunderbolt connections, but to connect any traditional USB device you will need a dongle. Apart from that, there is no additional graphics card provided with the laptop and thus, can serve the gaming purpose to a limited extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the Dell XPS 13 is still the best thin and light i5 powered ultrabook, which is powerful enough to be an excellent daily performer.</p>

It is powered by the latest Whiskey Lake Intel Core i5 processor with integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics. The powerful hardware packed inside the thin and light chassis that weighs just 2.8 pounds makes it one of our favorite budget Intel Core i5 ultrabooks right now.</p>
<p>It offers an 8GB of RAM for smooth multitasking, and for storage, it comes with a speedy 256GB of SSD. However, like most ultrabooks, the RAM is soldered on the motherboard of the Pavilion 13 making its hardware impossible to upgrade. It has 13 inches of Full HD display which offers excellent viewing angles, and it is also bright and rich in color. Moreover, the laptop comes with a backlit keyboard, and features all the required ports including the fastest and multi-purpose USB 3.1 Type-C port.</p>
<p>I think the best i5 laptop deal cannot get any sweeter than this for the budget ultrabook seekers. Hence, this is the perfect laptop for students, business people or anyone who is looking for the power-packed and affordable lightweight laptop for themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-exterior-design.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 2018 - exterior design" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Our Most Recommended Portable Laptops</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>

<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Musicians and DJs</a></strong></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4252" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-image-4252 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-9370-2018-battery-test.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 2018 - battery test" width="733" height="550"><p id="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-caption-text">Image by &#8211; forester401 on flickr</p></div>
<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">ASUS has been one of the global best sellers in laptops division and has been launching various segment of laptops to satisfy various niches. ASUS has recently announced their new gaming series of laptops under TUF (The Ultimate Force), which is derived from the company’s motherboard naming. Considering the major shift of users towards the budget segment laptops, the company has launched the TUF series of gaming laptops, which are mid-rangers, unlike the high-end ROG series of gaming laptops.</p>
<p>TUF motherboards from ASUS are known for their reliability, and stability under extreme conditions. And, same has been brought down in building these new mid-range TUF gaming laptops by the taiwanese giant. On top of this, all these laptops are now powered by the all-new, 8th-generation Intel Core processors.</p>
<p>ASUS has been claiming that the latest TUF series of gaming laptops were designed to last longer than most of the already-available average laptops.</p>
<p>So, after hearing so much about these series of laptops, we decided to put the ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop to the test in our lab, to make our readers familiar with the real-time usage of this mid-range gaming laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX504 comes with an all-plastic body with a red hue to the finishing. The laptop looks stylish and lushes out the gaming pattern from every angle. It comes with the right placement of keyboard, trackpad, ports, and slots, making it one of the most ergonomic laptops in the segment.</p>
<p>Speaking about the dimensions of the device, it measures 15.12 x 10.31 x 0.98 inches in length, breadth, and thickness. The laptop weighs <strong>just over 5 pounds</strong>, making it easy to carry around. Without speaking much about the regular aspects of the device, let’s drill down to what are the special features in the design of this laptop.</p>
<div id="attachment_3776" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3776" class="wp-image-3776 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-Review-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop Review - Design" width="550" height="555" /><p id="caption-attachment-3776" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Metallic Premium Steel Finish on Lid with a Glowing Red ASUS Logo</strong></em></p></div>
<p>ASUS has worked hard and equipped the TUF FX504 with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">advanced anti-dust cooling system</span>. This system is meant to expel the dust particles out of the innards of the laptops through the two available dedicated tunnels, ensuring zero dust residues inside the laptop. Being a gaming laptop, the FX504 has to manage the heating issues and to deal with this, ASUS has integrated the HyperCool technology in the laptop for thermal maintenance. During our test, we couldn&#8217;t tell about the dust as internals were already neat and tidy, but laptop remained cool and calm during our heavy to hardcore usage including gaming.</p>
<p>All in all, the laptop looks absolutely charm and considering the price point, its build quality is also top-notch. Of-course, it isn&#8217;t like a laptop built completely from a single piece of metal, but materials used by ASUS to built their new TUF series of gaming laptops are tough and will ensure the longer life span, no matter in what conditions you use this laptop.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 laptop comes with three different display options with varied refresh rates. Our current contender, the FX504 sports a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Our review unit had a low quality 60Hz TN Panel with 45% in NTSC color gamut. As you would expect, the viewing angles are pathetic and color-reproduction is also very dull. However, it is decent enough for gaming once you set it in the right position and we also liked the matte finishing on the display.</p>
<p>Well, if you want a better display, then Asus does offer TUF FX504 laptop with a full HD 120Hz IPS panel (94% in NTSC color range) but that costs extra and adds up a lot to its original price.</p>
<p>So overall, we think that the display on the laptop could have been a bit better in terms of brightness and viewing angles to suffice the gaming enthusiasts needs.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the internals of the ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop, it is powered by the latest 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. This latest processor can be turbo boosted up to a massive 3.9GHz under full throttle, making it one of the fastest laptops in its segment.</p>
<p>On graphics front, our unit had a less powerful 2GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU but TUF FX504 laptop is also available with GTX 1050 Ti (More on the gaming performance later). Storage on the device is handled by a 1TB of FireCuda storage, bagging the laptop yet another advantage over the other laptops with a normal HDD.  The solid-state hybrid disk (SSHD) on this laptop offers speed, which is twice as fast as a normal hard disk. This helps in faster data transfer speeds, and also helps in loading the applications quickly. The hard drive also ensures less power consumption while maintaining performance and durability.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the laptop is concerned, the laptop has two RAM slots which can accept the RAM up to 32GB and there&#8217;s also a PCIE Gen 3 slot inside for SSD.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800 of 2018</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 comes with a very sturdy keyboard, which the company claims to take up to 20 million key presses. Each key on the keyboard delivers a 1.8mm travel distance, to give a better and more efficient tactile feedback.</p>
<div id="attachment_3779" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-image-3779 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Review.jpg" alt="Keyboard with 1.8mm key travel and spaced function keys" width="643" height="424" /><p id="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>1.8mm traveling curved keys</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop has been designed with gaming in mind while not compromising on the looks and design. Accordingly, the keyboard on the device also gives the laptop the right gaming hue to satisfy almost all the users. The keyboard is backlit enabled and is curved to the right extent to give a better usage for working in dark.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers with Most Comfortable Keyboard</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Considering the fact that this laptop is a primarily gaming-stationed one, you get a decent list of specifications, which will suffice the gaming needs. The device comes with two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and an HDMI 1.4 port. The device also comes with a microSD card reader.</p>
<div id="attachment_3778" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3778" class="wp-image-3778 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-from-Side.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop from Side" width="531" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-3778" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>No ports on right hand side to keep your gaming mouse</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Moreover, all these ports are aligned on the left hand side of the notebook, keeping the right side fully-free for the mouse. That earns ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop 10 out of 10 for the ergonomics.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 runs on the Windows 10 operating system out of the box. Windows 10 is the most efficient and productive operating system to date and is highly optimized to house and run most of the modern games and apps.</p>
<p>Thanks to the windows store, users can get almost all sort of applications such as productive, utilities, entertainment, gaming, and more with ease. The device also comes with some handy features such as multi-window, small-window support to show important notifications and instructions, without interrupting the gaming experience. Considering all these aforementioned features, Windows 10 is an ideal operating system for all the hardcore gamers.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 is one of the few laptops available in the market right now to come with the latest 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H quad-core processor right now. Accordingly, the laptop did surprise us with its impeccable speeds and resource handling abilities. Thanks to its 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop&#8217;s multitasking is quite well, and during our usage, we never actually had to shed a sweat using it. That said, the laptop is undeniably an able device for almost all the everyday essentials such as browsing, watching videos, playing audio files, working on documents and more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Best Laptops with Intel Core i5 Processor &#8211; Newest 8th Gen Models</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the connectivity of the device, it comes with super fast Wave 2 WiFi for high speed reliable wireless connectivity. Moreover, the 2&#215;2 MIMO configuration provides up to 30% wider coverage area than the basic 1&#215;1 configuration for uninterrupted gaming even at the less WiFi reception areas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3780" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Performance" width="550" height="564" /></p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming on the device, the higher clock speed of the processor and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU runs the show. The laptop does exceptionally well in handling almost all of the moderate games. High-end games can also be played on the device, with some restrictions considering this is a mid-range gaming device which has less powerful GPU with just 2GB of DDR5 VRAM.</p>
<p>One thing that we note during our test is the laptop doesn’t heat up even after heavy gaming, thanks to its dual fans with advanced hyper cooling technology. All in all, we had a good time with this laptop in terms of everyday performance as well as gaming.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>As I’ve been saying, the laptop also does pretty well in terms of serving as a multimedia powerhouse. It comes with an immersive 7.1-channel surround sound along with DTS headphone slot. When using the laptop with a headset on, we actually felt the theatre like sound, which helped a lot while playing First-person Shooter games on the laptop. In addition to the powerful speakers, it also comes with a powerful built-in equalizer, which allows adjusting the sound as per the user’s requirements.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; Djing of 2018</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>We also played almost all video formats on the device, and we didn’t have any issue worth mentioning. The built-in microphone on the ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop is also worth applauding. We tested it by recording the audio and to our surprise it sounded crystal clear. We also tried using its built-in microphone for commanding the Cortana (Windows assistant) in a room with a lot of noise, and in such conditions as well, it filtered out all the ambient noise and picked up clear voice quite efficaciously.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a lithium-ion battery, which takes about <strong>2.5 hours to fully charge</strong> from 0 to 100. During our review, we were actually surprised to see the battery backup of the device considering the fact that it’s a gaming stationed laptop. Even after heavy usage and multitasking, we still managed to get about 6 hours of continuous usage on a single charge, which is pretty good for a gaming laptop of this calibre.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3782" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Thin-and-Light-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Thin and Light Gaming Laptop Review" width="550" height="569" /></p>
<p>With all our experience with the different laptop models, we can definitely assert that no device is perfect. Every laptop has to undergo a couple trade-offs if not more to meet the requirements. Accordingly, the ASUS TUF FX504 is a very reliable and powerful laptop with decent specifications. However, there are couple of misses, which we could evidently notice. The first being the display, which is a very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">low-quality TN panel</span> and second is its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less powerful Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU</span> which provides just 2GB of dedicated video memory.</p>
<p>But if we exclude these things, then ASUS is offering a very good package overall with the trust seal of TUF. You get all the latest set of hardware specifications and highly intuitive anti-dust cooling system which not only improves the performance but also enhances the life-span of the laptop.</p>
<p>So, if you want a &#8220;tough&#8221; gaming laptop that can run most AAA titles at medium graphics settings then the ASUS TUF FX504 is the gaming laptop you will love it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA is a revamped version of the previous VivoBook edition of laptops launched by the company. This time ASUS has been in trend and made its laptops much more elegant, sleek, and stylish. The laptops are also lighter and are marginally thinner than its predecessors and weigh just about 3.7 pounds and come with measurements of 14.2 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches.</p>
<div id="attachment_3097" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-image-3097 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop - Design" width="650" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thinner &amp; Lighter (Just 0.8-inch thick and weighs 3.7 pounds)</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a brushed metal, shiny chassis, in a glittering grey color. The laptop is thicker at the hinge-edge and gradually gets narrower. The design aspects of the VivoBook, we feel, are largely drawn from the likes of the <a title="Check Current Price of MacBook Air on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2hKvugK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple’s MacBook Air</a> externally. The placement of ports, trackpad, keyboard, and other vitals are very similar to the previous generation of VivoBooks, and all in all, the laptop feels quite easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3098 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop Review" width="650" height="386" /></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of this laptop is that it comes with an ultra-narrow 0.3-inch ASUS’ proprietary NanoEdge bezel, which gives an amazing 80% of screen-to-body ratio. The bezels on the laptop are fairly negligible and are probably one of the rarest laptops in the market currently to offer such slim bezel display in a laptop at such low price.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, ASUS VivoBook F510UA makes it feels like you have a full-size 15.6” FHD WideView display embedded into a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a>, which not only makes it compact and sleek to use, but also offers wider, bigger, and much better display. On a final note on the design and build quality, the laptop comes with a uniform solid build quality and certainly is beautiful enough to attract the masses.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LED display which is vibrant. As far as the resolution of the display is concerned, it comes with a Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. As mentioned earlier, the laptop’s WideView makes it look even better, and thanks to its larger display, the viewing angles on this machine are perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_3099" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-image-3099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop - Display Review" width="800" height="445" /><p id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also comes with the ASUS’ proprietary Splendid visual optimization technology, which automatically provides the optimized visuals to the user for almost any kind of content being played. The laptop comes with custom features as well as pre-installed display modes such as Normal, Vivid, Eye-Care, and Manual, which can be accessed and enabled based on the user’s choice. The videos on the screen also turn out to be a visual treat all thanks to the ASUS Tru2Life Video technology which enhances the movie watching experience on this laptop. The display on this device comes with an intelligent set of sensors which optimises the essential visual parameters such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and hue in every pixel to produce vivid and lively imagery.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA laptop offers a robust set of innards and is undeniably a powerful device on the paper. Let’s have a quick glance at what does the laptop offers. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the latest and the most advanced, 8th Generation of Intel Core i5-8250U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 1.6GHz which can, however, rattle up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Laptops with Intel Core i5 8th Gen Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Multitasking and the applications on the device are handled by an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage department on the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of HDD, which is although ample amount of storage, still lags behind SSD when it comes to data transfer speeds and efficiency. We hoped that the laptop comes with an SSD storage, this could have been a deadly combination for a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $500</a>. The laptop comes with an integrated graphics coprocessor and doesn’t come with any additional GPU.</p>
<p>VivoBook also comes with a fingerprint sensor to add a layer of security to the device and the data in it. This is certainly one of the rare finds in a laptop priced at this range.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the hardware is concerned, the laptop&#8217;s RAM can be upgraded up to 16GB, and its hard drive is also swappable with solid state drive. So, overall ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is a future-proof device which not only provides all current generation hardware specifications but also ensures that it stays up to date with time.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The VivoBook comes with a VGA front-facing camera, and like most of the other laptops in the segment, the front camera on the device is just serviceable. It can capture decent images in daylight conditions and fails to add details under low-light. The image rendering of the device’s camera is quick and is able enough to capture fleeting moments during a video call. There’s nothing exceptional about the webcam on this laptop, and at the same time, do note that there’s nothing to complain as well.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the ports and connectivity options on the VivoBook, it comes with a standard set of ports, which is more or less a common practice in most of the laptops. All the ports are uniformly distributed along the two sides of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Ports and Slots" width="800" height="370" /></p>
<p>The device comes with one USB 3.1 and one USB 3.0 port, for faster, reliable, and efficient data transfers. And, comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports for adding up additional peripherals. It also houses an HDMI, 3.5mm Audio Jack, and an SD card reader.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop comes with Windows 10 Home variant pre-installed. Windows 10, which is world&#8217;s most used computer operating system, needs no introduction of what it’s capable of. The laptop doesn’t come with any much of the bloatware and is, therefore, fast, efficient, and nag-free. The device, however, does come pre-installed with some of the productive aspects and tools, which ought to increase the overall productivity of the system.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to its powerful and most importantly, the latest set of hardware and innards, the VivoBook offers excellent performance for the budget. No matter how strong the specifications are on paper, what actually matters is its real-time usage and performance. And during our usage and hands-on with this sleek and stylish looking laptop, we were satisfied with its overall performance.</p>
<p>The laptop stays quiet and offers decent graphic-based tasks performance. That said, as the laptop doesn’t come with a specific dedicated graphics coprocessor, the gaming on the device might not cater hardcore gamers. However, thankfully, it can handle small to mediocre demanding games quite well, thanks to the Intel&#8217;s integrated UHD 620 graphics.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Multimedia stands as a common stop for all sorts of laptop users. Be it gamers, businessmen, students, regular home purpose, no matter what the need is, a laptop will undeniably be used as a source of multimedia.</p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA comes with Two Built-in Stereo Speakers which provides very powerful and thumping audio output. During our review, we tested the speakers with bass heavy, punchy tracks, accustomed mids, and also treble stationed lean tracks. And to our surprise, the sound was pretty clear on all the occasions.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, it can handle almost all forms of videos and codecs. 4K and Full HD videos were playing absolutely lag-free and thanks to its wide viewing angles, we actually had a good time watching content on this laptop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Battery Life</span></p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA was one among the very first laptop we tested, which came along with the 8th Gen Intel core processors and we must say, the chipsets are very power efficient and robust. The laptop offers decent battery backup and is probably way ahead of most of its rivals in the segment.</p>
<p>On a single charge, the laptop stays juiced up for about 5-6 hours of continuous usage. It takes just over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. The battery type on this laptop is a Li-Ion one, and our final comments on the battery life would be <em>&#8216;The laptop did not fail us in terms of battery life,&#8217;</em> while most others in this price range don&#8217;t provide this good specs and battery life for the price!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2960 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Not every laptop in the market comes with the latest 8th Gen Intel core processors and decent battery life. Even if they do, they will certainly not look as polished and solid as the ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop. Moreover, the price point of $500 makes this laptop an unarguably one of the better offerings you can get currently in the market. Provided, you are not looking for a gaming-stationed laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 comes with a matte finish all plastic body, which gives the old school look of a common laptop. On the very first view, there was nothing groundbreaking about the laptop, as far its design and looks are concerned. The laptop although looks a little thick and hefty, it is actually, a very ergonomically built work machine. The laptop comes with the right placement of ports and connectivity slots, and all in all feels way better than its other competitors in the market.</p>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15 x 10.1 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weighs close to 5.2 pounds, which we felt was a little heavy for a laptop this calibre. However, it wasn&#8217;t that heavy to be considered as a drawback.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2685" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-Series-P2540UA-AB51-Business-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="650" height="627"></p>
<p>Space on both the edges of the laptop are well managed and are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The keyboard and the trackpad placement on the device are ideal for most cases and feels of superior quality.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>ASUS P2540UA-AB51 has a 720p camera, which adequately does the work of capturing images and video calls. The laptop’s webcam provides a grainy output when snapping images, but on an overall note, the webcam on this laptop is quite serviceable.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ASUS P-Series P2540-AB51 laptop comes with Windows 10 Home (64 bit) operating system pre-installed. This is probably the best part of this laptop; The operating system. Windows 10 Home variant has been customised by various laptop vendors and has been baking with unnecessary bloatware. However, on ASUS P2540UA-AB51, the OS doesn&#8217;t have any bloatware and is absolutely the pure Windows OS.</p>
<p>Sounds unbelievable, Right? Well, we also thought the same until we tested this laptop and found that it has not a single app or software pre-installed when it booted for first time.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Considering the price tag, the laptop offers top-notch performance. Thanks to its latest set of specifications and hardware packed beneath the hood the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 delivers a very efficient and stable performance even under prolonged sessions of continuous usage. Since the laptop is powered by the latest seventh generation of Intel Core i5 processor, it doesn&#8217;t heat up even after a rugged usage. The laptop stays cool and stays calm, delivering the optimum performance expected.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2695" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-series-P2540UA-Business-Laptop-Overall-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS P-series P2540UA Business Laptop - Overall Performance Review" width="650" height="626"></p>
<p>We used the laptop rigorously to run our benchmarking apps and also streamed Full HD and 4K content for hours together. We also had a continuous browsing session with around 8-10 tabs alive concurrently in Chrome. Surprisingly, the laptop managed to multitask with ease, without any hassle. Thus, delivering an uninterrupted performance.</p>
<p>Speaking about the connectivity, we faced no issues to latch onto WiFi networks and the laptop provided good and constant connectivity without any bandwidth merging related issues. All that said, the laptop is an excellent multi-tasking device and can deliver a very reliable performance for all type of usages.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As the laptop is bolstered by an integrated Intel HD graphics, the gaming on this laptop is strictly mediocre. With its Intel HD 620 Graphics, the laptop delivers just average graphics rendering. Thankfully, the laptop can still run games, provided they aren&#8217;t graphic heavy. This laptop is not meant for gaming, and therefore, gaming is your primary requirement then this laptop is not for you. However, you can still play low-to-medium graphics enabled games on this laptop with ease.</p>
<p>The titles we ran on this laptop and managed to run smoothly after scaling down the graphics are &#8211; Minecraft (45 fps), Counter Strike &#8211; Global Offensive (40 fps).</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is although a business entered all-purpose laptop, it still has the potential to satisfy multimedia stationed users. That said, the laptop can play 4K content with ease and thanks to its bright antiglare display, watching content on this laptop is a delight.</p>
<p>But wait! there’s a catch, the laptop although have a good set of specifications, its speakers aren&#8217;t the best and they tend to get muffled up at higher volumes. The volume levels are also strictly mediocre. Therefore, we’d suggest the users to either go with an additional set of the audio system to aid the laptop.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Here comes the most essential and crucial zone of the laptop, the battery backup. Finding laptops with long-lasting batteries is no less than a herculean task these days. We cannot simply trust the numbers written by laptop manufacturers which are although intended to create the hype.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our current contender, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51, does exceptionally well in this segment.</p>
<p>The laptop provided up slightly over 8 hours of battery backup on a single charge with normal use, which is rather phenomenal in a laptop that is priced below $500! Again that depends upon one&#8217;s usages. While gaming we noticed that the battery backup was dropped to mere 3 hours and we had to plugin the charger which took about 3 hours to completely charge its lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note &#8211; The charging time can be reduced by keeping the laptop in the sleep mode or by shutting down the Windows.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2696" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P2540UA-AB51-15.6-Inch-Laptop-Battery-Life.jpg" alt="ASUS P2540UA-AB51 15.6 Inch Laptop - Battery Life" width="650" height="653"></p>
<p>The best thing about this laptop is, it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a removable battery</span> which makes it easy for users to replace the battery pack. So, if you&#8217;re a power user then you can buy another battery of the laptop and the full day battery backup will be just one battery swap away for you.</p>
<p>Considering the specifications the laptop offers and its performance, over 8 hours of battery life, is something which you don&#8217;t often find these days. So, if you are finding a long lasting laptop with performance, enough to meet your everyday tasks, then the <a href="http://amzn.to/2tx8oJY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop</a> is the right choice for you.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2687" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/asus-p-series-p2540ua-ab51-business-laptop-1.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop Review" width="500" height="352"></p>
<p>ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop is worth the every penny you&#8217;re going to spend on it. The laptop comes with a decent ergonomics, a long list of connectivity options, powerful innards, and a very bright and responsive display. Wait, there’s more, the laptop also comes with a fingerprint sensor for added security and comes with pure Windows OS.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an ideal laptop for your everyday essentials or for business, your search for a laptop under $500 should end here. Look no further and go with this laptop. However, there are few misses on this laptop such as mediocre audio output and lack of powerful gaming performance.

<h3 class="p1">Design</h3>
<p>Few contemporaries might give Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop a tough time when it comes to specifications but in the context of design, it is going to emerge as a winner. The modern day design adds up to the image of new generation laptop; the sleek, stylish and fitting in design makes this laptop the best product for everyone looking forward to do their work in style.</p>
<div id="attachment_2400" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-image-2400 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-15.6-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 15.6- Laptop Design" width="550" height="386" /><p id="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Icicle Gold Metallic Frame</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The fact that Asus F5556UA is a lightweight laptop, makes it easier for people to chose this particular machine over the others because there are very less laptops in this segment weighing near to 5 lbs. The Asus F556UA weighs 5.1lbs and it is one of the sleekest 15 inch laptop available in the market right now. So all you tech fanatics, who wanted to have something slim in your bag packs, here is the love of your dreams.</p>
<p>Although, Asus F556UA is a slim and sleek laptop, it doesn&#8217;t compromise in offering any of the required ports &amp; slots. For more info on what ports and slots does it offer, continue reading.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The stylish Asus F556UA has a screen quality that will put critics to shame, the quality output and controlled emission of blue-light makes movies more fun and safer. The 15.6-inch Full HD LED-Lit display has a matte coating, which minimizes screen glare and protect eyes against fatigue.</p>
<div id="attachment_2401" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-image-2401 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blue-light-filter-on-Asus-F556UA-AB54-NB-15-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Blue light filter on Asus F556UA-AB54 NB 15 inch Laptop" width="611" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54&#8217;s <em>Eye Care Mode to reduce blue light</em></strong></p></div>
<p>The display panel is way slimmer and stylish when compared to other contemporaries. People who are looking forward to have an affordable laptop with some stylish features can definitely go ahead with this laptop. Even prolonged laptop users like <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops For Programming – A One Stop Shop Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers</a> are going to love the unique combination of Full HD screen view with eye-protection features.</p>
<p>Color accuracy and brightness levels of display are also up to the par, making it <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right choice for photo editing pros</a>. Overall display quality of Asus F556UA is really good and there’s hardly any laptop in this segment that can give it a tough competition. I would give five out of five stars to this laptop when it comes to serving people with quality entertainment.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>When it comes to laptop, people think of HDD and RAM as the only legitimate specifications but there’s a lot more to consider like clock speed, processor count and also processor brand. Yes! clock speed and processor count are directly proportional to the speed at which a laptop processes data. That said, the Asus F556UA-AB54 sports a powerful dual core 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U processor which is from the latest 7th Generation family of processors from Intel.</p>
<div id="attachment_2402" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-image-2402 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-Laptop-Hardware-Specifications.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 Laptop Hardware Specifications" width="550" height="411" /><p id="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>256GB SSD | 7th Generation Intel Core i5 Processor | Windows 10 64-bit &#8211; still<em> so slim!</em></strong></p></div>
<p>While Asus F556UA may appear as the thought leader in processor segment but it is bit disappointing with disk space, the laptop comes with a 256GB of SSD, which is neither enough nor in competition with the other contemporaries. Laptops in this segment generally have 1TB of HDD, whereas 500GB of HDD is considered to be the basic. Asus must work on it and release a newer version with doubled disk-space sooner.</p>
<p>Let alone the processor and disk-space, the RAM is designed to empower the already impressive processor speed. The 8GB of RAM will be able to queue up more processes and allow the processor to process them without making the laptop freeze. The smart combination of Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM is going to do wonders for workaholics and entertainment freaks.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Asus is generally not known for camera quality but with the newly designed display in place, this F556UA produces pretty impressive images. One can easily depend upon this webcam for <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating tutorial videos for youtube</a> and help the tech naysayers out there. Long story short, the webcam on Asus F556UA-AB54 is not the best you can get in segment but it is pretty good for business meetings on Skype.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Unlike the modern day laptops, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is slim and still houses all kind of ports, there’s a USB 2.0, 3.0, Type-C, an HDMI, a DVD+RW, a card reader slot and also 3.5 mm jack for quality audio video output.</p>
<p>So, you get all the ports and slots that you were familiar with on your previous computer and also the newest and fastest USB Type-C port, which is expected to do the wonders with future of computing.</p>
<div id="attachment_2403" style="width: 1015px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-image-2403 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ports-and-Slots-on-Asus-F556UA-15-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots on Asus F556UA 15 Inch Laptop" width="1005" height="265" /><p id="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Asus F556UA being a laptop with slim &amp; sleek profile provides best in class connectivity.</strong></em></p></div>
<p>I think other laptop manufacturers should learn something from Asus about making slim laptops without compromising on REQUIRED ports and slots!</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA comes pre-installed with Windows 10 64-bit operating system. It is a premium Windows laptop, which ensures free upgrade to all further Windows 10 updates. With that said, the Asus F556UA does come with a few free preloaded software packages which are &#8220;actually useful&#8221;. Asus F556UA comes with one-year warranty but the customer service of the enterprise is not that great! <a title="Laptop Tech Support Showdown! Our 2017 Ratings" href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/tech-support-showdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer and Dell emerges as a better leader</a> when it comes to providing customers with quality support and after sales support. On top of all these features, the Windows 10&#8217;s proprietary voice-assistance Cortana, is a big added advantage for the potential laptop users, and now it supports multiple languages and regions, making it geographically distinct in terms of support.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Packed with Intel core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, the laptop is designed to cater people with exceptional performance. From students, to employees to artists, this laptop is perfect for anyone with normal to mediocre level of requirements.</p>
<p>The dual core Kaby Lake i5-7200U processor has the base clock frequency of 2.5GHz and turbo boost frequency up to 3.10GHz. The processor has got all the caliber required to run and accommodate almost all the apps very smoothly without much lag. The laptop during our review, did respond well to the inputs and all the hardcore apps we threw at it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2405" style="width: 903px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-image-2405 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Performance-review-of-Asus-F556UA-laptop.jpg" alt="Performance review of Asus F556UA laptop" width="893" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS IceCool Technology keeps laptop always COOL and STABLE</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also responds very efficiently when a series of programs are launched simultaneously. One can definitely multi-task on this laptop without witnessing an iota of heat being produced. It also has the smart Asus ice-cool technology which controls inside temperature of the laptop and makes sure that the laptop always stay at comfortable temperature.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop is going to rank par above the contemporaries because the Full HD LED-lit 15 inch screen and the pitch perfect audio makes it easier for the artists to note the nitty gritty of each and every songs. The output through 3.5mm jack is an immaculate example of quality. One can finally posses a laptop that produces exceptional stereo output and is in the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">range of $500</a>. The laptop comes with the ASUS’s proprietary <strong>SonicMaster audio technology</strong> meant to fine-tune the audio output. It was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. It supports a long list of professional codecs to ensures precise sound performance. In addition to all these, it has an optimised amplifier to deliver louder volumes and deeper bass.</p>
<div id="attachment_2406" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-image-2406 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SonicMaster-Powered-Immersive-Audio-and-Video-Experience.jpg" alt="SonicMaster Powered Immersive Audio and Video Experience" width="550" height="437" /><p id="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Pitch-perfect Audio</strong></em></p></div>
<p>To test the video playback abilities of the Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop, we ran a set of HD, Full HD, and 4K content on it, to which the laptop responded really well. The detailing of the screen and the sound quality were simply superb thanks to its powerful speakers and bright display panel.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>This laptop is certainly not designed specifically for gaming but one can always run some old games on this laptop with great ease. Designed to leverage people with an exceptional working experience, this laptop is packed with specifications that can run some of your most favorite games with great ease. The laptop may lose when it comes to graphic output capacity because of lack of dedicated cards but the quality is certainly not poor. That said, it can run quite a good menu of games from the market, and being powered by the Windows 10 OS, the laptop supports a wide-range of games and apps to choose from. The modern games from the current market catalogue are also pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to checkout &#8211; <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA is packed with a 38-Whr-polymer battery which performans 2.5 times better than the standard Li-ion battery. It was compulsory for this laptop to have a long lasting battery because of the Full HD display that it is fitted with. The exceptional battery-life is going to make easier for people to go on and on without looking for a charger every now and then. The Li-polymer battery retains its 80% charge capacity even after completing hundreds of charge cycles. The battery also complies with the highest safety standards, which makes it radiation proof. During our usage, the laptop lasted for slightly over 6 hours, under heavy usage and it gets charged from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours, which is rather good.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<div id="attachment_2407" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-image-2407 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ASUS-F556UA-AB54-NB-15.622-FHD-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop Review" width="550" height="393" /><p id="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Asus F556UA emerges as winner when it comes to processing power, quality entertainment and leveraging healthier experience but fails to impress people with storage capacity.</p>
<p>The top-notch performance with audio-video output is going to win hearts and make people crave for more and more. We are pretty impressed with Asus F556UA when it comes to audio-video experience; we love the way it makes it easier for people to continue binge-watching movies without feeling restrained.</p>
<p>Like every other laptop in market, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is also not the perfect laptop. It has little dim display and the storage provided on the laptop is also not adequate for most of the users but if you&#8217;re fine with these cons then it is one of the best laptop you can buy in $700 price range.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design and built quality of the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, the notebook comes with <strong>grey matte finished chassis</strong>. The laptop resembles most of the other laptops in the segment and is recessed inside a plastic chassis. On the top, the laptop comes with a gunmetal grey slab with Dell’s logo recessed in the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2302" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-image-2302 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-13-5000-2-in-1-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378 13 5000 2 in 1 Laptop - Design" width="600" height="404" /><p id="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop (Gun Metal Color)</strong></p></div>
<p>It sports a 13.3-inch display and comes with a <strong>backlit enabled chuckle keyboard</strong>, which is very well designed for all forms of usage. The trackpad is also very well placed and is comfortable to use. On the either sides of the laptop, you have one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a charging slot. Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with dimensions of 325 x 224 x 20.4mm, which makes it a slim offering in the segment. Also, the laptop <strong>weighs just 3.4 pounds</strong>, making it a perfect portable and easy to carry around laptop, which is <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students – Pro Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most suited for college students</a>, business men or anyone who wants powerful and lightweight laptop for their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2303" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-image-2303 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Different-Modes.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Different Modes" width="700" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1. Tent Mode | 2. Stand Mode | 3. Tablet Mode</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, getting deeper into the convertibility and ergonomics of this laptop, it comes with an innovative <strong>360-degree hinge</strong>, which adds on to the versatility and comfort of usage. The laptop allows you to switch easily between four different modes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tent mode</span> is perfect for using recipes in real time, this mode is also perfect for video calling your friends and family while working on something. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand mode</span> of this convertible notebook is meant for movies on the go. The typical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop mode</span> is meant for most of your routine work that you&#8217;d do from your laptops such as <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on word documents</a>, writing emails, and more.  Finally, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tablet mode</span> makes reading easy while you’re leant or reclined.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop sports a <strong>13.3-inch Full HD display</strong>, which comes with a new design emphasised on more screen and less bezel. This not only gives a larger display but also provides a wide-angle display. The display panel on the device is a TrueLife LED-backlit touch display, which provides a brilliant wide-angle view. The laptop’s screen comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving it a sharper image quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-image-2305 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-convertible-display.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 convertible laptop - display" width="800" height="553" /><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>13.3 Inch Full HD Touchscreen Display with 1920 x 1080 Resolution</strong></p></div>
<p>The laptop’s display is not the brightest you get in the segment, and we felt that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was quite dull</span>. The laptop’s sunlight legibility isn&#8217;t the best, and the blacks on the display weren&#8217;t accurate as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre. All in all, the laptop’s display is surely a worth considering drawback of the notebook. However, its touchscreen functionality works absolutely fine in almost all the use cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as aforementioned offers a good set of specifications and hardware for the asking price.</p>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, speaking about the actual innards of this laptop, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with a handsome set of hardware and features. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, the processor can achieve a clock speed of 3.10GHz, which makes it very easy for the device to handle heavy games and apps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i5 Processors (New 2017 Kaby Lake Laptops)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive <strong>1TB of hard disk with 5400RPM</strong>, which is another attractive feature for the price segment it comes under. It also houses Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor to handle all the graphic related content.</p>
<p><em>Like most of the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small convertible laptops</a>, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop also <strong>doesn&#8217;t house a CD/DVD drive</strong> with it.</em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Dell Inspiron i5378 sports a 720p camera, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. Although the images captured using the laptop’s webcam are kind of grainy, the video calls made are serviceable. The colour reproduction is accurate and a camera does manage to capture a lot of details in the images.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the laptop’s <strong>webcam uses infrared technology to bolster facial recognition</strong>. It&#8217;s actually very hard to find facial recognition in laptops at this price range, which is again a very good aspect of the laptop.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Like all other Dell Inspiron 5000 series of laptops, the 2-in-1 i5378 also comes with a good set of ports to support additional peripheral devices and to make the most of a laptop. Speaking of the ports, the laptop houses <strong>one USB 2.0 port</strong> for your regular usage, <strong>two USB 3.0 ports</strong> for enhanced data transfers and added functionalities when you connect any peripherals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY - Ports and Slots" width="519" height="334" />The laptop also houses a full sized <strong>HDMI port</strong> to connect to any display devices. As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Dell Inspiron also houses a <strong>Micro-SD card reader</strong> slot to connect with an SD card. We would have loved the USB Type-C port and we hope that Dell will include it, may be in their next generation 5000 series convertibles?</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY runs <strong>Windows 10 64-bit Home</strong> variant right out-of-the-box. Windows 10 is absolutely the most productive OS in the contemporary world and evidently, doesn&#8217;t need an introduction in the field of laptops. It is not just productive but is also the most common, easy-to-use, reliable, and an OS with the highest number of compatible apps for laptops.</p>
<p>Like all the latest Inspiron laptops, the current laptop also comes with a set of useful apps, readily installed with the laptop. These includes <em>Dell’s SupportAssist</em> app, which is a fairly useful app to provide the right tech support in case of troubleshooting. The <em>Dell Update</em> app makes sure the laptop runs on the latest OS and has all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the other apps which come preloaded with the laptop, there is some <a title="Software bloat - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloatware</a> includes such as DropBox, Royal Revolt 2, Facebook, Netflix, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Twitter, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, and Houzz. Some of them are useful but others can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>laptop comes with a one-year warranty</strong></span>, like most of the other laptops. However, Dell’s after sales support is far better than that of most of the other brands.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to the latest <strong>Kaby Lake (7th Gen)</strong> Intel Core i5-7200U Processor clocked at up to 3.10 GHz, the new Dell Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop runs utterly smooth in almost all the everyday essentials such as handling apps, using for multimedia purposes, gaming, and more. The processor is paired with a good <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which makes the laptop able to handle multitasking with ease. During our review, we tested the laptop with multiple apps running simultaneously, to which the laptop responded really well. Although there was a very minute lag, it was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>For multitasking, we tested the laptop by running benchmarking apps in the background, Google Chrome with up to 15 tabs opened simultaneously, music in the background, and with a constant connectivity to the internet. The laptop was hardly warmed even after 1 hour of such extensive usage session.</p>
<p>During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good <strong>62,482</strong> on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. On Geekbench 4, the laptop scored <strong>6800</strong> which depicts the overall system performance with a stress on graphics reproducibility. These numbers are pretty impressive for a <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops in $500 - $600 Price Range" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop priced just little above $500</a>.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics bolstered by the <strong>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor</strong>. Although the laptop does have a decent set of specifications, it is not meant for extensive and heavy gaming with high graphics and is, therefore, not a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily gaming stationed laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Although the laptop is not meant to handle heavy games such as GTA V, Battlefield, or the DEUS EX in their highest graphics mode, most of the games like the Counterstrike, heroes of the Storm, and Shadowman were still pretty much playable when the graphics set to low/medium.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop can although handle games and graphic-intense apps to an extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s not for the people whose primary concern is gaming</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with <strong>two built-in Stereo speakers</strong>, which are powered by MaxxAudio technology, for better all round sound. The speakers do a great job in providing decent audio output and also doesn&#8217;t turtle at the volume set to maximum. We played high-quality FLAC files on this laptop and the output was just as loud and clear as expected.</p>
<div id="attachment_2308" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-image-2308 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop Review" width="600" height="574" /><p id="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>High resolution display and 2-stereo speakers makes playing games and watching movies fun</strong></p></div>
<p>As far as playing videos, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop can handle HD, Full HD, 2K, and 4K videos without an issue</span> and thanks to the wide-angle screen, watching videos and movies on this 2-in-1 convertible is fun and convincing.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5378 2-in-1 is a powerful laptop with a decent set of specifications including a Full HD display. As for the battery life, the laptop stays juiced up by a 3-cell, 42 Whr battery pack. During our review, the laptop lasted for around <strong>6 hours of continuous usage</strong>. The battery backup is not the greatest considering other similar laptops in the segment delivering 8-10 hours of battery backup. The laptop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">takes about 3 hours to get charged</span> from 0 to 100.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1937" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY 13-Inch FHD Laptop" width="550" height="350" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-300x191.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />Dell Inspiron i5378 is definitely a power-packed convertible 2-in-1 laptop, which you can get at this price. The laptop does have few pros and cons, but after an extensive review, we personally feel that the laptop has more advantages and benefits than that of its drawbacks. The <strong>dull display can be overlooked</strong> with its convertible feature. Mediocre battery life can be overlooked by its powerful performance.</p>
<p>All in all, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop</span> is definitely a must buy, if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop to flaunt with looks, portability, and performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ASUS ZenBooks have always managed to attract us. We&#8217;re not just saying in terms of the looks and design aesthetics, but in terms of overall performance as well. These laptops offer a lot of powerful hardware paired with futuristic features at a budget.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our current contender, the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54, is also launched with the similar expectations and is promised to deliver sturdy performance with an impressive list of specifications. On top of all this, the laptop comes in an all-metal finished shiny chassis, which also adds on the premium aspects of the laptop. All these priced at around $700 makes this a worthy contender in the current laptop’s market and thus, we&#8217;ve decided to review this for our audience. Drill down till the bottom of our review to know everything about this laptop.<span id="more-2020"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, almost all the ultrabooks these days looks akin to the Apple’s very own <a title="Checkout All MacBooks on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2kPOuqp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBooks</a> in terms of the overall form-factor and design. And the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 laptop is no exception in this case as well. There are a lot of similarities in the design of the ZenBook UX330UA and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple MacBook Air</a>. They are almost identical in size and weight and shares similar design hues, including chunkier bezels around the display, curved panel along the edges, and keyboard’s layout.</p>

<div id="attachment_2025" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2025" class="size-full wp-image-2025" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Laptop Design" width="513" height="600" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg 513w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-257x300.jpg 257w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-43x50.jpg 43w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Solid Aluminum Build</strong></p></div>
<p>Here come the other design aspects, which are not like the MacBook. The metal borders around the display are chunky and come with a large protective layer, which although looks a little awkward, but adds up to the protection of the device. The overall premium metallic shiny outer bezels on the laptop are through a layer of tiny metallic particles, on top of premium aerospace-grade aluminium, making it quite different from that of an all-metallic chassis of a MacBook.</p>
<div id="attachment_2026" style="width: 737px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-image-2026 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop Design" width="727" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design.jpg 727w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-610x420.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-600x413.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Asus UX330UA-AH54 weighs less than 3 pounds and is just 13.5mm thick!</strong></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the sides of the laptop, there are all types of ports and connectivity slots included on both sides of the laptop. We will discuss on ports and slots in more depth later in this review. On an overall note, the ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 certainly looks a lot better than most of its rivals in the segment and is surely an eye-catcher in terms of the overall design.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook sports a 13.3-inch wide-view anti-glare display protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. The display on the laptop is a LED matte panel which comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The display on the laptop is also bolstered by the IPS technology, known for providing clear and vivid display quality. The display on the laptop is a wide viewing angle which covers up to 178 degrees, for better viewing. The laptop offers a colour gamut of 72%, which is on par with most of the current display panels in this budget.</p>

<p>Moreover, during our usage, we never felt eye strains even after very prolonged usage, which is a very good aspect of this laptop. We also ran few benchmarks on the ZenBook and were surprised to look at how well the laptop’s display fares in real-time usage. In terms of brightness, the laptop offers 420 nits, which is adequate and bright even under direct sunlight. We noticed that blacks on the screen to be very accurate and punchy, which gives it the right depth of colour and image on the display.</p>

<p>All in all, the display on the Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 is really a strong point for the laptop.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware and configuration the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 offers, under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor, which comes with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz. However, the laptop can be rattled under its full potential of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. For application handling and multitasking, the laptop is provided with an 8GB of DDR3 RAM, which we felt to be a little outdated, considering its rivals having a DDR4 enabled RAMs. However, it&#8217;s the perfect blend of processor and RAM on this laptop, which didn&#8217;t let us down throughout our usage.</p>

<p>As far as the storage on this laptop concerned, it comes with a 256GB of SSD storage, which should suffice most of your data. The laptop comes with a fingerprint scanner, which is a unique feature in laptops. This not only adds up to the versatility of the laptop but also ensures safety and security of the user’s privacy. For the gaming and graphics related niches, the laptop comes with the latest integrated Intel HD 620 Graphics, which although isn&#8217;t as powerful as Nvidia but is surely capable of handling most of the daily graphic related usage.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook comes with an HD webcam and the camera on the laptop is strictly average. Even under bright lighting conditions, we felt the image on the display was blurry and murky. However, the camera is quick at adjusting the image on the display and is, therefore, manageable for occasional video calls.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being an ultrabook, the Asus Zenbook UX330UA doesn&#8217;t compromise on any connectivity options. Most importantly, it sports a 3.5mm audio jack which many laptop manufacturers are planning to get rid of.</p>

<p>The laptop offers two USB 3.0 ports for faster, efficient, and reliable file transfers and a <a title="USB Type-C Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USB Type-C port</a> to deliver up to 10 times faster data transfers. In addition to them, this laptop also comes with a USB Charger+, a Micro-HDMI port, and a Micro-SD card slot.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Ultra-Slim Laptop runs Windows 10 home out-of-the-box. The software on the laptop works just fine as that of any other laptop running Windows 10. The software on the laptop is productive, efficient, fast, and reliable but has its own drawbacks. The laptop is stuffed with some bloatware, which we felt was quite unnecessary for most of the users.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the ZenBook comes stuffed with a latest seventh gen intel core i5 processor paired with an 8GB of RAM. This duo is now commonly seen on most of the latest laptops at this budget. Although these specifications are any groundbreaking, they certainly offer very reliable and stable overall performance. The RAM and system memory is very well managed in this ultrabook.</p>
<p>During our usage, we&#8217;ve put the laptop to its full potential. We ran multiple RAM and processing power consuming benchmarking apps to which the laptop responded really well. Switching between apps, multitasking, gesture support, and other essential performance aspects on this laptop are pretty convincing. During our entire usage, we hardly noticed a performance issues. In fact, we loved how the laptop responded to the heavy applications.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Speaking about the gaming aspect of the laptop, it comes with an integrated Intel HD 620 graphics, which is one of the most advanced graphics integrated with an Intel chipset. The graphic reproduction and handling of the laptop are pretty neat and tidy. Although one cannot expect a powerful gaming experience on this laptop, almost all the modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook 3 is unarguably a multimedia-stationed laptop. This aforementioned statement is bolstered by its powerful Harman Kardon audio paired with ASUS’s proprietary Golden Ear team to produce an unmatched and unsurpassed distortion-free sound. The laptop comes with the SonicMaster technology for tuning audio and sports a 4-Channel, 5-magnet enabled, Quad-Speakers for a powerful audio experience.</p>
<div id="attachment_2031" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2031" class="wp-image-2031 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop.jpg" alt="Harman Kardon Audio on Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop" width="611" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop.jpg 611w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-300x196.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-610x399.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-600x393.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Ultimate Sounding Speakers by Harman Kardon</strong></p></div>
<p>Moreover, the laptop also comes with a smart-Amp audio technology option, which lets you setup the audio as per the user’s choice. Speaking about the video playback abilities, the laptop can play 4K content with ease, and thanks to its super wide viewing angles, watching videos on this laptop is a pleasure.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Speaking about battery life of the ASUS ZenBook, the laptop is fuelled with a 57 Wh polymer battery pack. The battery packed in the laptop is pretty much sufficient to provide a backup of around 5-10 hours based on the usage. The laptop can be fully charged in around 2 hours 30 minutes. During our review, the laptop survived for 8 hours in video playback test, where we played 4k content with around 40% of brightness. Do note that, these figures can increase or decrease based on the usage. On a conclusive note, the battery could have been much better for a laptop this calibre as the MacBook Air with the almost similar set of configuration lasts at least 3 hours more than our current contender.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1932" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54-Best-Ultrabook-Under-$700" width="550" height="320" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-300x175.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-515x300.jpg 515w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />With all that said, we’d like to conclude saying that the ASUS ZenBook is undoubtedly one of the most polished and performance-oriented laptops in the segment. The laptop has few weaker zones, but thankfully, it also has a lot of other aspects which are very well-tuned making it an able <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contender in around a budget of $700</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for an eye-catchy premium looking daily performer, then the ASUS ZenBook is surely a worth considering option. Also note that there are hardly any able laptops in this price range and you&#8217;ll need to spend few hundreds additionally to get a better option such as Dell XPS 13, or the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the HP ENVY 13-ab016nr is a premium looking laptop, which is very sleek and ergonomic. The Envy 13 comes with a completely refreshed design aesthetics and looks simply irresistible measuring 8.9 x 12.8 x 0.6 inches. Like the legendary, MacBook Pro, the laptop is completely recessed in an aluminium chassis but is pretty light, and weighs just around 3.3 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1986" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Review" width="300" height="280" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review-50x47.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At the first glance itself, we could see a lot of similarities between the Envy 13 and a MacBook. Although there are certainly remarkable differences in the design and built, the similarities are very evident. The laptop’s lid comes with black bezels, giving a better highlight to the screen. The laptop maintains a uniform thickness throughout the built, which is very remarkable in the laptop these days. The laptop comes with a lifted hinge, which provides its users with a better and more comfort in typing.</p>
<p>Speaking about other sides of the laptop, to the left there is a charging port, an SD card reader slot, a USB Type-C 3.1 port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. To the right, there are two more USB ports and an HDMI port. The keyboard and the trackpad are also very neatly and spaciously recessed. You also get speaker grills, on the either sides of the keyboard, which thumps the volume directly without any distortion.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The HP ENVY 13-ab016nr laptop sports a 13.3 inch diagonal full HD UWVA eDP display. The display is powered by a bright view WLED-backlit technology and comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.</p>
<p>The laptop’s display offers the company’s proprietary Technicolor Color Certification, to deliver true-to-life colors. Although the display offers vivid, bright, and great color gamut, it feels glossy and this affects the viewing angles of the laptop. Due to the glossy coat on the display, the screen is highly reflective, making it tough to use it in bright outdoor conditions. However, we did not face any hiccups with the display during our indoor usage. Moreover, the blacks on the screen are not very punchy, as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1989 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13 ab016nr Notebook Display" width="649" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display.jpg 649w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-300x231.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-610x470.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-600x462.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" />We also ran few benchmarking apps and tools on this laptop, to which the laptop did fare well. It managed to reproduce 94 percent in the sRGB color gamut, which is very good considering the price range. When it comes to the brightness of the screen, it managed to score 410 nits of brightness.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13- ab016nr Notebook, boasts of some really interesting set of specifications under its chassis. The laptop being one of the latest in the market, does come with all the latest lineup of configuration.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the HP Envy 13 is powered by a latest seventh gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 2.5 GHz, but can certainly obtain a full throttle of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. This mode can not only provide you with a punchy performance but also lets you get the most out of the laptop. For handling apps and multitasking, it is equipped with an 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM, which although is not the best you can get in the market, but it certainly is good enough to provide a smoother multitasking.</p>

<p>For all the <a title="Gaming Laptops - Archives" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming and graphics enthusiasts</a>, the laptop is stuffed with an Intel HD 620 graphics, which is good, if not the great. Graphics on this laptop worked well during our review, provided we have our expectations checked.</p>
<p>And finally, now comes the predominant part of the hardware of any laptop—the storage. The HP envy 13-ab016nr laptop offers a 256GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 Solid State Drive, which we feel is a little less and could have been much better if it was anything beyond 500GB. However, the solid state drive is fast, efficient, and more reliable than hard drive for the cause.</p>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13-ab016nr comes with an HP web camera recessed on top of the screen. The webcam provided with the laptop is bolstered by the HP’s proprietary TrueVision HD Webcam. TrueVision, allows you to get vibrant clarity and very good color gamut during the video call sessions, and can also aid in clicking pictures using the laptop. The camera is decent to work with and can also work well in low-lit conditions. All-In-All, the webcam on the Envy 13 does beyond satisfaction being a laptop’s camera.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook sports 3 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports for reliable, and lightning fast data transfers. They also aid you in connecting peripherals with the laptops easily. It also sports an HDMI port and one DisplayPort to extend the display onto another device.</p>

The Envy 13 also comes with a Micro-SD card reader slot to connect with an SD card.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13 laptop runs Windows 10 out of the box. Windows needs no introduction in the field of laptops as it is the most common, productive, easy-to-use, and reliable OS for laptops. Accordingly, the HP Envy 13 also offers a great UI, thanks to the latest Windows 10, and it also offers all the interesting features of the Windows 10 including Connect with Cortana. Cortana is your new personal assistant in Windows 10 based machines and this works perfectly well with the HP envy 13 ab016nr notebook.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1994" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Software" width="945" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software.jpg 945w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-300x159.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-768x406.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-610x323.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-600x317.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" />During our review, we faced no issues of hurdles in using Cortana and the laptop was able to identify proper voice commands from us. It also helps in setting reminders, alerts, setting plans, and more, all making it even more productive and fun to use. Some of the additional software which come preloaded are CyberLink PowerDirector, Netflix, and McAfee LiveSafe which can be easily uninstalled if not required.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Thanks to the 7th Gen Kaby Lake intel core i5 processor, the laptop does provide seamless performance in almost all instances. Although you can get a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops with Intel Core i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop powered by intel core i7</a> at this price, it is the generation of processor, which makes a difference here. Kaby Lake series of processors from Intel are undoubted, power-packed processors, and are also very power efficient when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<p>The good 8GB of RAM and the processor runs the show for the Envy 13 and runs really well. During our review and usage, we hardly noticed any issues in the perspective of performance of this laptop. We also throttled the laptop to its limits by running a number of heavy applications such as photoshop, games, and intensive benchmarking applications, and the laptop remained cool and calm, in performing these tasks. Chrome runs absolutely fine even with around 10-15 tabs opened simultaneously, the transition effects, Cortana’s usage, app switching, multitasking, background resource utilities, everything is just perfect with the HP Envy 13-ab016nr, and is, therefore, the most stylish and powerful laptop in its segment.</p>

<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, it isn&#8217;t any groundbreaking in this segment. Most of the common games run fine on this laptop, but it struggles in handling graphic intensive games when the graphics are set to maximum. Modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the laptop comes with dual stereo speakers on either side of the keyboard. The sound is clear and thanks to the placements of the speakers, the sound is forward stationed and doesn&#8217;t have any distortions like the laptops having speakers beneath or to the side of the chassis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="274" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers.jpg 960w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-300x86.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-768x219.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-610x174.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-600x171.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />The audio on the laptop is tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen and booming HP Audio Boost, which pretty much pairs up really well to provide a quality sound output. Also, all forms of videos, 4K, UHD, Full HD, and HD played well without stutter.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is another attractive feature of this laptop, thanks to the slim and sleek built, the laptop offers good battery life than most of its competitors. Although the company claims that the HP Envy 13-ab016nr can provide over 14 hours of continuous usage, in our review we found that it was able to stay alive for around 8-10 hours based on the usage. This is still way better than most of the laptops at its segment. The laptop is powered by HP’s Fast Charge technology, which can charge your device for 90% in just around 90 minutes.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1970" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook" width="500" height="338" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook.jpg 500w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook-300x203.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />All that said, we’d like to conclude our review saying that- you&#8217;ll not regret in the near future buying this <a title="Checkout Other Best Laptops Under $600" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop at this price of around $600</a>. If you want a slim, sleek, sturdy, and a well-built laptop which not only looks premium and good but is also capable of delivering outstanding performance, then look no further, the HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook is probably the best you can get. However, if you&#8217;re ok with carrying the same old chunkier laptops, then you might get some even more powerful laptops at this price range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS was one of the very first brands among all the traditional laptop makers, to step into the gaming arena and challenge the pioneers like MSI and Alienware series of laptops. It all started with the ROG (Republic of Gamers) series of laptops from ASUS, which was not only priced competitively but was also a very good all-around performer. Soon after the company started to earn fame and reputation in the gaming arena, it started to release a series of laptops with the primary emphasis on gaming to attract a large audience.</p>
<p>Our current laptop, the ASUS FX502VM Gaming Laptop is one among the newly launched gaming series of laptop from ASUS, which is now one of the most selling gaming laptops at around $1000. The laptop does pack in some interesting set of specifications and also packs in a lot of additional features. We were initially surprised to hear about the intelligent thermal design and several other futuristic features of the laptop and therefore, decided to have a look at it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1851" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Asus FX502VM 15.6 Gaming Laptop" width="750" height="519" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-300x208.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-610x422.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-600x415.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Here is our take on the ASUS FX502VM-AH51, so let’s just quickly drill down to the review.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM looks thick and hefty right from the very first look. However, the laptop is very finely engineered and ergonomically built. The laptop comes with a curved chassis as seen on the ROG series with imposed curves with an ASUS logo imposed on the lid. The laptop is thick at the centre and gradually gets narrower towards the edges.</p>
<div id="attachment_1852" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-image-1852 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png" alt="Asus FX502VM Gaming Laptop - Dimensions" width="469" height="550" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png 469w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-256x300.png 256w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-43x50.png 43w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t see gaming laptops this thin more often!</p></div>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15.4 x 10.5 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weights around 4.9 pounds, which although isn&#8217;t that hefty for a gaming laptop, still feels a little cumbersome to carry around.</p>
<p>Both the sides of the laptop are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The laptop comes in matte finished colour giving a perfect gaming hue to the users. As soon as you open the lid, you see a very aggressive looking futuristic keyboard. The keyboard on the laptop comes with red backlit keys, which adapts a theme according to the game we play. Moreover, the trackpad on the laptop is also spaciously arranged in the body, giving it a perfect ease of usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_1853" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1853" class="wp-image-1853 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Keyboard-Touchpad" width="800" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad.png 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-300x155.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-768x396.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-610x314.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-600x309.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Touchpad-50x26.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1853" class="wp-caption-text">Chiclet keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys offers 1.6mm tactile key strokes.</p></div>
<p>All in all, the ASUS FX502VM comes with a finely engineered futuristic design. The laptop feels really sturdy but is, unfortunately, slightly heavy to carry around.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Our ASUS FX502VM features a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. With these numbers kept in mind, it is quite vibrant enough for movies and games. As soon as we started testing out the laptop, we played some 4K content on it, to which the laptop’s display responded really well. When watching a 4K trailer of injustice: Gods among us, all the colours popped up really well with high colour gamut. Moreover, the viewing angles on the laptop are also really great and can easily cover over 160-degrees without getting smudged.</p>
<p>Our lab tests also proved the ASUS FX502VM’s impressive colour performance. The laptop managed to produce 184.7 percent of the sRGB colour gamut, which is by far one of the best we measured. That not only means that this display is bright and colourful, but also means that it is accurate than most of its rivals in the price segment.</p>

<p>During our entire review and usage, we never ever felt that the display on the ASUS FX502VM was even a bit dim. It is bright, vivid, colourful, and wide. As far as the benchmarking numbers are concerned, ASUS’s notebook managed to register an average brightness of 289 nits on our light meter, which is an edging out figure for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware on ASUS FX502VM: It is powered by a sixth generation gaming-centric Intel core i5-6300HQ mobile processor clocked at 2.3GHz. For multitasking, the processor is paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM. The laptop comes with thermal cooling technology, and thus makes use of dual cooling fans, to prevent the innards getting warm even under heavy usage.</p>

<p>As far as storage on the laptop is concerned, it comes with a 1TB of hard disk, with an RPM of 7200. This not only ensures faster data transfers but also ensures of being a reliable data storage medium. Graphics on the laptop are handled by NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics coprocessor with a dedicated DDR5 memory of 3GB. This is the new Pascal architecture based GPU from NVidia. Hence, Asus FX502VM is a VR Ready gaming laptop and it can run all 360° games, videos and other VR content without any problems.</p>
<p>ASUS FX502 has a specially-designed chiclet gaming keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys that offer the users a large 1.6mm of travel distance. Greater the travel distance, better is the tactile feedback for keystrokes. In addition to that, the laptop also features highlighted WASD keys for user convenience. The keyboard on this laptop is undoubtedly best for gaming, but apart from that it can also be used by <a title="Top Recommended Laptops for College for Every Budget" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students for college</a> or by <a title="The Best Laptops for Computer Programmers for Coding/Programming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers for coding</a> and playing games.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The laptop sports an HD Webcam on top of the display. The camera on this laptop is not the best you get at this budget but is adequate enough to meet the basic requirements of a typical laptop’s webcam. Yes, you can make Skype calls, and can even take few selfies during your leisure. On top of that, there is nothing much to be discussed in this section.</p>
<h4>Ports</h4>
<p>ASUS FX502VM crams a number of useful and productively usable ports onto its small frame. On the left side, you&#8217;ll find a proprietary power port, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI-out, an audio jack, 1x mini Display Port, and a microSD card reader.</p>
<div id="attachment_1858" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1858" class="wp-image-1858 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Asus FX502VM 15.3-Inch Affordable Gaming Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="770" height="618" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 770w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-300x241.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-768x616.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-610x490.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-600x482.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1858" class="wp-caption-text">Extensive connectivity options on Asus FX502VM-AH51 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</p></div>
<p>The right side houses two USB 2.0 ports, which are more than good enough for most peripherals you might attach, but we wish there was another USB 3.0 so we could take advantage of the <a title="Shop External Hard Drives on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2htYAfG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fastest external hard drives available in market</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS FX502VM runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and is naturally, one of the flexible operating systems for laptops. The Windows 10, is not just good at UI but is also very productive. It has millions of apps, compatible with it and provides a deeper level of customizations to its users. Apart from all the standard lineup of Windows 10 applications and software, the ASUS FX502VM also packs in some of the ASUS’s proprietary applications of security and productivity.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with 1-year Accidental Damage Protection along with 30 days of Zero Bright Dot Guarantee, which is one of the most comprehensive coverages available for laptops. This gives you protection against accidental drops, spills and electrical surges of the laptop.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The laptop does deliver an outstanding performance in its class. Thanks to an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of hard disk drive, the laptop is surely a power-packed performer.</p>

<p>We personally feel that the laptop could have been even better if it had an SSD drive instead of HDD. During our usage, the laptop’s hard drive was reading data at 145MB/s and was writing at 135MB/s, so while nowhere near as fast as the SSD it&#8217;s clearly a decent 7200rpm model. Keeping the hard drive details aside, the laptop being a powerful gaming performer, can handle all the general daily essentials with ease. During our usage, we ran a couple of RAM consuming benchmarks, brewer with more than 15 tabs opened, music playing in the background, with a high-end game running in the background. The laptop was handling multitasking with ease and is a powerful, stable, and reliable daily performer.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, we can accolade the ASUS FX502VM for being a gaming-stationed laptop and to the fact that it is stuffed with the Nvidia’s latest GTX 1060 GPU (the main reason to get excited about this laptop). The laptop was able to handle Alien Isolation with all settings maxed out and resolution set to 1080p at an average 75fps. However, the laptop did face few hiccups at 188fps wherein the visuals dropped slightly.</p>
<p>We installed a long list of high-end games on this laptop, thanks to its massive 1TB of hard drive. We tested the laptop with our all time favourite The Witcher III, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm. The best part, the laptop was able to handle all these games with ease even with the graphics set to max. Surely, the laptop stands in its words- The best gaming laptop at the budget. So for all the gaming lovers out there who are slightly tight on budget, this is probably the best you can get.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, it is essential for the ASUS FX502VM to accommodate powerful, detailed, and loud stereo output. During our usage, we found the speakers are excellent and hold their ground. As we always mention, multimedia is one of the most vital aspects of any laptop and our contender is packed with dual HD stereo speakers with DTS tech-enabled, which does the task of providing punchy audio pretty well.</p>
<div id="attachment_1860" style="width: 866px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1860" class="size-full wp-image-1860" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review.jpg" alt="Powerful speakers and stunning display" width="856" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review.jpg 856w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-300x140.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-768x359.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-610x285.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-600x280.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Review-50x23.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1860" class="wp-caption-text">Asus FX502VM features audio by Ice Power</p></div>
<p>We tested the speakers with bass heavy punchy tracks such as no church in the west and power bass, to which the speakers on the laptop responded really well. We also tested the laptop with treble based cleaner tracks, to which it responded well again. The laptop can play all sorts of HD content including 4K with ease. After all, this packs in the latest Nvidia’s GTX 1060!</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM is juiced using a 4-cell Lithium-ion battery. After all our usage, all we can say is the laptop does provide an outstanding battery backup. That said, being a gaming-stationed laptop, we honestly, didn&#8217;t expect much from it. The laptop lasted for just over 4 hours under continuous gaming, which is still a decent backup for a laptop with this configuration and features. However, if you aren&#8217;t gaming continuously you can expect slightly better battery backup. The laptop can be charged fully from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Bottom line: <em>Are you a hardcore gamer but slightly tight on budget? Go for it blindfolded!</em></h3>
<p>With a price tag of around $1250, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASUS FX502VM 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</span> is undoubtedly our first choice, if you need a power-packed gaming machine. Moreover, there aren&#8217;t many laptops at this price point which is primarily meant for gaming. Although the laptop is not as powerful as the ASUS’s flagship ROG series of laptops or the MSI’s dominators, it still is a very efficient, reliable, and powerful all-round performer.</p>
