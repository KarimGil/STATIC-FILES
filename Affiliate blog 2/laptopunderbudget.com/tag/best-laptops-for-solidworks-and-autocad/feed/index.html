										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buying a business laptop or the laptop for school might be an easy task, but when it comes to buying a laptop for specific niches such as CAD and 3D modeling, you need to check a lot of different things. These are the kinds of works carried out by professional architects by using CPU throttling software like AutoCAD, Solidworks, and various other heavy applications. These softwares require a workstation-like powerful laptop with a stellar set of configuration. So, what are the important things to check in a laptop which will be used specifically for CAD by architects? And, what are the best laptops for CAD and 3D modeling available to buy in the market right now? Letâ€™s find them out.<span id="more-1717"></span></p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">Ideal Hardware Specifications of The&nbsp;Laptop for CAD&nbsp;Works</h4>
<hr>
<p>You might be thinking of spending over $1000 bucks and getting a powerful laptop with new six-core Intel i7 or i9 processor and latest&nbsp;Nvidia GTX or RTX GPU for CAD works, that would definitely work but CAD softwares such as&nbsp;Solidworks and AutoCAD do not actually recommend these CPUs and GPUs for running their softwares.&nbsp;What they recommend is, <strong>Intel Xeon</strong>&nbsp;series of processors and <strong>Nvidia Quadro or AMD Radeon Pro</strong>&nbsp;(formerly Fire Pro) series of GPUs&nbsp;because they are specifically designed for CAD, 3D modeling and rendering works.</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t the normal CPUs and GPUs, and they are not even used in normal laptops.&nbsp;These are the multi-core hyper threaded CPUs and GPUs which are found only on workstation laptops and they are optimized to run heavy applications.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Note -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"></p>
<p><em>The laptops with Intel i5 and i7 processors can also be used for CAD. In fact, they are the perfect options for students and the architects on budget. But,&nbsp;make sure that you buy the laptop with quad-core or hexa-core CPUs because dual-cores are considered to be very weak to handle CAD applications. You can find&nbsp;all the quad-core i5 and i7 processor model numbers and their detailed comparisons in our guides to buy the <a title="Buying Guide: Laptops with Intel Core i5 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops with i5 processor</a> and <a title="Buying Guide: Laptops with Intel Core i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops with i7 processor</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, if you are into 3D modeling and complex CAD works&nbsp;then we would recommend you to buy a portable workstation laptop for yourself. They will be costly, but all the CAD applications will just fly on those&nbsp;laptops (You will&nbsp;find them&nbsp;on our list of recommended laptops for CAD below).</em></p>
<p></div></div>
<p>Although CPU and GPU are the most important things to check in a laptop for CAD, there are many other things such as RAM, storage, and display which&nbsp;plays a huge role in overall performance and user experience of the&nbsp;laptop for CAD&nbsp;and 2D/3D modeling. So, let&#8217;s discuss each of them in detail&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAM &#8211; </strong>The amount of RAM&nbsp;installed on the laptop makes a significant difference in the performance of the laptop. Most of the CAD software vendors recommend minimum 8GB of RAM, but we&nbsp;think that&#8217;s for 2D modeling and basic CAD works. For 3D modeling and rendering, at least 16GB of RAM is necessary and if you have to deal with more advance work loads then you may need 32 or 64GB of RAM.</li>
<li><strong>Storage &#8211; </strong>For storage, SSD is&nbsp;strictly recommended in a laptop for CAD because its reading and writing speeds dramatically increases the overall performance of the laptop. You can choose&nbsp;the amount of storage as per your requirements and budget, but make sure it&#8217;s at least 512GB as CAD files are massive in size.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Display &#8211; </strong>The display is another crucial thing to check on a CAD laptop. The screen of the laptop should be glare-resistant&nbsp;with&nbsp;comfortable viewing angles and should also be color accurate. We recommend IPS display with full HD or 4K resolution for CAD and 3D modeling works because they are good at every&nbsp;aforementioned aspect.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you are an architect&nbsp;or a student in&nbsp;an architecture major, then these are&nbsp;the few important things to check before purchasing the&nbsp;laptop for yourself.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s have a look at few of the laptops which are hand-picked by our team of laptop experts to reduce your efforts in finding the best laptops for CAD from a lot. We will have a look at laptops in all budget constraints,&nbsp;from $600 budget laptops to stellar configured $3000 workstation laptops because not everyone would be able to afford those high-end workstation laptops, especially students. So,&nbsp;let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p>Tired of using Windows? Looking for an unmatched user experience with the worldâ€™s most refined and polished operating system? Then the New MacBook Pro 16&#8243; is undoubtedly an unmatched option if budget is not the problem.</p>
<p>The latest MacBook Pro 16 bundles all the right essential one would expect in terms of graphics, productivity, and most other vital aspects. It is powered by a hexa-core Intel Core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM. The laptop also offers a fast 512GB of SSD storage unit. As far as the graphics on this work machine is concerned, it comes with a 4GB of dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 5300M. All these powerful specs comes in a chassis that weighs just 4.3 pounds which gains it an upper hand when compared with other laptops in its segment.</p>
<p>Moreover, it can be configured with up to Intel Core i9 processor, 64GB of RAM, 8TB SSD and 8GB of latest AMD Radeon Pro graphics card, but all these options will run you over $6000 which is very steep. There are other options which offer similar specs at half the price, but they don&#8217;t come in such slim and lightweight form-factor.</p>
<p>What makes the MacBook unique is its macOS Mojave which offers the best resource utilization and the best-in-class battery backup of up to 10 hours of continuous usage. Thanks to all the aforementioned list of specifications Appleâ€™s latest MacBook Pro is ideal for both 2D and 3D CAD applications.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Thinkpad P53 is the latest addition to the Thinkpad&#8217;s P series of laptops from Lenovo. The laptop is well-known to provide a workstation-class performance along with a long-lasting battery backup. Speaking about the configuration of this laptop, it is powered by a <strong>six-core 2.6GHz Intel i7-9850H Processor</strong> coupled with a best in class 32GB of RAM. It offers 512GB of SSD for storage, but we would advise buyers to add another storage drive in one of its two empty slots inside.</p>
<p>Sporting a 15.6-inch Full HD display, the laptop offers great depth in colors and viewing angles, which is best for designing and drawing based applications such as CAD. Moreover, the display is also a perfect choice for multimedia. Additionally, the laptop offers a 6GB of <strong>NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3000 6GB</strong>&nbsp;dedicated graphics which is the most recommended and specially designed graphics processor for&nbsp;CAD works only.</p>
<p>Now comes the unique selling aspect of this laptop, its battery backup, which is the best we&#8217;ve ever seen on a stellar laptop like this. The laptop can run up to 13 hours even while running CPU throttling CAD applications. That&#8217;s really impressive, and hence Lenovo ThinkPad P53 is one of our most recommended laptop for CAD works, 2D modeling and for 3D modeling right now.</p>
