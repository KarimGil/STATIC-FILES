										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who wants a 17-inch laptop when you can get a similar performance from the ultrabooks these days? Well, this is not the case for everybody. Some people do prefer bigger display no matter what and are ready to trade portability for the little more real-estate and power that the large form-factor laptops have to offer. So, if you&#8217;re one of those and looking for the best 17-inch laptop for yourself, then here is a complete guide to help you make an informed purchase of your new laptop.<br />
<span id="more-2764"></span></p>
<p>Before you proceed with the list of our most recommended best 17 inch laptops, let&#8217;s discuss whether 17 inch laptop is the right fit for your requirements or not.</p>
<p>Remember? I told you, I will help you make an informed purchase.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s begin. Shall we?</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><p>In the process of hand-picking the aptest laptop for your use (and that too from the abundance of varieties), traits like processing power, response time, storage capacity and size may be the chief decision makers. Narrowing the list down to one can never be dependent on a sole characteristic.</p>
<p>But as ‘laptops’ are primarily preferred for their portability, one might say that the size of the laptop is one of the most important features to take into consideration. Well, the size of laptops can range from <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small 11-inch netbooks</a> to all the way up to large 17 inch laptops, and that might make you wonder, exactly what kind of usage is a 17 inch laptop fit for? For starters, there is no concrete answer to this, but I can draw a pretty good picture overall.</p>
<p>Consider a gamer, it would be immensely difficult to achieve a good gaming experience on a small display. Also, such kind of crowd cares much more about the performance than sleekness and design of the laptop.</p>
<p>Moreover, some old school folks don’t want to lose the ‘PC feel’, even on a handheld device. Even after the evolvement of miniature devices, it is still hard enough to find a decent machine with all PC capabilities in under 15 inches. At least, the one which won’t cost you an arm and a leg.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 10 Best Desktop Replacement Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-desktop-replacement-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Desktop Replacement Laptops of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Another good use of a 17 inch screen? A shared space. Gives you all the perks of a full-fledged desktop experience, minus the large room take up. Then there are some media artists and photographers who would rather bear a large-sized machine than squint their eyes to smaller ones while creating masterpieces.</p>
<p>So, having a larger laptop has its own perks from different perspectives, but certainly, it is not the right choice for everyone. For instance, imagine traveling with a 17 inch laptop and working on-the-go. Not so comfortable. Right?</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s your takeaway — If you&#8217;re planning to use your laptop from your home or office work desk and if you think that it will sit there probably most of the time, then yes, the 17 inch laptops will be the perfect fit for all your requirements. But, if you&#8217;re the one who has to travel a lot and have to work on-the-go then, 17 inch laptops are a big NO for you.</p>
<p>Traveling and working with such huge laptop on your lap is not at all comfortable and therefore I recommend you to buy a smaller 14 or 13 inch laptop for yourself. You&#8217;ll find a lot of powerful, lightweight and easy to carry laptops in that segment.</p>
</div>

<p>So, now if you have decided to buy the 17 inch laptop for yourself then start reading the list of our most recommended best 17 inch laptops below. It will guide you further to make an informed purchase of your new laptop.</p>
<p>Well, if you have changed your mind after reading the points above and now deciding to buy a smaller laptop for yourself, then don&#8217;t leave our site yet. Check out our <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to buy the mid-sized 14 inch laptops</a> and <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to buy the ultraportable 13 inch laptops</a>.

<p>If you&#8217;re a power user and don&#8217;t mind spending a few extra bucks, then this AMD powered laptop from HP does the tasks much faster.</p>
<p>Featuring a latest AMD Ryzen 5 processor with 12GB of DDR4 RAM and 256GB SSD, this high-performance laptop from HP is unarguably an excellent choice for hard-core users looking for large screen laptops. It can run new games and can also handle light video editing because it has powerful Radeon Vega 8 graphics. Moreover, the laptop weighs just 5.5 pounds which makes traveling with it in a backpack a lot easier.<span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> |</span><strong style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;<a title="Best Price on HP" href="http://tidd.ly/d32b0fd6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on HP</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="L2">2. HP Envy 17t <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Affordable High Performance 17 Inch Laptop</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://tidd.ly/56d1900a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5684 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/HP-Envy-17t.jpg" alt="HP Envy 17t affordable 17-Inch gaming laptop" width="550" height="350"></a></p>
<p>HP&#8217;s Envy series of laptops has always managed to attract the audience and draw the attention through its impressive set of features at affordable costs. The laptops come with all the possible best combinations of features and specifications; one would expect from a laptop, irrespective of the primary usage.</p>
<p>Our current contender, the HP Envy 17t, sports a brilliant 17.3 inch full HD touchscreen display that protects eyes from strains even after prolonged usage. A 720p webcam is present on the top bezel of the screen which is not the best you can get, but it is good for occasional video calling. The laptop provides all sorts of ports and connectivity options, and DVD drive is also provided, in case you need it. Apart from all these features, the laptop is also jam packed with all the latest and powerful set of hardware specifications, making it one of the most powerful contenders in its segment.</p>
<p>It is powered by the newest 10th generation Intel Core i7 processor with base clock speed of 1.8GHz and turbo clock speed of up to 4.9GHz. The powerful quad-core processor paired with 8GB of RAM handles multitasking on the device very smoothly. For storage, the laptop comes with 512GB of SSD which is fast and offers decent amount of space to store all your files and media.</p>
<p>Coming to the gaming performance, the laptop has Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU which is powerful, but it’s still an entry level GPU. Although it can run almost all the latest gaming titles at scaled down settings, still it struggles to deliver the smooth gameplay on some demanding titles.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this is the best budget 17 inch gaming laptop for the audience looking for a large screen, high-performance laptop at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>With a bigger screen comes bigger entertainment! This holds absolutely true to our current device, the 2019&#8217;s latest Dell Inspiron 3000 series laptop. It comes with a bright 17.3-inch HD+ display with a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels. The display panel is an LED-backlit enabled one and has an anti-glare coat on top. While it does provide decent viewing angles, still it&#8217;s certainly not the best for outdoor use as it does not get bright enough.</p>
<p>On the hardware front, this Dell Inspiron laptop bolsters a powerful 3.4GHz AMD Ryzen 3 processor with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of mechanical HDD for storage. Graphics on the laptop are backed by an AMD Radeon Vega 3 integrated graphics. The overall performance of the laptop is pretty smooth, and it runs all sorts of software, apps, and even games without any problems.</p>
<p>In spite of the laptop’s huge display, it manages to offer excellent ergonomics. The laptop comes with a <strong>weight near to 5.96 lbs and is just 0.9-inch thick</strong> which makes this one of the best 17 inch laptop for frequent travelers.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of buying a laptop with the large form-factor is, it provides more room to fit the hardware. Accordingly, this Dell laptop packs in a huge battery pack and is expected to last over 6 hours of continuous usage on a single charge! I think this is really impressive considering the price of the <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400 of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop which is near to $400</a>.</p>

<h3 id="L6">6. Alienware m17 <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best 17 Inch Gaming Laptop</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/alienware-17-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5768 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Alienware-m17-2019.jpg" alt="Alienware m17 2019 Gaming Laptop" width="550" height="344"></a></p>
<p>Alienware series of laptops from Dell is globally renowned for being the best gaming laptops and are very premium built. Accordingly, the new Alienware m17 is also made with premium materials and stuffed with all the latest hardware.</p>
<p>Talking about the build quality, the laptop is completely built using copper and magnesium alloy. The outer chassis of the laptop feels very durable and provides better grip and ergonomics. Of course, it has a 17-inch display. Well, to be more specific, it has a 17.3 inch IPS display with an anti-glare coating on the top. The display of the new Alienware laptops can get bright up to 400-nits, which is remarkable considering the other brand laptops in a similar price range. The beautiful display on the device is tuned at 144Hz to deliver rich gaming experience with a minimal 9ms response time, so pro-gamers, I think your hunt of best 17 inch laptops ends here.</p>
<p>Speaking about the hardware, the Alienware 17 R5 comes in a variety of different hardware options and can be bought even with the newest Intel Core i9 processor. But, that top-of-the-line model costs a lot, and it is not for everyone. The configuration that we recommend is, 9th generation Intel core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 6GB DDR5 graphics memory. For storage, you can opt for 512GB SSD. But if you want more, then it can also be configured with up to 4TB of SSD.</p>
<p>To say the least, the Alienware m17 is not the laptop that I would recommend to all the power users, because many other laptops offer a similar set of specifications and features at much-lowered prices. But, if you are the one for whom the looks are as much as important as the specs of the laptop, then the Alienware m17 is the best 17 inch laptop for you.</p>

<p>If you want a slightly affordable 17-inch laptop with the 4K display, then <strong>HP Omen 17</strong> is also a great option. For under $1500, you can get it with the Intel Core i7-9750H processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD. The display on the HP Omen 17 is a 4K IPS panel; however, it isn&#8217;t as bright and colorful as the above mentioned Aero 17. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still a good display for photo or video editing work and of-course gaming.</p>
<p>Apart from that, HP Omen 17 gets full marks for its tank-like build quality. However, that tough build quality comes at the cost of portability. Traveling with Omen 17 in a backpack could boor the shoulders as it weighs around eight and a half pounds. But, if you&#8217;re the person who will be using a laptop from one place all the time, then I think you won&#8217;t find any better laptop than this one, at least not at the price that it comes for. | <a title="Best Price on HP" href="http://tidd.ly/b383dc59" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on HP</a></p></blockquote>

First things first, <em>this is not a <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17-inch laptop </a></em>so if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop with the large display then probably this laptop is not for you. The Acer Predator Helios 300 has an impressive 15.6 inch full HD 144Hz IPS display which is decently color-accurate and bright panel. Playing games on this laptop is really an immersive experience, thanks to its powerful hardware, built-in stereo speakers and of course the display.</p>
<p>As far as performance is concerned, the Acer Predator Helios 300 offers a lot more than you&#8217;ll ask for the price. It is powered by a six-core Intel core i7 coffee lake processor which is paired with massive 16GB of RAM and when the performance of processor meets its Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, it produces an <strong>extreme thrust of power</strong> to handle anything you throw at it. No matter what game or software you try to run on this laptop, it will handle all of them without any problems.</p>
<p>The only thing where this laptop lacks is storage department. This laptop has 256GB SSD inside which is the only storage drive provided on this laptop. I know that&#8217;s very low and not at all suitable for the laptop which will be replacing a desktop but don&#8217;t worry <em>Acer has taken care of this!</em> Acer manufactured this laptop by leaving an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">empty storage drive bay</span> inside so that we can put in an extra drive and get more storage. Although this will cost you some extra cash, I think it&#8217;s totally worth it because there are no other laptops with better specifications than the Acer Predator Helios 300&nbsp;<strong>in $1000 price range</strong>.</p>
<p>Even after upgrading the storage of this laptop, the total cost will still remain under $1,100 which is not at all a bad deal for a desktop replacement laptop. isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<blockquote><p>The recently launched <strong>Lenovo Legion Y740 17&#8243;</strong> is a great alternative if you want a laptop with current gen specs. You can get it with the Intel Core i7-8750H and Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU for $1,799. That&#8217;s steep, but it comes with a 17-inch full HD 144Hz display which is more brighter and colorful than the one on the above mentioned HP Omen 17. Moreover, the whole package is packed inside a svelte looking all-metal chassis which weighs around 6 pounds making it easy to travel within a backpack. | <a title="Best Price on Lenovo" href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/zOLZ7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Lenovo</a></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Dell&#8217;s subsidiary, Alienware, was focused on making headlines, Dell decided to appeal more to the mass consumer at CES 2019, announcing a refresh to their budget-friendly G series gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The next-generation laptops, the Dell G5 15, G7 15 and G7 17, are set to receive upgrades to both its internal components and aesthetics, with the more affordable line of gaming laptops starting to look more like their Alienware cousins.</p>
<h2>Affordability and Power Packed In a 15-inch Chassis</h2>
<div id="attachment_5155" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-image-5155 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>Where most refreshes only touch up on the hardware side of things, Dell also changed up the aesthetics of their G series gaming laptops for 2019. Instead of their more subtle look, they&#8217;re starting to look more like <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/alienware-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware laptops</a>. Case in point, by default, the Dell G7 15 and G5 15 will both come in Deep Space Black color options, decked out with blue-colored accents. Finally, rounding out its look are ridges located right around the border, which Dell presumably put both for aesthetic and functional purposes.</p>
<p>Another laptop, the Dell G5 15 SE, is also available as an upgrade. It features the same specs as the Dell G5 15. However, it comes with an Alpine White chassis and a clear panel on the bottom of the system that showcases the cooling system, which Dell equipped with blue fans.</p>
<p>The key difference between the G5 15 and the G7 15 is that the latter is thinner and weighs less. At just 0.78 inches and 5.77 pounds, the Dell G7 15 has slightly different dimensions compared to the Dell G5 15, which tips the scales at 6.1 pounds and is at least 0.95 inches thick.</p>
<p>Both of these G series gaming laptops come packing with the latest Quad- and Hex-core Cofee Lake Intel processors, as well as mobile versions of NVIDIA&#8217;s RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can opt to upgrade the display of the latest G series gaming laptops. For more eye candy, users can choose a 4K UHD, OLED display. Meanwhile, for serious and competitive gamers, the G5 15 and the G7 15 comes with a 144Hz Full HD display panel as well.</p>
<h2>An Inexpensive i9-Powered, 17-inch Laptop That Packs a Wallop</h2>
<div id="attachment_5156" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-image-5156 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-3.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>From the more budget friendly G series gaming laptops, we go to the slightly more expensive, but still affordable, G7 17.</p>
<p>Weighing at 7.21 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Dell G7 17 is slightly bigger than its 15-inch brothers. Yet, at the same time, it&#8217;s also leaner compared to <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other 17-inch gaming laptops</a>. It also comes with the same Deep Space Black theme as its 15-inch varieties, and unfortunately, won&#8217;t be available in Alpine White.</p>
<p>Powered by the latest Intel Core i9 processor, the G7 17 is dramatically more powerful and faster compared to the G5 15 and the G7 15. However, other specifications, including the NVIDIA RTX graphics cards, which tops out with the RTX 2080, remains the same across all three (or four including the G5 15 SE) gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dell has limited the 17-inch laptop to a Full HD display. However, users can choose to have it equipped with a 144Hz screen for a smoother gameplay experience.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Dell announced that all of the refreshed G series gaming laptops will start shipping on January 21.</p>
<p>The Dell G5 15 will start at $999, with the thinner and lighter Dell G7 15 starting at $1,099, and the Alpine White Dell G5 15 SE being available as an upgrade option. Finally, the Dell G7 17 will start at a $1,379 price point.</p>
