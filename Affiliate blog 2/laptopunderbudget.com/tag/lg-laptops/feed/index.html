										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/lg-new-2-in-1-and-17-inch-gram-laptop-rumors/">talked earlier</a> about LG working on a new Gram 2-in-1 device that would be shown off at CES 2019. It seems that we were right and even though the product is &#8220;coming soon&#8221; according to the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/laptops/lg-14T990-UAAS8U1-ultra-slim-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a>, the LG Gram 2-in-1 is available for purchase at some retailers such as <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-gram-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-solid-state-drive-dark-silver/6318179.p?skuId=6318179" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BestBuy</a>.</p>
<p>The new LG Gram 2-in-1 comes with new hardware and is powered by the new Intel 8th generation processors. The new processors are based on the Whiskey Lake architecture. It is worth noting that even though the new LG Gram 2-in-1 is a versatile machine that can be used as a laptop and a tablet, there is no 4K option for the screen. The display is only 14-inches, and the screen size is not enough to appreciate 4K resolution, which might be the reason why LG is not offering the option.</p>
<p>The new LG Gram 2-in-1 comes with Gorilla Glass 5 and a 360° hinge design, but there are some drawbacks. The new model is 0.1 inches thicker than the previous one. The 2-in-1 weighs 2.53 pounds compared to the older one that weighed just 2.13 pounds. The difference is a minor one and is not a dealbreaker. I am sure that most users won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4944 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LG-Gram-2-in-1-in-standard-position.jpg" alt="LG Gram 2-in-1 in standard position" width="650" height="494" /></p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that even with the additional weight the device is still lighter than the 2018 Apple MacBook Air. Gram laptops are known for being some of the lightest on the market, and that is something that we are going to see in 2019 as well.</p>

<p>Talking about the battery life of the device, LG claims that it will last 21 hours, but that is under very specific conditions. We will have to test the device to see what the battery life is actually like, but if I were to venture a guess, I would say that it would last around 12-14 hours which is very decent indeed.</p>
<p>The device comes with a stylus which can be used to take advantage of the touchscreen. The stylus has 4096 levels of pressure and has tilt detection to give you a more natural feel when writing. LG claims that the stylus batteries will last up to 18 months which is very impressive even if they last a year.</p>

<p>The new LG Gram 2-in-1 is available right now for $1500, and for the money you get the Intel Whiskey Lake Core i7-8565U CPU, 512GB of M.2 SSD for storage, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1080p display. That might seem like a lot of money for a laptop, but you are paying for the portability and the lightweight. Not to mention the high-end specifications as well.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the new LG Gram 2-in-1 and whether or not this is something that you might be interested in buying for yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes the LG Gram 17 a headline today? After all, there is no shortage of thin, crisp notebooks or high performance power laptops in the market. Thanks to LG, their consumers do not have to opt for either/or anymore. It&#8217;s extremely unlikely to come by an ultrabook that has a tremendously wide display and adds value to portability as well. Due to which, most 17-inch laptops ever introduced have been crafted in a way that categorizes them as <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-desktop-replacement-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desktop replacements</a> only, and are built so as well. Other 17 inch laptops are more performance oriented and are shipped in bigger, bulkier molds. But LG has taken an initiative to look outside this pigeon hole.</p>
<p>The new LG Gram 17 is focused towards road runners who seek handiness in their everyday machine more than anything, but are somehow forced to settle for smaller displays. Or either have to sacrifice performance or power for a sharper output. LG has successfully found a middle ground and blended them both in the same package. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about LG&#8217;s latest innovation.</p>
<h3>Display and Exterior</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4776 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-Gram-17.jpg" alt="LG Gram 17" width="650" height="650" />So, the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/lg-new-2-in-1-and-17-inch-gram-laptop-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> have finally proven to be accurate. With a 17.3-inch screen 2560×1600 resolution, and 16:9 aspect ratio, the laptop weighs just 1.33 kgs. Thickness rounding to be 0.7 inches and protected by Corning Gorilla Glass NBT. In hindsight, the equipment comes closer to 13-inch and 15-inch laptops in terms of footprint and compactness.</p>
<h3>Power, Processing, and Battery</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see that to maintain a certain weight benchmark, LG didn&#8217;t cheap out while assembling the insides of the LG Gram 17. The device packs a quad-core Intel Core i7-8565U (Whiskey Lake-U) processor having a TDP of just 25 W, base frequency of 1.8 GHz and up to 4.6 GHz in the Turbo mode.</p>
<p>Complimenting the processor is a 16GB DDR4-2400 installed RAM along with a 512GB SATA SSD. The only thing that is missing is a discrete GPU that kind of rules out gaming enthusiasts as the target audience of this machine. It comes with an integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 graphics instead. Probably to avoid compromising its size and thickness.</p>
<p>The battery backup is as solid as the device itself and can give an average of up to 19.5 hours. But many techies are skeptical of this claim and think it&#8217;s going to leave them disappointed.</p>
<p>Handling the connectivity is a wireless network card 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth module, with three USB 3.0 Type-A ports, a USB Type-C connector that doubles as a charging port. There is also a dedicated power connector. The device also lacks a RJ45 jack for a network cable, which is a letdown, but does include a slot for the use of microSD memory cards</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>Looking at the price tag does leave us disheartened as it rules out another segment of users as the target audience: the budget users.</p>
<p>The starting price for this sleek machine is $1,699 and you can find it at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-gram-17-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-solid-state-drive-dark-silver%2F6318178.p%3FskuId%3D6318178%26intl%3Dnosplash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Best Buy</a> right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LG is making a breakthrough in the laptop market. The South Korean giant is best known for their A-grade electronics and smartphones. LG&#8217;s &#8216;Gram&#8217; series laptops have been adored mostly because of their light footprint and slim design. It is all the more exciting to find out that they are expanding the line and making a comeback with a bang. According to rumors, LG might just upgrade their Gram laptops and make a breakthrough with their large 17-inch and 14-inch 2-in-1 super lightweight laptops. The largest category of mainstream laptops is mostly sized around <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17-inch screens</a>. LG is taking that custom one step further. They are rumored to be making an effort to slim down these beasts which hadn&#8217;t been done until now.</p>
<p>The news first resurfaced on mobile tech site <a href="https://liliputing.com/2018/12/lg-gram-17-is-a-big-laptop-that-weighs-less-than-3-pounds.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Liliputing</a>, the LG Gram convertible and LG Gram 17 were seen in Best Buy listings on Monday. Now, this might not sound as much of an &#8216;innovation&#8217; but seeing that it weighs a little under 3 lbs, is definitely a game changer. Some are also saying that this might be &#8216;the first notebook&#8217; from any company to hold such a light form factor with such a large screen.</p>
<p>The BestBuy listing (that has now been taken down) also left us hanging with the prospect of a 14-inch 2-in-1 model of the new LG Gram. Here&#8217;s everything we know about these two machines:</p>
<h3>LG Gram 17</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-4752 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lg-gram-17.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="458" />LG Gram 17 laptop will supposedly be equipped with an Intel Core i7-8565U (Whiskey Lake) processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB solid state drive. Its selling price is set to be $1700 as per the rumors. Despite boasting a wide display, this slim machine weighs just 2.95 pounds and measures just 0.7 inches thick.</p>
<p>With a magnesium alloy body, the Gram 17 will have dimensions at 15 x 10.5 x 0.7 inches. Its refreshing to see that LG has not thrown in wide bezels to maintain the 17-inch mark and has the sharpest corners. Overall, the machine comes close to the size of a typical 15.6-inch laptop.</p>
<p>With the Gram 17, there is also a fingerprint reader in the mix and a backlit keyboard. It however leave us craving for Thunderbolt 3 support. But, it does come with three USB Type-A ports, an SD card slot and a USB-C port. As per the source, there is also support for Gigabit Wi-Fi and Ethernet adapter for wired connections.</p>
<p>The battery doesn&#8217;t disappoint and LG rates the Gram 17&#8217;s battery life to reach a 19.5 hours benchmark. Though with LG&#8217;s track record it&#8217;s highly unlikely for it to actually be the case.</p>
<h3>LG Gram 14 2-in-1</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-4753 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LG-Gram-14.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="337" />This tablet cum notebook weighs around 2.6 pounds with a 14-inch touchscreen display. For convertibility, there is a 360-degree hinge that lets you transform the computer in different modes- laptop, tablet, tent, or stand.</p>
<p>This bendback convertible is priced for $1,499 and includes support for the digital Wacom stylus input. Boasting a 1080p touchscreen display, the sleek laptop is equipped with an Intel Core i7-8565U CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.</p>
<p>The port selection on this one comes with two USB Type-A ports, a USB-C port, an HDMI port and headset jack, and a microSD card reader. A dedicated port for a power adapter eliminates the hassle of USB-C charging. The addition of a fingerprint reader will provide you a one step secure login mechanism. The magnesium chassis of the laptop is the major contributor towards the lightweight body. And somehow, the narrow bezels on this one hasn&#8217;t interfered with the placement of the HD webcam that is located above the display.</p>
<p>There is no official word on the release date yet. But judging from past events, LG might announce the unveiling of their new LG Gram laptops a week into the Consumer Electronics Show. Sale is anticipated sometime in the following months as well.</p>
