										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has been carrying their Spectre lineup like a shiny trophy since the past year. It has been the company&#8217;s paradigm for experimentation and demonstrating renewals and upgrades in their laptops. Well, the good just got better and the Spectre x360 13-inch and 15-inch both have been bestowed with remarkable features. The Spectre x360 will be departing 2018 with a set of whole new functionalities, an aesthetic design, a powerful battery life, and an improved security.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The exterior is more &#8216;Gorgeous&#8217; than ever</h2>
<p>HP has turned their stunning and artistic Spectre x360 laptops even more eye-pleasing by introducing a &#8216;gem cut&#8217; design. The &#8216;angular&#8217; edges as HP claims are not just there for the looks of it. The Thunderbolt-enabled USB-C port sits on the angled corner for better cable management and the power button is placed on the opposite corner.</p>
<div id="attachment_4445" style="width: 781px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4445" class="wp-image-4445" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rsz_hp-spectre-x360-gemcut.jpg" alt="2018 HP Spectre x360 New Angular Design" width="771" height="515" /><p id="caption-attachment-4445" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>HP Spectre x360&#8217;s New Angular Design | Image &#8211; PCWorld</strong></em></p></div>
<p>On one side of the chassis, you will see a small red switch that controls the web camera and is being called the &#8216;kill switch&#8217;. It can electrically disable the camera by actually removing the driver from Windows. Sound much cooler than taping it up right?</p>
<p>While the 13.3-inch display looks similar to its predecessor model, the bezels have been thinned from all directions but the top, which remains intact. Speaking of what&#8217;s intact, the convertibility is the same as the previous models. The displays flip over into tablet mode or into media mode depending on your preference.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The insides are remodeled for better &#8216;everything&#8217;</h2>
<h4>Spectre x360 15-inch</h4>
<p>The 15-inch model has received this pump majorly because of designers, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photographers</a>, <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops For Programming – A One Stop Shop Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers</a>, illustrators etc. Basically, the professional class users who value nothing more than an improved CPU and GPU performance.</p>
<p>For the RAM option in the 15-inch model, you can go up to 16GB and up to 512GB for SSD storage. The battery life, however, for the 15-inch variant is estimated to hit up to around 17 hours, maintaining a substantial gap from the 13-inch model.</p>
<p>The graphics have been replaced by HP from AMD’s Vega M to Nvidia. So, you would be deciding between Intel&#8217;s latest 8th gen quad-core and six-core processors. Respectively with a Nvidia GeForce MX150, or with a GTX 1050 Ti (Max-Q) option.</p>
<p>The GTX 1050 Ti option is going to be significantly more equipped than the Nvidia GeForce MX150 for gaming or <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video processing</a>. To cool off the machine after doing all the heavy graphics work, HP has added in bigger dual fans and radiators. No matter how impressive, HP Spectre is still not tough enough to compete with the pros like Asus ZenBook Pro 15 or the Dell XPS 15, but for only $1,389 worth of damage, it&#8217;s a more than good enough package.</p>
<h4>Spectre x360 13-inch</h4>
<p>HP is debuting the upgrade by claiming the “world’s longest battery life in a quad-core convertible” for their 13-inch Spectre x360. It means that for an average professional on a 7-hour working day, it can last for almost 3 days on a single charge. Now <em>that</em> is a brave claim to make. Considering that the battery remains the same as from the Spectre x360 (2017) at 60Wh.</p>
<p>HP’s flagship Spectre x360 13 convertible laptops have been recognized multiple times for their core strength and over the top performance. The 2018 update offers a whole lot more with the new Intel “Whiskey Lake” processor and an optional Intel eSIM LTE support. The RAM options go up to 16GB and SSD Storage up to 512GB (NVMe M.2) SSD. You can choose from both a FHD panel or 4K display. And, this decision will directly correspond to the claimed 22.5 hours of battery life. So you can either choose a jock battery with a 1080p display or a 4K screen and less battery life.</p>
<p>The display can be pumped to up to 400 nits, even with the new 1-watt panel technology. So, the new, energy efficient panel has calmed one of the most power-hungry components within a PC. The new display being both bright and color-accurate serves as the perfect eye candy.</p>
<p>If you hate snoopers, you also have the option to equip the device with SureView panel. It will reduce the visibility of your screen to nosy viewers on your left and right, hence preserving your privacy.</p>
<p>The 13-inch laptop is not as graphically gifted as the 15-inch variant and comes with Intel&#8217;s UHD Graphics 620 integrated graphics.  This gives you some room for basic media manipulation and some <a title="Top 8 Best Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light gaming</a> but not as much as <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pros would prefer</a>. But both versions can achieve up to 1-gigabit download speeds of Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Both the HP Spectre x360 13 and 15 will be available in November. You can order them from HP online or Best Buy with the 13-inch variant starting at $1,149.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP refers the latest unveiling of HP Spectre Folio as embracing the art of &#8220;manu<i>craft</i>uring&#8221;. The idea behind HP&#8217;s latest grandeur was to make <em>using laptops</em> more &#8216;comfortable&#8217;. They have emphasized towards its correspondence to a PC. Whether it be the look and feel, the <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portability</a> or the specs. Although it sounds quite customary, like every other hybrid convertible in the market, but there is a catch. It is encased inside a full grain leather surface.</p>
<p>According to HP, the wide acceptance and success of 2-in-1 convertible notebooks persuaded them to craft this design. Such laptops are usually targeted to fit in specific user domains. The HP Spectre thrives on the idea and can be adjusted into 3 different positions.</p>
<h3>Feel It!</h3>
<p>The motivation to experiment with the frame of the device was driven from the fact that it needs to feel more <em>humane</em>. Considering that your PC is your go-to buddy for your entire day whether you are a student or a working parent. Resting a cold plastic or metallic body on your lap is too outdated, monotonous and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Apart from the “whiff of ozone”, the traditional hard surface designs don’t really have a smell. Smell is more closely associated with the memory than any other sense. HP wanted to get around the fact and make the device feel more personal. Said Stacy Wolff, HP&#8217;s Global Head of Design.</p>
<p>She also mentions that the idea for a leather casing was also inspired by timeless everyday devices like camera and sewing machines. It was intended not just to provide a leather cover where you slid a metal device in, but to make it a part of the device entirely. The leather casing is directly latched to the laptop. There is no metallic body or surface underneath the supple leather casing and no metallic hinge either.</p>
<p>The versatility of the device is also tailored to market to unisex consumers. Giving off a classy and professional feel, the device can go with a bomber jacket as much as with a handbag.</p>
<p>HP has not used the idea of a leather exterior just as a marketing gimmick but has fully embraced it as an integral part of their gadget which is kind of a go big or go home standpoint.</p>
<h3>Carry It!</h3>
<p>With the concept of a leather casing earning HP major points, it is all moot if the gadget lacks the comfort for usage.</p>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio is bendable into 4 different positions. The embedded forty magnets are sturdy enough to fully support the device in any flexible position.</p>
<p>The on ‘top of the lap as a notebook’ position, tilted up for a cinematic aura, the plain flat surface tablet position and of course,  closed as a stylish leather folder.</p>
<p>HP asserts that by only slight one handed movements, the device can be transformed into different positions almost effortlessly. Even on a tilted angle (up to about 135 degrees), the device maintains a sturdy stature during touching and tapping gestures. Moreover, there are no hinges, buttons or locks to fiddle with to set the positions.</p>

<p>The versatility in the positions is aimed to fit the needs to different consumers. Propped up for media playing, flat out for sketching and drawing and the classic lap-top style for typing.</p>
<h3>Accessorize It!</h3>
<p>To spruce things up a bit, you can always compliment the gadget with some classic accessories.</p>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio can be coupled with an <a href="http://tidd.ly/93075c92" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP Tilt pen</a> for <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/">seamless writing and smooth drawing</a>. For orders now, you will be able to avail the stylus with a 15% discount too!</p>
<p>Another add-on can be the <a href="http://tidd.ly/39105365" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP Spectre Rechargeable Mouse</a>. A sleek silver, smooth finish prop that can be synced with up to 4 devices with easy switching. To add another plus besides its sleek finish, the gimmick can last up to 11 weeks on a single charge. Sounds like a perfect companion.</p>
<h3>Pre-Order It!</h3>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio will be available in 2 modern colors;  Cognac Brown and Bordeaux Burgundy.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the HP Spectre Folio have begun from October 1, 2018, at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-spectre-folio-2-in-1-13-3-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-cognac-brown%2F6301872.p%3FskuId%3D6301872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BestBuy.com</a> and <a href="http://tidd.ly/d7902d1b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP.com</a>.</p>
<p>The device is expected to be available in Cognac Brown with an Intel® Core<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> i7 processor and 13.3-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080) IPS WLED backlit touchscreen, from October 29. The laptop will be available in a few different variants in terms of both body and specifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognac Brown with an with Intel’s 8th-gen dual-core Amber Lake Core i5-8200Y processor for a starting price of $1,299.99. It will come with a 1.3GHz base frequency and a 3.9GHz Turbo Boost mode.</li>
<li>Cognac Brown with an Intel’s 8th-gen dual-core Amber Lake Core i7 8500Y processor and LTE for a starting price of $1,499.99. It has a 1.5GHz base frequency and a 4.2GHz Turbo Boost mode.</li>
<li>Bordeaux Burgundy is expected to be available in late December.</li>
<li>The 4K panel option for the HP Spectre Folio is expected to come out late in December.</li>
<li>The stylish HP Spectre Folio Pouch and the HP Spectre Folio Sleeve are to be up for sale at HP.com in November for $49.99 and $69.99 respectively</li>
</ul>
<h3>But should you really buy It?</h3>
<p>Usually, devices targeted to <em>look pretty</em> or to be more specific &#8211; sleek and portable are not taken quite seriously by hardcore techies.</p>
<p>So far, it doesn&#8217;t look to be the same case with HP Spectre Folio. The 400 nits of brightness and a 13-inch, 1920×1080 unit seem pretty decent. Moreover, HP claims for the device to run for 18 to 21 hours on a single charge. This means to go about your entire day without a charger, and then some.</p>
<p>Having admired the interiors of the device, it seems like HP is pushing too hard for the device to be flagged as &#8216;premium&#8217;. HP is clearly experimenting with  Folio and trying to step out of their comfort zone. Sound quite similar to the attempts made by Microsoft to dominate the &#8216;premium laptop&#8217; market that Apple has ruled since forever.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would definitely try it.  Given the versatility of both the interior and exterior of the gadget, seems like a safe bet.</p>
