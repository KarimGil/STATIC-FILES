										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven’t been living in a cave for the past decade, you’d know how the use of personal computers has evolved over the years. With giant PCs (which took up more than half of your desk space) almost turning obsolete, the tech market is flooding with range of powerful and best 11 inch laptops which might be just the kind of machines this generation needs.</p>
<p>Now that I have acknowledged the significance of portable computers, I might just add that the evolution of laptops is continuously pushing towards more sleek, slim and power-efficient designs. At some point you might have felt the need to have a feather light, compact laptop&nbsp;that you could carry around without having to worry about the ‘extra baggage’. The one which doesn’t urge you to stay confined in a single place just because traveling or moving around with a bulky laptop is too much work.</p>
<p>If you are even slightly convinced with the idea that I am trying to put forward, then here is the full fledged laptop buying&nbsp;guide to buy the&nbsp;<em>best 11 inch laptops</em>&nbsp;which will surely help&nbsp;you to buy the best ultraportable laptop for yourself.<span id="more-2048"></span></p>
<p>Before we proceed with the list of best ultraportable 11 inch laptops,&nbsp;here&#8217;s an overview of the hardware specifications and performance that you can expect from the ultraportable 11-inch laptops. Please go through it otherwise you might end up buying the wrong laptop for yourself!</p>

	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><p>The 11 inch laptops are undoubtedly the best ultraportable laptops for web surfing, editing documents, watching movies and for everything in between but they aren&#8217;t made for power users. You cannot play games or do <a title="Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo editing</a> or <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/">video editing</a>&nbsp;work on these laptops because most of the 11 inch laptops are powered by&nbsp;Intel Celeron or Intel Pentium processors. These are very <em>low powered&nbsp;processors</em>&nbsp;from Intel&nbsp;which are specifically designed&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="The Best Netbooks and Chromebooks under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netbooks and Chromebooks categories of laptops</a>. Hence, the laptops with 11 inch display&nbsp;may not be capable enough to handle the most intense and demanding tasks but they are best in terms of portability&nbsp;and versatility with reliable performance and battery backup.</p>

<p>Apart from low powered CPU, the 11 inch&nbsp;laptops also lacks behind in offering sufficient amount of storage for most of the user&#8217;s requirements. Most of the&nbsp;11 inch display laptops&nbsp;offers 16, 32&nbsp;or 64GB of eMMC storage which is very low but there&#8217;s always an option to store files on&nbsp;cloud or expanding the memory via&nbsp;an SD card slot.&nbsp;Well there are some&nbsp;11 inch laptop models with&nbsp;128GB SSD and even 500GB&nbsp;HDD but they&nbsp;are very rare and on the side note,&nbsp;<strong>hard drives also tend to make the laptops a little heavier</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking for a ultraportable laptop for normal requirements which is&nbsp;easy to carry around and work on the go then yes, 11 inch laptops are best for you and you can start reading&nbsp;the list of our top recommended best 11 inch laptops&nbsp;below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best 11 Inch Laptops &#8211; Top Picks</span></h2>
<h3>1. Dell Inspiron 3000 11.6&#8243; 2-in-1 Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/laptops/new-11-2-in-1/spd/inspiron-11-3195-2-in-1-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5750 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dell-Inspiron-11-3000-2019-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 3000 2-in-1 11.6 inch Laptop" width="550" height="350"></a></p>
<p>When it comes to resilient convertibles, DELL is the only empowering name that emerges from the horde of PC manufacturers, mainly due to the ingenuity and efficiency that they are known to bring to the table.</p>
<p>For this particularly affordable model, the pros are definitely the light, classy chassis. To add more points to its overall performance, it is powered&nbsp;with the latest generation AMD A9 processor that operates at a speed of&nbsp;2.6GHz. Considering the price, it is not a bad deal to go with&nbsp;as the dual core processor can take up friendly tasks quite efficiently and a little bit of advance processing as well. Moreover, the built-in CPU is robust enough for standard stuff like video streaming, media editing, illustrating, so on and so forth. The 11 inch display is not only impeccable but also allows seamless touch-sensitive navigation between laptop and tablet-mode.</p>
<p>The cons? Non-upgradable RAM. So you’d have to do with a single 4GB module of DDR4 RAM that it comes with, operating at 2400MHz.</p>
<p>So asking all the right questions, should you buy this 11 inch laptop? Well, if you are a power user, NO as there are plenty more rational options you can avail in this price range (keep reading to learn more) but if you are a sucker for compatibility and convertibility while staying under budget, this is one of the best 11 inch laptop you can get.</p>

<h3>2. Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11E (5th Gen)</h3>
<p><a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2F11e-and-chromebooks%2FThinkPad-Yoga-11e-5th-Gen%2Fp%2F22TP2TX154E20LM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3257 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lenovo-ThinkPad-11e-4th-Gen.jpg" alt="Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11E Convertible Ultrabook" width="550" height="388"></a></p>
<p>If you are one of those not-so-delicate users and need a robust machine that is capable of taking a few bumps and bruises, suitable for the life on the road or a classroom &#8211; Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11e is what’s missing from your life. With scratch-resistant glass, reinforced hinges, the rugged chassis of this midrange convertible-hybrid laptop is capable of what we can call ‘shapeshifting’. For easily bored comrades, Lenovo has come up with a design which you can position in four different modes, Display, Laptop, Tablet, and Tent.</p>
<p>Powered by an Intel Celeron N4100 processor and 4GB of memory, this&nbsp;11 inch ultrabook&nbsp;kind of scores an average rating on operability aspects. On battery run-down tests, the device lasted a middling 7 hours 22 minutes. So not an over the top backup, but not one of the worst either.</p>
<p>So, overall Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11e is on the list because of (a) its miniature design and (b) because of its high resilience to withstand extreme temperatures,&nbsp;humidity, vibration, dust and of course a few shunts. Although it won’t deliver grade A performance, especially when compared to its contending laptops, but it&#8217;s well-spaced chiclet-style keys, gorilla glass, rounded corners, and a rubber bumper certainly add points to its durability and long term reliability.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of convertible laptops and would like to have similar specs and features in a traditional clamshell chassis, then Lenovo also has a <strong>ThinkPad 11E</strong> which is a normal laptop with 11.6-inch display, and just like above mentioned ThinkPad Yoga 11E, it also has reinforced ports and hinges and rubberized bumpers to protect it from shocks. | <strong><a title="Best Price on Lenovo" href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2F11e-and-chromebooks%2FThinkPad-11e-5th-Gen%2Fp%2F22TP2TX154E20LQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check price on Lenovo</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Acer Chromebook CB3-132-C4VV 11 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2E6oQe7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4728 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-132-C4VV.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-132-C4VV 11.6 Inch Laptop" width="550" height="367"></a></p>
<p>A neat, sleek and elegant design offering a range of unique features, the Acer Chromebook CB3-132-C4VV is one of the most affordable and best 11 inch laptop&nbsp;that won’t make you go bankrupt. It is an updated 2016 edition of the popular CB3-132 series from Acer and while it might not acquire a high-scale rating when it comes to power processing but does offer stable performance and a longer battery life.</p>
<p>Running on an Intel Celeron N3060 Dual-Core Processor 2.48GHz, a 4GB RAM and 16GB of flash storage, you can perform basic operation like streaming and browsing without having to worry about performance issues. It does pose a peril of lagging if you try to run more than a few tabs.</p>
<p>Its miniature figure makes it extremely portable and can slip inside your backpack&nbsp;so slickly you won’t even feel it’s there. The device offers a comfy Chiclet-style keyboard with nice clicky keys&nbsp;and it&nbsp;also has a HD web camera which might not produce the sharpest of images but hey, for a price tag that economical, I’ll say the overall package is worth what you are paying for.</p>

<h3>4. HP ProBook X360 11 G3 EE Touchscreen 2 in 1 Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="http://tidd.ly/5d945689" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3704 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HP-X360-ProBook-G1-11-inch-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP ProBook x360 G3 Convertible Touchscreen 11 Inch Laptop with 128GB SSD" width="474" height="277"></a></p>
<p>If you are willing to buy a best convertible 11 inch laptop for a simple routine but are a little tight on coins, you should definitely consider this laptop on the list. Priced only around $500, the x360 offers a very generous selection of ports, and has a quad core Intel Celeron N4100 CPU.</p>
<p>From the performance perspective, the X360 may feel sluggish at times, especially when burdened with hardcore operations. However, its low-power CPU and 128GB of SSD drive helps to extend its battery life up to 10 hours in video-playback.</p>
<p>The HP ProBook x360 G3 is a compact 11 inch laptop, built with a long, sturdy hinge and a large touchpad but somewhat lacks in a screen quality. Although in all its aspects, the architecture is perfect for its target audience. HP with their X360 model wants to aim millennials looking for a single device for work and play, and this machine is capable of doing just that by staying under a very reasonable budget.</p>
<p>Of course, there are going to be a few trade-offs while taking design aspects&nbsp;that inducted in $1,000+ laptops and bringing them down below $500.&nbsp;Particularly the screen gives away the cheap pricing factor with poor viewing angles.</p>

<h3>5. ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02 Rugged 11 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2m0dtbz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2059 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02 11.6- Rugged Laptop" width="550" height="608" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop-271x300.jpg 271w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop-45x50.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>If you are a stay at home mom or a parent who wants to use a sleek and hi-tech machine, all the while needing durability and sturdiness which makes it kid-friendly, then Asus Chromebook C202SA-YS0 is your go-to laptop. Its rugged design, bundled with a spill-resistant keyboard makes it the best 11 inch laptop for classroom usage as well.</p>
<p>Although several reviews have suggested its sluggish performance while running multiple tabs, I think the <a title="Acer Chromebook R11 Review – A Long-Lasting Compact Convertible Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-chromebook-r11-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer Chromebook R11</a> is a much better alternative to this laptop in terms of performance if you&#8217;re ready to shed some more dollars. Powered by a 1.6-GHz Intel Celeron N3060 processor with 4GB of built-in RAM, the C202 can’t be titled as a performance powerhouse. Although, it is fine for drafting a few notes and book reports or even spreadsheet manipulation.</p>
<p>But considering the fact you have landed on this page because of your tight budget, features like a long battery life, a modular and of course a ruggedized design with a price tag this cheap sure doesn’t sound like a bad deal.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want the similar ruggedized laptop with a 2-in-1 form factor, then <strong>ASUS Chromebook Flip C214</strong> is also excellent option.

<p>We are finally able to get our hands on an “affordable” Chromebook with a sylphlike chassis. As for operational capabilities, it is the perfect machine if your usage involves not more than web browsing and indulging in cloud-based content creation. In any other case, you might want to look at other alternatives. The Intel Celeron N3060 processor, might not be the fastest of performers so no sugar coating here. If you are a multi-tasker, you might want to skip this 11 inch laptop.</p>
<p>As for overall aspects, bundled with its appealing looks is an integrated keyboard, along with a solid overall performance and that goes without compromising on battery life. It is not one of the A-grade performers when it comes to processing power or haptic sensitivity but if you are a student who needs to work on research papers and has of course, a limited budget, this is the best 11 inch laptop you can get.</p>

<p>It is not everyday you get to hear about an affordable laptop that offers competent performance. This laptop has enough processing capability to support moderate multi-tasking and has been reviewed to depict minimal or no symptoms of lagging when hampered with a manifold of tabs and processes. Also, if you are a gamer who engages in, for instance casual arcade racing kinda sports, the Dell Inspiron i3162 will be best 11 inch laptop for your use, as long as the game doesn’t require a horsepower of power units.</p>
<p>The battery life however, is rated to be not so satisfactory, and can withstand around 4-5 hours of juice while not plugged in. But for a fair price, an attractive, sleek, 11 inch laptop&nbsp;is not a bad place to invest your money.</p>

<h3>9. HP Stream 11-ak1020nr Laptop &#8211; Best 11 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2oJFJFb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5751 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HP-Stream-11.jpg" alt="HP Stream 11-ak1020nr Laptop" width="550" height="375"></a></p>
<p>This is quite a basic machine, predominantly suitable for students. Why do I say so? Well, there are a couple of reasons, for instance the free Office subscription (limited time only) it comes with along with a ridiculously low price tag, worth only around $200. The SD card slot is the most notable added value as such a reasonable outlay, especially when your usage involves more than a dozen GBs. The performance magnitude is quite good as well, comparatively with other budget laptops in this range, housing a 2.7GHz quad core Intel x5-e8000 processor.</p>
<p>To top it off, the standby battery time it offers and the audio mechanism it is built with, are certainly worth mentioning. Apart from its overall elegant chassis and a slim design, the laptop can be quite an eye-pleaser with the variety of colors it comes with. The only less-than-flattering design aspects are the large bezels and an old-fashioned gradient touch on its base.</p>
<p>To sum it up, nice speakers, highly portable, and above average performance, seems a quite reasonable array of features of this 11 inch notebook considering the price tag that it comes with.</p>

<p>Love Apple products but your tight budget holds you back from yearnings? This is almost the cheapest, and the smallest product in Apple&#8217;s notebook lineup. This ultraportable laptop is largely known due to its tremendous power preservation capabilities, offering a whopping 9+ hours of stand up battery time.</p>
<p>Although, the 11-inch MacBook Air packs a 1.6-GHz Intel Core i5-5250U processor and 4GB of RAM,&nbsp;this upgrade from the 12-inch MacBook is not as impressive as it should be. Mainly because the advancements are quite basic and apart from its exceptional storage and processing capabilities, this machine is a big no no for gaming enthusiasts as the graphics performance is really below the mark and even gaming on Mac doesn&#8217;t seems to be a good idea to me.</p>
<p>May be this is the reason the manufacturers decided to discontinue its production, but nonetheless, with this price tag, it’s a much better alternative than other variants in Apple’s ultrabook lineup and if you find this 11 inch laptop&nbsp;worth your money, you can certainly find its <a title="Refurbished Laptops at Apple" href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/FJVP2LL/A/refurbished-116-inch-macbook-air-16ghz-dual-core-intel-core-i5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">refurbished or used models</a>.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are inevitably difficult to be made. Reason? They have to stay inexpensive yet provide good performance and the most difficult part, it has to compete with the market that’s now full of Chromebooks available for dirt cheap prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3310" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11" width="469" height="332" /></p>
<p>The R11 is launched with a base price of under $300 and therefore, it has to deliver a lot for the asking price. As far as the design and built factor are concerned, the R11 comes with an 11.6-inch screen size which is decked out in a very clean and tidy chassis. The laptop comes with a diamond patterned finish from the outside which gives an additional level of grip, making it easy to hold and carry. Although the company (Acer) claims that the outer lid of the laptop is made up of aluminum, we felt that it was feeble and the design wasn’t very solidly built.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 - Lid" width="372" height="260" /></p>
<p>Having that said, the laptop offers great ergonomics, which you hardly get at this price point. The device comes with compact measurements at 11.6 x 8.03 x 0.76 inches which fit well in bags. Moreover, it weighs just about 2.7 pounds, which is yet another add-on.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a 360-degrees hinge, which is the core of its convertible aspect. The laptop flips well and can be used in four different modes.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen HD WideScreen LED-backlit display with a resolution of 1366&#215;768 pixels. The screen comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which now is a standard and common thing we see in most of the laptops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible - Display" width="700" height="507" /></p>
<p>The laptop offers good color gamut and also manages to provide decent viewing angles. However, what made us disappointed is that the laptop’s display is not adequately bright which makes the outdoor usage a bit cumbersome. Even at the brightness set to maximum, the display didn’t felt very bright, which affects the crispness and contrasts of the regular usage. During our benchmarking, the laptop managed to score a mere 225 nits of brightness, which is subpar considering its contenders which manage to score over 300 nits.</p>
<p>When we put the laptop display’s color reproduction to test, we got a decent 74% of sRGB spectrum, which is very well on top of other Chromebooks priced similarly. We also used the device to watch some high-quality movies and other content, to which the display responded well and gave us a decent experience minus the brightness.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C1LK) is stuffed with decent specifications for the asking price. The device is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor paired with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM. The processor, however, can be throttled up to 2.08GHz through the Intel’s Burst technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The display as mentioned above is an 11.6-inch HD display, which comes with a 10-point multi-touch support. Storage segment on the device is backed by a 32GB of solid-state drive internal storage which is very less and that&#8217;s the problem with every Chromebook these days. Thankfully, like most others, the Acer Chromebook R11 also comes with an SD card slot to add more storage.<br />

<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with one USB 3.0 port for faster, better, and reliable data transfers and comes with another USB 2.0 port to add on an additional peripheral. The R11 also houses one HDMI Port, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a charging port.</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-image-3315 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible Laptop" width="650" height="398" /><p id="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Chromebook R 11 offers USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card Slot and 3.5mm Audio Jack</strong></em></p></div>
<p>For the connectivity, the Acer Chromebook R11 is packed with the latest MIMO 802.11ac wireless technology to support smooth, reliable, and interruption free internet browsing experience. It comes with Dual-Band support to house both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with ease.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with a 720p HD front-facing webcam. The camera like most of the other laptops doesn’t offer any fancy stuff here. The camera takes images with noise and doesn’t produce accurate colors. However, it will suffice your occasional Skype or Hangout calls. The images captured looks a bit muffled. However, the image adjusts quickly on the frame.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The R11 doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned, on what OS does the device runs on. It runs on the latest Chrome OS, which is powered by Google. Google also promised, regular updates, to keep the device safe and lag-free. Although there isn’t much to say about the OS, we want our viewers to know that almost all the tasks in the Chromebooks are confined in a web UI, i.e in the browser.</p>
<p>It might be exciting to know that, Google also promised that the Chromebooks, will soon be able to run Android applications. However, as of now, the R11 doesn’t run android applications. We expect Google to roll the compatibility in an iterative process in the near future.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are not as powerful as the other Windows OS based counterparts. However, the devices manage to impress with their sturdy performance. Although the devices come with a moderately powerful set of hardware, it’s the light-weight software of the Chrome OS, which makes the things smooth and easy.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the Acer Chromebook R11 comes with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor and a 4GB of RAM. This set of hardware is powerful enough to house most of our daily essentials. To test this, we used the device extensively and here is what we’ve felt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 - Performance" width="480" height="298" /></p>
<p>The R11 handled almost all the basic tasks with ease. Browsing the internet, watching videos, multimedia usage, and editing documents were smooth and lag free. The device takes considerably negligible boot up time and loads very quickly. The device tends to get slightly heated when throttled to its full potential. However, the heat remains in limit and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to use. Being a Chromebook, users need to keep their expectations in check. That said, a Chromebook is far from <a title="Top 8 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a>, and other heavy graphic-demanding applications.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the R11 is neat and sturdy and feels solid to type on. The trackpad is rightly placed and comes with adequate space for the palm rest while using.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Chromebook we expect the device to handle Chrome browser with ease. Since almost all the tasks in the device are performed in a web interface, we rapidly switched between a dozen tabs in Chrome, to which the device responded really well. We also managed to run a couple of benchmarks to get a lucid view of the performance of the device, and here is what we’ve managed to achieve with the R11. It scored an 8,200 in Octane and close to 5000 on Mozilla Kraken. These benchmarks correspond to the ability to run scripts in the browser and overall performance.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 although can be a decent multimedia companion, but the device isn’t any groundbreaking in the segment. Discredits to its dull display and muffled speaker output, you will have to keep your expectations in check.</p>
<p>The device can play almost all formats of video content with ease and we didn’t face any lag or frame drops. The speakers are considerably loud but however, the sound tends to get crackled at higher volumes.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>During our time with the device, the Chromebook R11 lasted slightly over 10 hours on a single charge. The device is backed by a 3220mAh battery and the battery backup of the Chromebook is what makes it a very worthy contender in the segment. The device gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in about 2 hours, and stays juiced up to handle all your essentials.</p>
<p>All that said, Battery backup is undeniably a very strong aspect of the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Touchscreen Laptop" width="450" height="344" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg 450w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-300x229.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Acer Chromebook R11 with impeccable battery life and convertible option makes it a very good buy for the asking price. The touchscreen option, and very neatly recessed keyboard and trackpad make it an easy to use it. However, like with every laptop, it certainly has its own hits and misses. The laptop’s display is dull and the audio output is pretty mediocre.</p>
<p>However, if one is ready to trade off those two aspects with the long-lasting battery backup and stable performance, the Acer Chromebook R11 is certainly a value for money investment. It is also worth considering that most of the other contenders in the price range fall behind the R11 when it comes to performance and versatility that it offers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Chromebooks are probably the most renowned and well-known series of chromebooks across the globe. That said, since the inception of Chrome OS, very few brands started endorsing it and made this OS available in their machines. Acer is one among those aforementioned rare brands, who took the step further and brought a powerful lineup of Chromebooks to the audience. Moreover, the brand has also made sure that they will be available for all the price segments and have thus launched various models starting at as low as $160.</p>
<p>Although all the models, didn&#8217;t quite excelled in their segments, there are few Chromebooks, which established a firm market share and are currently one of the best sellers globally. Today, we are going to make you familiar with one of the most compact, efficient, and a complete value for money Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook 11 (CB3-131-C3SZ). We had quite a long and good time spending with this laptop, and here is our full review of it:<span id="more-1766"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Although the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ is the cheapest chromebook available in the market, it does a pretty good job in offering a clean and polished exteriors. The laptop comes with a white case, which although looks neat and clean feels cheap. During our usage, we also felt that the laptop was hollow in certain areas from the chassis. One thing which is admirable in the laptop is its ruggedness. The chassis of the laptop doesn&#8217;t attract any smudges or scratches on it. On an overall note, the Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ is quite good for the asking price. Do note that you&#8217;re getting this laptop at the price of a toy. Uh, a costly toy maybe.</p>

Key alignment and the keypad’s placement is largely similar to that of all other chromebooks. The keys are clear, visible, and are unfortunately not backlit enabled. The keyboard comes with good mechanics and all the keys offer good tactile feedback. Using TypingTest.com, I managed to score around 92 words per minute with six errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my MacBook Air. All that said, the laptop does offer a great keyboard for the asking price.</p>

<p>As far as the touchpad on this laptop is concerned, it is nice and spacious and works well with multitouch gestures as well. The laptop offers gestures including—touch to click, double touch to right-click, swipe with three fingers to switch between apps and much more based on the customisation. But we didn&#8217;t have a pleasant time using the mechanical click buttons on the trackpad. During our usage, these mechanical clicks often got stuck, which was annoying.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Coming to the display segment of the laptop, the Acer Chromebook CB3 sports an 11.6-inch HD display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The display is of IPS LED type and comes with the Acer’s proprietary ComfyView Widescreen technology for a better viewing experience. Also, the screen is set to a fixed aspect ratio of 16:9. The matte display on the CB3 gains it an advantage when it comes to providing adequate brightness without hurting eyes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1830" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ Laptop - Display" width="750" height="474" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-300x190.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-610x386.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-600x379.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Not to mention, the laptop is priced under $200. The screen is combined with a laid back wide angles along with the decent amount of brightness and contrast. Matte finish on the display makes it suitable for almost all the indoor usage conditions.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Before we start giving out the specifications and hardware stuff of this Chromebook, we would like the viewers to first recollect the price of this device and proceed down. Under the hood, the laptop packs in a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2840 processor. The laptop is dual-core and with the help of Intel Burst technology, the laptop can achieve a clock speed of 2.58GHz. For multitasking, the Acer Chromebook 11 is equipped with a 2GB of DDR3L RAM, which is although very less when compared to other Windows-based laptops, is quite adequate for Chrome OS.</p>
<p>For graphics, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ ships with an integrated intel graphics processor, which takes care of rendering minor graphics. For storage, it offers a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-expandable</span> 16GB of solid state drive internal storage, which we feel is the major letdown for this budget-friendly Chromebook. However, if you&#8217;re always connected to the internet, then Google is offering free 100GB of online cloud storage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 offers an HD web camera at top of the screen. The camera is pretty fast in adjusting images on the frame. The shot to shot time is also comparatively very less than those in its competitors. The laptop is ideal for Skype or any other video calls due to its compact-sized weight.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1832" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Porst and Slots" width="1100" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 1100w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-300x112.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-768x288.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-610x228.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-600x225.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" />This pint-sized value-for-money laptop comes with a USB 3.0 port for faster file transfers. There is another USB 2.0 port, which comes quite handy if one requires connecting an additional peripheral. The laptop also comes with an HDMI port with HDCP port for wired media sharing.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ runs on the Google’s proprietary Chrome OS, which is a lightweight operating system for laptops. The OS is well-known for its resource utilisation and can deliver decent performance even under a feeble set of specifications. Accordingly, the CB3 offers a very decent performance for the hardware it packs in.</p>
<p>Although the software on the laptop offers a couple of interesting features such as file viewer, app grid, document editor, and more, there are few segments wherein, the software struggles. During our usage, we clearly felt that the software is not very well polished. However, we hope that it gets fixed with some regular updates. The Acer Chromebook CB3 is one among the <a title="Chrome OS Systems Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very few laptops listed</a> to eventually get access to the Google Play Store. In addition to that, it comes with all the popular Google’s lineup of apps with built-in: Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Hangouts.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>What performance would you expect from a laptop costing $160? That said, we aren&#8217;t demoting this laptop in any manner. It&#8217;s just that the hardware packed in the CB3 is very basic and evidently one cannot expect a class-leading performance from it. A dual-core entry-level mobile processor paired with a 2GB of RAM is although capable of handling basic tasks, it struggles under heavy usage. The best part is, the laptop is fan-less and therefore, doesn&#8217;t produce any sound during usage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Exterior" width="740" height="655" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg 740w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-300x266.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-610x540.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-600x531.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-50x44.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" />All the daily essentials such as browsing internet, handling text editors and readers runs fine without any considerable lag in them. In fact, we were quite amused from the performance and apps handling in the CB3. The laptop is pretty fast and quick when compared to the Windows counterpart. The Chrome OS is a great add-on for this entry-level laptop as there are not many background applications and services in Chrome OS as compared to a Windows OS.</p>

<p>On the connectivity front, the laptop supports a dual band 802.11ac WiFi featuring the company’s proprietary MIMO technology for faster network reception.</p>
<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, the laptop does quite good in handling graphics. Especially, considering the basic integrated graphics on the device. We ran few games such as tank rider and speed racer games, which although are light on graphics are quite entertaining. To our surprise, the laptop handled them all without any kind of lags or hiccups.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with two built-in stereo speakers which support high definition audio. We tried playing high definition FLAC files, for which the laptop did pretty well. The sound output is although not very loud, the audio produced is easily sufficient to fill a small sized room. We also tried playing some Full HD and 2K video content on the chromebook 11, for which the laptop did really well. Sadly, the laptop struggled a lot to handle 4K content.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ stays pumped up using a 36 watt-hour battery, which is quite average considering the specifications. However, Acer did really well to squeeze a little more from the battery. Even during our usage, the laptop managed to deliver about 8 hours of continuous usage, which included watching videos running few basic benchmarks and browsing. During all the time, the WiFi was enabled. Therefore, we expect the laptop to deliver a little more of battery backup when the network reception is disabled. The laptop can be fully charged in less than 2 hours which is great.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11" width="750" height="560" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-300x224.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-610x455.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-600x448.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />On an overall note, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6-Inch Laptop is a complete value for money offering from Acer. The laptop not only managed to impress us, but also amazed us with some aspects such as battery life and performance. Assuming, you&#8217;re looking for a compact, value for money, and a browsing focussed laptop, then the Chromebook 11 must definitely be in your wish list.</p>
<p>At the asking price, there are hardly any competitors for the laptop. Not to mention the Chrome OS is a perfect supplement for the hardware the laptop packs in.</p>
