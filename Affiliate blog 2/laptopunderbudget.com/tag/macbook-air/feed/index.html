										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2018 Retina MacBook Air was <a title="New 2018 Apple MacBook Air With Retina Display Announced" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/new-2018-apple-macbook-air-announced/">announced a while back</a> and here we have some numbers that show how well it performs as compared to the previous model. Geekbench tests show that the Retina MacBook Air with Core i5 processor was able to score about 4200 points in the single-core test and around 7800 points in the multi-core tests.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous model, the new 2018 Retina MacBook Air performs 27% better in the single-core test and 28% better in the multi-core test. While this is a synthetic benchmark, it does show us that the new MacBook Air is a significant upgrade over the previous generation model.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Air also performs better than the 12-inch MacBook. The MacBook Air performs 20% better in single-core tests and 17% better in multi-core tests. Moving on to the mid-2017 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, which scored 4314 points in the single-core test and is 16% faster when comparing multi-core performance. You need to note that this model is $100 more expensive than the new MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro is able to score 16464 in the multi-core test and 4504 points in the single-core test. While the single-core performance is pretty close to the 2018 Retina MacBook Air, the Pro model has more cores and is able to beat the Air in the multi-core test.</p>
<p>This is a synthetic benchmark so you need to take this with a grain of salt. This might not translate too well into real-world performance. But it does provide an insight into what you can expect. This is also a leak and you should wait until the MacBook Air is released so that third-parties can do their own tests.</p>
<p>If these numbers are indeed true then that means that the 2018 Retina MacBook Air is a pretty solid laptop. Especially when compared to the older model. If you have the older model then the new version is a significant upgrade. While the 2018 Retina MacBook Air does seem a bit expensive starting at $1100, it is still the least expensive model that comes with a retina display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2018 Apple MacBook Air has just been announced with the Retina Display. It&#8217;s not as cheap as we expected to be, though! Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the New MacBook Air that Apple just announced.</p>
<p>The 2018 Apple MacBook Air comes with plenty of new features. The design has changed and if you are among the few people like me who prefers the physical &#8216;Escape&#8217; button over the one on Touch bar, then you will be glad to know that the 2018 Apple MacBook Air does not come with Touch bar!</p>
<h2>Everything That&#8217;s New in 2018 Apple MacBook Air</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4509 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/macbook-air-2018-annoucement.jpg" alt="2018 Apple MacBook Air" width="1595" height="895" />The new MacBook Air is not a refresh, it is not a revamp, it is a new design. Plenty of things are different and here we are going to look into what this much awaited New MacBook Air has to offer.</p>
<h3>Touch ID without Touch bar</h3>
<p>The new MacBook Air comes with Touch ID. Even though this feature has been removed from the latest phones that Apple makes, you will get this feature on this new MacBook. You will be able to unlock your device and make transactions using your fingerprint. Touch ID also activates Hey, Siri which is another great feature.</p>
<h3>All New Design</h3>
<p>The MacBook Air is supposed to be thin and light. The new model is 10% slimmer than the previous one and weighs only 2.75 pounds. This might not be the lightest laptop in the world but it is pretty close. The overall footprint of the device is 17% smaller than the previous model.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4510 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/macbook-air-stage.jpg" alt="2018 Apple MacBook Air" width="1540" height="892" /></p>
<p>The new MacBook Air comes with a bigger trackpad. Compared to the previous model the trackpad is 20% larger. This means more surface area and better productivity. If the tight space provided to you on the older device was an issue, it&#8217;s not going to be a problem now.</p>
<p>The new 2018 MacBook Air also comes with a new keyboard. Apple has upgraded the device with the 3rd generation butterfly switch. This ensures a more ergonomic and silent typing experience.</p>
<h3>Apple MacBook Air Specifications</h3>
<p>A new design is great, Apple has never failed to provide that. What do you get inside? Inside the 2018 MacBook Air, you have the latest Intel 8th Generation dual-core CPUs. You can configure your device with up to 16 GB of RAM, which was not possible in previous models. You can also configure an SSD of up to 1.5 TB.</p>
<p>Moving on to battery life, while we do not have the exact battery capacity for the device, we do know that the device is capable of lasting 12 hours when browsing the web. It can last an additional hour if you are watching a video. This is the claimed battery life but the real world numbers will be a bit different.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the MacBook Air offers two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3. This means that you can connect an external graphics card to the device. One of these ports will be used for charging, so you are not going to connect many devices to it at the same time unless you get third-party solutions.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The base model MacBook Air 2018 comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. The price for this configuration is $1,199. While this might seem like an expensive device keeping in mind that this is a MacBook Air, it is the cheapest MacBook with a Retina display.</p>
<h2>The New Mac mini</h2>
<p>Apple has also announced new iPads with Face ID and also refreshed the Mac mini, which is basically a computer without the integrated display and Apple peripherals. The new mini has a similar design but with more ports and it can be configured with up to a 6-core Intel 8th generation CPU, 2TB flash storage and 64GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The base model comes with 8GB of memory, a 3.6 GHz quad-core processor and a 128GB SSD and it starts at $799.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4511 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mac-mini-stage.jpg" alt="2018 Mac Mini" width="1600" height="1056" />The new 2018 Apple MacBook Air seems like a great product and even though it is more expensive when compared to the previous models, it offers plenty of exciting new features including Touch ID, Retina display and most importantly better performance.</p>
<p>The new hardware and the changes in design plus the fact that it comes with a Retina display should be motivation enough for you to upgrade your device. Provided that you are fine with paying the Apple tax.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">Apple event that&#8217;s going to happen on 30 October.</a> Much speculation has been circulating on the web regarding what Apple might unveil next. Several rumors have hinted a few Mac products coming our way including MacBook, iMac, iPad Pro, and an Apple Watch too.</p>
<h2>Apple has registered to sell new devices</h2>
<p>Just when we thought we had the fall event figured out, a new report has resurfaced. According to<a href="https://consomac.fr/news-9503-apple-depose-ses-nouveaux-macs-doctobre-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> a filing at the Eurasian Economic Commission&#8217;s product registry</a>, Apple has requested permission to sell new computers. If you are unaware of the term EEC, it is an organization that regulates and approves the marketing of electronic products on the Eurasian Economic Union grounds.</p>
<p>The filing has been translated from French from the website and includes a few macOS 10.14 running Macs. A series of macOS 10.14 MacBooks were also listed, among which the A1932 model has been found in prior listings too. We are sure that its a laptop model code. However, the only new entries in the list are A1993, A2115, and A2116. This means we can expect at least three new Apple products to be unveiled on October 30.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to another report, a K-12 education order for some Mac products placed recently by a customer was delayed. The order included a MacBook Air, iPad and Apple Pencil out of which only the iPad and Apple Pencil were received. The shipment of MacBook Air was delayed by Apple to 30 October, which sounds far from a coincidence.</p>
<p>Reminiscing to the predictions made by the supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the upcoming MacBook could be a replacement for the existing MacBook Air. The said device is to feature a 13-inch Retina display, replacing the nebulous and outdated display of the MacBook Air. It is also predicted to be embedded with Intel&#8217;s latest 9th generation chipset. To top it off, the entire package will be wrapped with a $1200 worth of bow. On another bright note, we&#8217;d be getting the older MacBook model for just $999.</p>
<p>But, there is still so much that we can presume at the moment. In just 5 more days we&#8217;d have all the answers about the MacBook upgrades that we have been giddily waiting for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been the talk of the town that Apple might be planning to fully seize the holiday opportunity and finally unveil their long-awaited iPad Pro, MacBook and MacBook Air devices. According to recent updates, the Apple event is not afar and October could be the month holding the Fall 2018 event.</p>
<p>If we recall the &#8216;Gather Round&#8217; event Apple held in September, it was solely for Apple&#8217;s new iPhone series and Apple watches. Now new iPad and MacBook releases aren&#8217;t usually coupled with iPhone releases. Apple missing out on them in their last event might just mean that they are planning to make a comeback. Much like they did back in 2016 to bring the refreshed MacBook Pros in the market after a few weeks of their iPhone 7 release.</p>
<h2>Do we see a MacBook Air upgrade?</h2>
<p>For over a year we have been caught in the hopes of a 13-inch low priced MacBook Air. We don&#8217;t know if the device will be called &#8216;Air&#8217; for that matter. Apple could place them in the 12-inch MacBook family or the MacBook Air series. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-20/apple-is-said-to-plan-revamped-low-cost-macs-to-reignite-sales">Bloomberg</a>, the design of the new MacBook might be inspired by the Air family.</p>
<p>It is expected that the new MacBook will be handy for schools, students and bargain hunters given its easy on the pocket price tag. That also means that Apple is reaching out to its consumers who were put off by the $1300 price tag on their 12-inch MacBooks. But that was back in 2015.</p>
<p>The current MacBook Air does lack a good screen so, as an upgrade, the new laptop will be featuring a &#8216;Retina display&#8217; as well as slimmer bezels from the MacBook Pro. Another expected improvement in the MacBooks might be its processors as the last boost Apple gave to it was in 2017  but even then, it was not a mentionable upgrade. I think that the Whiskey Lake chip released by Intel a few months ago might just have opened an opportunity for Apple to bump up their outdated MacBook Airs which are still running on 5th gen processors.</p>
<p>Considering Apple is going to market the new MacBook &#8216;Air&#8217; towards light pocketed users, the device should cost from $800 to $1200. But we have reason to believe that it&#8217;s going to be for $1000.</p>
<h3>Is a 12-inch MacBook in the picture?</h3>
<p>Apart from the MacBook Air rumors, there have also been news that Apple might also be planning to expand their much popular MacBook family.  Similar to MacBook Air, we are expecting a processor boost in MacBooks as well. We believe that the Intel&#8217;s Amber Lake Y series processor (also announced in August) might be the best fit for this machine since improved battery performance and processing power is just what MacBooks need at the moment.</p>
<p>At this point, it&#8217;s all speculation since Apple has been too clammed up regarding their Fall event, let alone the expected releases of their MacBooks. But if Apple focuses on their MacBook Air series with the upgrade that they rightfully deserve, they might just knock-off the 12-inch MacBooks off the big shelves at that too with a cheaper tag.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: October 18 &#8211;</strong> <em>Apple will hold its Fall Event Focusing iPad and MacBook on 30th October (<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">Read full story</a>)</em></p>
