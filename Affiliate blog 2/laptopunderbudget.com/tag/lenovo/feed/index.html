										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lenovo has been at it at the MWC 19, back to back unleashing a storm of creative laptops catering to all kinds of consumers. This time, we are talking about the Ideapads and the new 14 inch Enterprise laptops.</p>
<p>With the Ideapads, Lenovo has successfully brought together the affordability of mainstream machines coupled with the perks of premiums. The Ideapad lineup includes C340, S340 and S540. Whereas, the new enterprise laptop series include the 14e Chromebook Enterprise and the 14w Enterprise.</p>
<h3>Lenovo 14e Chromebook and 14w Enterprise</h3>
<p>Both versions of the enterprise laptops are are intended to “increase firstline worker productivity” in the retail, manufacturing and educational industries according to Lenovo.</p>
<p>Lenovo’s 14w Enterprise is an alternative of the 14e Chromebook offering  Windows instead of Chrome OS. Both laptops feature an aluminum chassis that is sturdy enough for classroom and outdoor use. Lenovo has found the balance between high-end features and reasonable cost with this duo and has come around to deliver enterprise consumers a reliable laptop able to get their workers or students connected to various business services.</p>
<p>The 14w Enterprise might not be the lightest laptop Lenovo has unveiled this year, but it is still quite portable weighing <span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">up to only 3.39lbs. The port selection is quite student friendly and includes a USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI 1.4, a microSD card slot, and one combo audio jack.</span></p>
<p>Both laptops are assembled with narrow bezel displays and equipped with touchscreen support. Lenovo 14w Enterprise houses an AMD 3GHz A6 dual-core processor, AMD graphics, RAM up to 8GB and storage options up to either 128GB eMMc or 256GB SSD. Lenovo has also equipped it with Dolby Audio and a power backup of up to an 11-hours. The Chromebook variant is equipped with AMD’s dual-core A4-9120C all-in-one chip (APU), same RAM an the sibling but storage going up to just 64 GBs. Now what makes this Chromebook enterprise friendly as the specs are completely customizable according to each user&#8217;s specific needs. There is also the spill proof technology that makes it resistant to rough classroom usage.</p>
<p>To power the 14e Chromebook, Lenovo’s has loaded this laptop with a 57Wh battery delivering up to 10 hours of backup. The ports selection on the 14e includes two USB-C ports, two USB-A, a MicroSD card slot, and a 3.5mm audio combo port. An interesting addition in this affordable notebook is the 180-degree hinge that lets you lay flat the Chromebook on a table for shared presentations.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Enterprise consumers will be able to get their hands on the 14w Enterprise in March for a starting price of just $299 USD. While the Lenovo 14e Chromebook arrives in April starting at $279.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the midst of MWC 2019, Lenovo is taking huge leaps for upgrading their ThinkPad lineup. The laptop giant Lenovo, announced their latest additions &#8211; the X390, and X390 Yoga to the ThinkPad portfolio.</p>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390</h3>
<p>Lenovo has bumped up the display from 12 to a 13-inch, but the best part is that the overall form factor of the device has not been compromised. As expected in 2019, Lenovo has introduced 50% slimmer bezels which has resulted in an even slimmer machine than before, rounding to 0.6 inches thin and weighing just 2.7 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5322" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Launched-at-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Launched at MWC 2019" width="700" height="517" /></p>
<p>Inside, there is an 8th Gen Intel Core vPro i7 processor, up to 32GB of RAM, and storage goes up to 1TB. The ports selection on the ThinkPad X390 includes a Thunderbolt 3, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1, an HDMI input slot, a microSD card slot, alongside a Kensington lock, and a single jack for mic and headset connectivity. Lenovo has also promised for the laptop to deliver up to 17 hours of power backup and also introduced some nifty security features. Like the PrivacyGuard that utilizes the built-in IR camera to detect snoopers behind you- enabling alerts and using the ThinkShutter to tone down the brightness for prying eyes only.</p>
<p>The screen options on the ThinkPad X390 include a basic 13.3-inch, 1080p touch display with 300 nits of brightness and a 13.3-inch, 1080p PrivacyGuard non-touch alternative with 400 nits brightness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Top Picks of Laptops For Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga</h3>
<p>Now, Lenovo&#8217;s Yoga series has been a portable marvel for all travelers and on-the-run kind of consumers. Its refreshing to see that alongside the X390, the X390 Yoga is also getting a boost. Toning down an already slim screen, the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 will be 2 percent thinner to 9.6 inches and 5 percent lighter to just 2.9 lbs from its previous version.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5323" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Yoga-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga - MWC 2019" width="815" height="500" /></p>
<p>The only display option on the Yoga X390 is a 13.3 inch display, 1080p IPS touch screen and 300 nits of brightness. Such neat specs really doesn&#8217;t let you miss the lack of variety in it.</p>
<p>With the same processing capacity and storage as its sibling, the Yoga X390 can only be bumped up to 16 GB of RAM. The battery life is also toned down and can go up to just 14.5 hours. With an integrated HD Graphics 620 GPU, the ports gallery on this one remains the same as the ThinkPad X390. What&#8217;s unique in this one is the <strong>LTE connectivity</strong> (with the Wi-Fi 6 protocol that has been configured into both models) and a stylus pen that seems like an essential for all portables. But the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 does lack the PrivacyGuard feature without losing the HD camera and the ThinkShutter cover.</p>
<p>However, both sibling share the dual far-field noise-canceling microphones, delivering top-notch voice output during conferencing and while using smart assistants.</p>
<p>Both laptops are expected to hit the shelves in May. The ThinkPad X390 is starting from $1,099, and the Yoga variant from $1,359.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have seen massive diversity in almost all gadgets and devices unveiled at CES 2019. But the trend that most widely dominated all, was slim bezels. Now, Lenovo jumped into the &#8216;bezel-less&#8217; bandwagon back in 2016 with their Yoga 910 but failed to live up to that title due to the large chin of the laptop which spoiled the entire look. That is not the case this time with Lenovo&#8217;s latest creation the Yoga S940.</p>
<div id="attachment_5180" style="width: 539px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5180" class="size-full wp-image-5180" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-CES-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 Announced at CES 2019" width="529" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5180" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>This time in CES 2019, just having a weightless form factor and a wide screen wouldn&#8217;t do a new ultrabook any favors. As every second laptop displayed at the event contains just that. Gladly, Lenovo found a way around that dilemma and equipped this laptop with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The aspect that Yoga S940 focuses most on is user privacy. The Glance by Mirametrix attention-sensing AI is able to detect user presence and turning the screen on or off based on their engagement. It also keeps away nosy nellies by detecting an unwanted set of eyes on the screen of peepers. There is also a built-in eye tracking system that senses your focus and eye movement, switching the content based on its judgment.</p>
<p>Another beautiful feature is screen quality of the Yoga S940. It boasts a 13.9-inch panel with either 4K HDR400 support and 500-nit brightness or a 1080p display that comes with Dolby Vision and 400-nit brightness. The almost edge to edge screen &#8211; thanks to some seriously thin bezels, is accompanied with a curved glass that melts into the lid.</p>
<div id="attachment_5182" style="width: 819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5182" class="size-full wp-image-5182" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-contour-glass.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 contour glass" width="809" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5182" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>There are also touch-less sign-in methods enabled by the infrared (IR) camera that uses Windows Hello via facial recognition and iris scanning. And if you prefer voice login, there is also the Smart Voice technology with both Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga S940 is using 8th Gen Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. Connectivity options include two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port. So there goes the regular USB-A port which was quite expected due to the change of culture towards USB-C.</p>
<p>Lenovo will start rolling out the Yoga S940 from May 2019 pricing from $1,500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to be outdone, Lenovo unveiled a lot at CES 2019, including a refresh of their Legion gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Taking center stage to unveil their new Legion Y740 (17-inch and 15-inch) and Y540 (15-inch) models, which are both refreshes of the Y730 and Y530 gaming laptops that they released last year, Lenovo&#8217;s latest line of gaming laptops will both be equipped with the latest Intel 8th Gen Processors and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.</p>
<h2 class="speakableTextP1">What&#8217;s New with the Legion Gaming Laptops?</h2>
<p>For the Legion Y740, users can opt for various configurations per unit. This includes the option to have up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM installed, as well as either a 15-inch or a 17-inch display with optional 144Hz refresh rate and NVIDIA G-SYNC support. Both device sizes will also come equipped with beautiful RGB backlit keys powered by the iCUE software by Corsair; support for Dolby Vision HDR software for ultra-vivid picture quality; a significantly brighter screen at up to 500 nits; and finally, a Dolby Atmos Speaker System with Dolby Sound Radar for improved audio quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while both devices can come with either the Intel Core i5-8300H or Intel Core i7-8750H, only the 17-inch model can come equipped with the latest the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU, while the 15-inch model will have to &#8220;settle&#8221; with the NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU.</p>

<p>As for the Legion Y540, the more affordable 15-inch gaming laptop won&#8217;t lag too far behind its bigger siblings in terms of specs. It will come equipped with a yet unannounced Intel Core processor and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU. Also, at only 5.1 pounds, what the Y540 lacks in power, it makes up for with portability. Lenovo also equipped the Y540 with Harman Kardon speakers and support for Dolby Atmos for an immersive gaming experience, as well as a white backlit keyboard with a response time of under 1ms.</p>
<p>Other important notable features available across all models include support for various storage options (512GB PCIe SSD, 512GB SATA SSD, and a 2TB SATA HDD), a better cooling system, longer battery life, and an improved aluminum display hinge for added monitor stability.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Lenovo plans to make their latest line of Legion gaming laptops available later this year.</p>
<p>Lenovo will begin shipping out the 15-inch and 17-inch Legion Y740 laptops first in February. The 15-inch model will start at $1,749.99 and the 17-inch model will start at $1,979.99.</p>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, Lenovo will start shipping the lower-specced laptops out in May starting at $929.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If we recall, Lenovo has been playing with the idea of bendable devices for the past few years now. In 2016, Lenovo released a prototype of a bendable mobile that could wrap around your wrist. The device however, never evolved past a concept and Lenovo never released a proper functional bendable mobile. Sometime later in 2017, Lenovo unveiled a concept of a bendable Folio tablet that can be transformed into a smartphone and can be switched into different modes just by a few movements of the hand.</p>
<p>Since then we have seen double display panels in a foldable architecture but never a single screened bendable display. The reason is that it&#8217;s not quite simple. For a device to be bendable, it should have a flexible battery and a motherboard too.</p>
<p>With rumors floating about Samsung working on a bendable display, Lenovo decided to jump at it again. Turns out that Lenovo and LG might be collaborating to introduce a foldable 13-inch tablet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We know that LG Display has developed a 13-inch foldable panel and signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Lenovo,&#8221;</p>
<p>An industry official said. &#8220;The official development project has started and we plan to supply it in the second half of next year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The concept will kind of work around the idea of a &#8216;convertible&#8217; device. The 13-inch can be bent into different form factors. It is unclear at this point if this device is going to be Windows based or Android based. It obviously makes sense for LG to work on the display and Lenovo on the device hardware.</p>
<p>Although Lenovo has a strong track record with Windows based devices, the 7.8-inch Folio was an Android tablet. It had a hinge in its middle that allows the entire thing to fold into a 5.5-inch, dual screen smartphone style device.</p>
<p>The panel is <span class="a_ict_word">organic light emitting diodes</span> (OLEDs) based and features a flexible screen. the 13 inch screen size is certainly bigger than the other foldable panels prepared by competitors. The foldable prototype that Samsung is working on is reportedly of 7.3 inches. Moreover, Huawei is working with BOE in China to develop an 8-inch foldable device.</p>
<p>Considering that the 13-inch panel large enough to be used as a laptop, so even when folded it won&#8217;t be handy to be used as a smartphone. A 13-inch panel with a 4:3 aspect ratio would be about 9 inches when folded. So at a 16-to-9 aspect ratio, it will become 8 inches wide in a converted state. Due to these facts, we have reason to believe that the LG Display 13-inch Foldable Panel is an attempt to develop a tablet like device that can be folded, not a phone. To be fair, it makes sense for tablets to fall into the flexible category instead of phones. No one would practically want to shrink an already palm-sized device.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Considering the durability and usability aspects of the display industry, a tablet or notebook can be more suitable for a foldable panel,&#8221; said LG Display. He added, &#8220;This observation is supported by the fact that PC makers, not smartphones, are trying to supply panels. Lenovo is the world&#8217;s largest PC manufacturer. LG Display is promoting a 13-inch foldable panel to Lenovo as well as Dell and LG Electronics. This is a strategy to pioneer and expand the foldable device and panel market by allowing these PC makers to develop finished products. A representative of LG Display said, &#8220;I can not confirm the contents related to the development of the foldable panel and the customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
