										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, you must have learned about <a title="HP gives a boost to their Elite 800 notebooks with SureSense and advanced privacy features" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/hp-gives-boost-elite-800-notebooks-suresense-advanced-privacy-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP&#8217;s Elitebook upgrades</a> but that&#8217;s not all HP is up to. Their already top of the line business machines the ZBooks are now powered with even improved hardware and endowed with high build quality.</p>
<p>The new upgrades involve the 14U and 15U G6 workstations, named for their 14 and 15.6-inch screen sizes. But that is the only major difference between them. The insides are assembled with eighth-generation Intel CPU with tons of variants to choose from. Starting at the Core i5-8265U, and going all the way up to the i7-8665U. Storage options go from 128GB to 2TB of SSD while you can configure the machines with 32GB of DDR4 memory, an AMD WX 3200 graphics if you are in pursuit of 3D rendering.</p>
<p>Now all this might not be packed in the exterior that you imagine but trust me, do not let the skinny frame fool you. Their contemporary aluminium chassis can withstand much more than traditional &#8216;durable&#8217; machines. HP has managed to make these brawny enough to pass 19 MIL-STD tests so the professional users do not have to worry about travelling with them in unpleasant weather conditions. However, their gauntness did take a toll on the port selection. You will only find a USB 3.0 port, an RJ-45 Ethernet input, a Thunderbolt port, an HDMI and headphone jack in the selection. HP also sacrificed the U-Series Intel chips for H-series which might not be able to live up to the typical workstation laptop performance. But let&#8217;s hope that the Core-i7 processors and the extensive storage make up for the shortfall.</p>
<div id="attachment_5521" style="width: 924px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5521" class="wp-image-5521 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HP-ZBook-14u-and-15u-G6-Workstation-Laptops.jpg" alt="HP ZBook 14u and 15u G6 Workstation Laptops" width="914" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-5521" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit &#8211; HP</em></p></div>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>An exciting upgrade is the 4K screen option, offering remarkable 400 nits of brightness. You can also take things up a notch with 1080p screen alternatives and a variety of other options including protective glass anti-glare coatings, and touch support. The 14U and 15U are packed with 50-watt-hour and 56-watt-hour batteries respectively, delivering up to 14 hours per charge. This might not seem as impressive to business professionals for a mobile workstation but the fast charging feature offers a ray of hope. And yes, HP has made sure to add Sure View in Zbooks as well to block out unwanted eyes and prying co-workers.</p>
<p>Weighing just a litter under 4 pounds, the Zbooks aren&#8217;t really breaking barriers in the &#8216;lightweight&#8217; area but specs like Wi-Fi 6, LTE advanced and Bluetooth kind of takes the attention away from its minor shortcomings.</p>
<p>HP is yet to disclose the price of these workstation ultrabooks but we&#8217;ll sure know it before May 27 which is when the devices will be available for purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all remember last year at MWC 18 when Huawei unveiled their flagship Matebook X Pro that blew the consumers away with a storm. To outdo themselves this time at the Mobile World Congress 19, Huawei upgraded their already popular Matebook X Pro and also introduced a bigger (but not better) Matebook 14.</p>
<p>We believe that Huawei perfected the formula  of an ideal &#8211; good performance machine to a level that they didn&#8217;t want to fiddle much with it. So with the new Matebook X Pro, there are definitely configuration refreshes but the design, port selection and overall look and feel of the device remain the same. So, we’re left with two USB-C ports and one USB-C connector but with full Thunderbolt functionality. However, we do see a taller screen ratio than the last year on the Matebook X Pro which has improved its usability for scrolling and web surfing.</p>
<p>There is a selection of configurations you can opt for ofcourse. But the entry level MateBook X Pro will ship with an 8th generation Intel Core i5-8265U processor (going up to Core i7s for higher models). An Intel UHD Graphics 620, 8GB (going up to 16 GB) of DDR3 memory and a 256GB SSD (options going up to 1 TB). If you are feeling more adventurous and want to kick things up a notch, you can also throw in an NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics.</p>
<p>The most dramatic trend in 2019 is slim bezeled laptops. The Matebook X Pro holds a 13.9-inch display, working out a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. Yeap, I know what you are thinking, the webcam is (yet again) tucked under the keyboard making video conferences a bit awkward.</p>
<p>The aluminum body color options available for the Matebok X Pro are “Mystic Silver” and “Space Gray,” measuring only 0.57 inches in width and weighing only 2.93 lbs. There is also a fingerprint sensor within the power button for haptic login via Windows Hello.</p>
<p>Now the Matebook 14 is quite a reflection of the X Pro but only with a larger display and a bulkier body. Alongside the 14-inch screen, there is a trade between the Thunderbolt 3 port of the X Pro with a standard USB-C, an HDMI, a USB-3.0, and a USB 2.0 port. The HDMI port is sort of an unexpected treat as we can all relate with people who do NOT want to be mired in wire meshes and a dozen kind of dongles. Apart from these distinctions, it holds same keyboard, trackpad, fingerprint scanner, and embedded webcam as the pricier model. Just the quad sound system has been swapped with underside speakers on the Matebook 14.</p>
<div id="attachment_5312" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5312" class="size-full wp-image-5312" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Huawei-MateBook-14.jpg" alt="Huawei MateBook 14" width="700" height="403" /><p id="caption-attachment-5312" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Huawei MateBook 14 -MWC 2019</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The MateBook 14 is embodied in Space Gray and a lighter Mystic Silver colors as well. The specs go up to 8th generation Whiskey Lake Core i7 process, a discrete GPU (same as the X Pro), a built-in Dolby Atmos and a fingerprint sensing power button. Despite being specced almost the same, the Matebook 14 lacks the panache of the Matebook X Pro.</p>
<p>The devices are to arrive sometime in April. As per Huawei, the laptops will be boxed with a 65W charger, equipping the laptops with three hours of power backup after just 15 minutes of fast charging. The MateBook X Pro starts around $1,800, with the MateBook 14 priced from $1,360.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have seen massive diversity in almost all gadgets and devices unveiled at CES 2019. But the trend that most widely dominated all, was slim bezels. Now, Lenovo jumped into the &#8216;bezel-less&#8217; bandwagon back in 2016 with their Yoga 910 but failed to live up to that title due to the large chin of the laptop which spoiled the entire look. That is not the case this time with Lenovo&#8217;s latest creation the Yoga S940.</p>
<div id="attachment_5180" style="width: 539px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5180" class="size-full wp-image-5180" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-CES-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 Announced at CES 2019" width="529" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5180" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>This time in CES 2019, just having a weightless form factor and a wide screen wouldn&#8217;t do a new ultrabook any favors. As every second laptop displayed at the event contains just that. Gladly, Lenovo found a way around that dilemma and equipped this laptop with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The aspect that Yoga S940 focuses most on is user privacy. The Glance by Mirametrix attention-sensing AI is able to detect user presence and turning the screen on or off based on their engagement. It also keeps away nosy nellies by detecting an unwanted set of eyes on the screen of peepers. There is also a built-in eye tracking system that senses your focus and eye movement, switching the content based on its judgment.</p>
<p>Another beautiful feature is screen quality of the Yoga S940. It boasts a 13.9-inch panel with either 4K HDR400 support and 500-nit brightness or a 1080p display that comes with Dolby Vision and 400-nit brightness. The almost edge to edge screen &#8211; thanks to some seriously thin bezels, is accompanied with a curved glass that melts into the lid.</p>
<div id="attachment_5182" style="width: 819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5182" class="size-full wp-image-5182" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-contour-glass.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 contour glass" width="809" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5182" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>There are also touch-less sign-in methods enabled by the infrared (IR) camera that uses Windows Hello via facial recognition and iris scanning. And if you prefer voice login, there is also the Smart Voice technology with both Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga S940 is using 8th Gen Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. Connectivity options include two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port. So there goes the regular USB-A port which was quite expected due to the change of culture towards USB-C.</p>
<p>Lenovo will start rolling out the Yoga S940 from May 2019 pricing from $1,500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the XPS 13 as Dell came out with the fundamental model back in 2015. While the overall machine was great, the users criticized the notebook on its one particular trait — the placement of the webcam. There is hardly anyone out there who is not a sucker for slim bezels. But back in 2015, apparently, it meant relocating the camera to an inconvenient and unflattering position.</p>
<p>Well, it is 2019 now, and Dell has started the year by addressing this particular ailment and fixing the webcam issue. Instead of opting for a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push-open notch like ASUS</a>, Dell has worked on making the camera so tiny that you barely see it there. Dell says that they took their inspiration from the smartphones guidebook and opted the &#8216;active alignment technology,&#8217; that is a first for PC cameras.</p>
<div id="attachment_5131" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5131" class="size-full wp-image-5131" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Dell-XPS-13-9380-2019.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 9380 - 2019" width="828" height="580" /><p id="caption-attachment-5131" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>The new and improved XPS 13 (9380) was unveiled at CES 2019. Dell has made upgrades in other areas of the laptop as well, but the webcam fix remains the most mentionable one. Inside this svelte package, you will find the new 8th generation Whiskey Lake quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, with baser i5 and i3 options as well. There is also up to 16GB of memory, a 256 GB PCIe storage, and a glamorous  4K (3840 x 2160) touchscreen. You can also trade the touch display for a lower price with lower end specs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Buying Guide</a></strong></p>
<p>Dell might have salvaged the webcam while putting slim bezels in, but there is so much they can do. Now users have to rely on the fingerprint login instead of Windows Hello, which is a small sacrifice to make for the slim and glamorous design.</p>
<p>Dell promises a much stronger, reliable and powerful performance with the specs bump and it seems believable as well, but the claim for battery standup &#8211; not so much. The XPS 13 9380 is said to deliver 21 hours of standup on a single charge, but we won&#8217;t get too carried away until the ultrabooks are put to the test properly.</p>
<p>Dell released silver-on-black and rose gold-on-white colors with 4K touch displays while the silver-on-black option with a long-awaited Full HD touch display will be available sometime in the coming months. There&#8217;s also a new frost white color option added by Dell which comes with similar fiberglass palm rest area as the rose gold color option. It will be available with full HD non-touch and 4K touch display in few weeks.</p>
<p>These futuristic-looking ultrabooks are available starting today and are already up for sale on the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/laptops/new-13-9380/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell website</a>. Prices start from $882 to $1823 with various specs and features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2019, Razer announced an updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop, including an &#8220;Advanced Model&#8221; that comes with a 144Hz Full HD display and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<h3>Better, and More Powerful, the Updated Razer Blade 15</h3>
<p>Given the cult-like following Razer has amassed throughout the years, any product the Singapore-based gaming company releases needs very little introduction. These things pretty much hype themselves up. This includes the Razer Blade 15, which according to Razer&#8217;s announcement at CES 2019, is going to receive a nice spec upgrade.</p>
<p>For the updated Razer Blade 15, Razer decided to stick to the same dimensions and aesthetics as last year. However, the refresh is anything but on the inside. The new Razer Blade 15 will come with modest but noticeable changes under the hood. For starters, it can now come equipped with up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU. However, the other specs will remain the same with last year&#8217;s model, including the 144Hz Full HD display.</p>
<p>At its highest configuration, you&#8217;re getting an eighth-generation Intel Core i7-8750H, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and up to 512GB of fast SSD storage. This is in addition to the aforementioned NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. The entry-level model, which comes with the last-gen GPU, the NVIDIA GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU, will continue to remain on sale.</p>

<p>Razer also delighted a lot of their fans at CES 2019 with another announcement; they announced that they will be updating the widely successful <a title="Razer Blade 15 Gets Affordable Base Model and New White Color Option" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/razer-blade-15-gets-affordable-model-new-white-color-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury White edition of the Razer Blade 15</a>. The updated Razer Blade 15 Mercury White edition will now be available with either the NVIDIA RTX 2060 or the NVIDIA RTX 2070 MAX-Q GPU. Razer plans to make both configurations available for purchase online at Razer.com. However, the latter will also be made available exclusively at Best Buy.</p>
<h3>More Potential Features Down the Line</h3>
<p>Razer also showcased two potential new display technologies that could come to the Razer Blade 15 in the future.</p>
<p>The first is a 240Hz Full HD Display for an even more fluid gaming experience. Meanwhile, the second is a 4K OLED touch display that blends amazing color reproduction and efficient performance. But, that&#8217;s not all. Aside from showcasing the potential upgrades to the Razer Blade 15, Razer also announced that all the Advanced Models of the updated Razer Blade 15 will have their displays calibrated individually. Razer explains that this is to ensure &#8220;amazing color accuracy out of the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of specification differences, each Razer Blade 15 model will come with ultra-thin 4.9mm bezels and facial recognition support for Windows Hello via its IR face camera. The dual-array microphone setup for streaming, conferencing, and voice assistant use is also available across all models.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>The updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 20-series GPUs will all ship beginning January 29. This includes the Mercury Edition with the NVIDIA RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU. From the said date onwards, you can find them online at Razer.com or in select retailers in US.</p>
<p>For those who can no longer wait, the Base Model of the Razer Blade 15 is already available for purchase at select retailers and Razer.com. It will come equipped with an NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU with Max-Q design and a 60Hz Full HD display.</p>
<p>The pricing for the Razer Blade 15 will start at $1,599 for the Base Model and $2,299 for the updated Razer Blade 15 with the NVIDIA RTX 20-series GPUs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After CES 2019, it seems like slim notebooks with razor-thin bezels are the new trendsetters in the laptop market. Just like <a title="ASUS has just added a notebook with the ‘world’s slimmest bezels’ to its ZenBook line" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASUS ZenBooks</a>, Acer has also taken it upon themselves to add new, upgraded and slim bezeled notebooks to their already successful lineups.</p>
<p>Their renewed version of the Acer Swift 7 &#8211; already lauded for its slim build and portability, was unveiled at CES 2019. The new model known as the SF714-52T, takes off almost a third of a pound off of the previous Swift 7’s package. Due to its narrow frame, the bezels have shrunk to an unbelievable extent creating a wider, more engaging display. More on the design side, Acer claims the laptop&#8217;s body weight to be just 890 grams and just 9.9mm in thickness. And ofcourse, there is a 14-inch full HD touch Cornilla glass display with a fully immersive experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">With just 92 percent screen-to-body ratio, the latest Acer Swift 7 features an 8th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, 256GB or 512GB SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM. </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Acer promises a boost in the performance as well, highlighting their addition of the “Amber Lake” Intel Core processor. Acer prides their new invention for its compactness and the fact that the size does not arbitrate its productivity. A clear precedent is the inclusion of two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, and 3.5mm headphone jack all on its trim body. And even then, the device is so lightweight that it feels &#8216;barely there&#8217;. Moreover, Acer has promised the optimal performance with all-day battery life, lasting up to 10 hours on a single charge.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5018 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/acerswift72019.jpg" alt="Acer's Refreshed Swift 7 - CES 2019" width="580" height="358" /></p>
<p>But the upgrade that Swift users had desperately been waiting for is yet to be told. That&#8217;s right, the clickable touchpad. It was annoying and frustrating to use the tap to click method which gladly has now been eliminated thanks to this addition.</p>
<p>Now the only concern with slim bezels is the placement of webcams. That&#8217;s where the creativity really unfolds and shows how much thought designers have put into it. Not only did Acer add an HDR camera but also incorporated a push to open mechanism. Which not only is the best solution but also prevents unintended webcam usage which is a huge privacy invasion these days.</p>
<p>All these niceties are beautifully wrapped up inside what Acer calls a “micro-arc oxidation finish”. This gives the machine a ceramic-like look, available either in “Starfield Black” or “Moonstone White” themes.</p>
<p>While the upgraded version of the Acer Swift 7 is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor, it is delightful and also surprising to see that the upgrades have little impact on the costing. The new 2019 Swift 7 SF714-52T is to be priced around $1,699 which is almost the same as its previous version and will be available by May in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS has taken their &#8216;new year resolutions&#8217; a bit too seriously and we are not complaining. The laptop giant has just announced their two slimmest ultrabooks at <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/ces-2019/">CES 19</a>, packing some hefty features. Their 2019 lineup includes two beautiful additions to their ZenBook line. The ZenBook S13 and ZenBook 14.</p>
<p>Both ultrabooks are expected to be out in a few months. While little information is available on their pricing, the thing we know for certain is that these notebooks are not a typical case of chunk reduction like most small laptops. ASUS has made sure that the small footprint of the devices does not affect their marks and traits.</p>
<h2>Asus ZenBook 14 UX431</h2>
<p>The beefier of the two &#8211; the ASUS Zenbook 14 UX431 is nonetheless classified as a decent machine. But the Zenbook 14 does take the cake in some aspects. Such as it comes with two additional bass boosters at the bottom, providing a comparatively better and immersive sound. Adding more to this list is an HDMI port and SD card slot along with a USB Type-C port, and a standard USB 2.0 and 3.1 port in the Zenbook 14.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5014" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ZenBook-14-UX431.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14 UX431 Launched at CES 2019" width="654" height="657" /></p>
<p>While it might not have the extraordinarily slim form factor of its sibling, what it does have is the latest Whiskey Lake Intel processor. Nicely complimenting this addition is the  Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics, up to 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. One of the few reasons this model is classier by today&#8217;s standards is because of its build and chassis.</p>
<p>The ASUS Zenbook 14 packs all this amazing hardware into a slender, Utopia Blue color and the spun metal chassis. The shiny, slim device apart from looking phenomenal- weighs so light you&#8217;ll barely feel it. Weighing just under 3.2 pounds and has an 86 percent the screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s cool though is the touchpad on the Asus ZenBook 14 doubles as a numpad. It illuminates and makes up for the missing numpad on the keyboard which will be helpful while creating spreadsheets. Moreover, there is a small adjustment where when the notebook is flipped open, the lid slides a little to prop up the keyboard. This Ergolyft hinge creates a more comfortable setting for typing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers with Most Comfortable Keyboard</a></strong></p>
<p>The Asus ZenBook 14 is expected to be available sometime in early 2019 starting at $749. Which is a relief as the price tag keeps this device from being listed in the expensive range.</p>
<h2>Asus ZenBook S13 UX392</h2>
<p>Featuring a whopping 97% screen-to-body ratio. the ZenBook S13 is definitely the talk of the town. Smaller, more elegant and more premium than its sibling, this one is ASUS&#8217; new shiny trophy. This laptop has condensed the bezel size to just 2.5mm with an FHD frameless four-sided NanoEdge display. The S13 stands for everything the ZenBook line is known for. Power, with a mix of style and portability. What&#8217;s the most impressive part is that the ZenBook S13 was able to meet the demanding MIL-STD 810G military standards of durability. Which says a lot about ASUS&#8217; vision with this machine. That is to create a delicate looking all-purpose PC with the ability to withstand harshest environments.</p>
<p>All I will say is that do not get deceived by the ultra-portability of the ZenBook S13 as its roomy enough to hold an NVIDIA GeForce MX150 discrete graphics card, 1TB of PCIe x4 SSD storage, and the latest 8th Gen Intel Core Whiskey Lake quad-core processor. Asus claims that even with a comparatively smaller chassis than the ZenBook 14, its 50Wh battery will provide up to 15 hours of life. It also sports all the good bits of its sibling as well which is the illuminating touchpad cum numpad and the shiny blue chassis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5015" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-UX392.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook S13 UX392" width="720" height="512" /></p>
<p>I know what you might be thinking. The narrow bezels usually mean a poorly placed camera as there isn&#8217;t much you can cram on such a tiny bezel. Well, ASUS has found their way around that dilemma too. Thanks to the additional micro bezel or a notch (call it what you like) at the top of the screen, the camera placement has not been compromised one bit. Besides that, the notch actually helps to open the lid of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus ZenBook S13 is expected to be available around the same time as the ZenBook 14. No information about its pricing is shared by ASUS as of yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>

<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>

<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Musicians and DJs</a></strong></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4252" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-image-4252 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-9370-2018-battery-test.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 2018 - battery test" width="733" height="550"><p id="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-caption-text">Image by &#8211; forester401 on flickr</p></div>
<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3971 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="955" height="143" /></p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

All these priced at around $700 makes this a worthy contender in the current laptop’s market and thus, we&#8217;ve decided to review this for our audience. Drill down till the bottom of our review to know everything about this laptop.<span id="more-2020"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, almost all the ultrabooks these days looks akin to the Apple’s very own <a title="Checkout All MacBooks on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2kPOuqp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBooks</a> in terms of the overall form-factor and design. And the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 laptop is no exception in this case as well. There are a lot of similarities in the design of the ZenBook UX330UA and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple MacBook Air</a>. They are almost identical in size and weight and shares similar design hues, including chunkier bezels around the display, curved panel along the edges, and keyboard’s layout.</p>

<div id="attachment_2025" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2025" class="size-full wp-image-2025" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Laptop Design" width="513" height="600" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg 513w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-257x300.jpg 257w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-43x50.jpg 43w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Solid Aluminum Build</strong></p></div>
<p>Here come the other design aspects, which are not like the MacBook. The metal borders around the display are chunky and come with a large protective layer, which although looks a little awkward, but adds up to the protection of the device. The overall premium metallic shiny outer bezels on the laptop are through a layer of tiny metallic particles, on top of premium aerospace-grade aluminium, making it quite different from that of an all-metallic chassis of a MacBook.</p>
<div id="attachment_2026" style="width: 737px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-image-2026 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop Design" width="727" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design.jpg 727w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-610x420.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-600x413.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Asus UX330UA-AH54 weighs less than 3 pounds and is just 13.5mm thick!</strong></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the sides of the laptop, there are all types of ports and connectivity slots included on both sides of the laptop. We will discuss on ports and slots in more depth later in this review. On an overall note, the ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 certainly looks a lot better than most of its rivals in the segment and is surely an eye-catcher in terms of the overall design.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook sports a 13.3-inch wide-view anti-glare display protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. The display on the laptop is a LED matte panel which comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The display on the laptop is also bolstered by the IPS technology, known for providing clear and vivid display quality. The display on the laptop is a wide viewing angle which covers up to 178 degrees, for better viewing. The laptop offers a colour gamut of 72%, which is on par with most of the current display panels in this budget.</p>

<p>Moreover, during our usage, we never felt eye strains even after very prolonged usage, which is a very good aspect of this laptop. We also ran few benchmarks on the ZenBook and were surprised to look at how well the laptop’s display fares in real-time usage. In terms of brightness, the laptop offers 420 nits, which is adequate and bright even under direct sunlight. We noticed that blacks on the screen to be very accurate and punchy, which gives it the right depth of colour and image on the display.</p>

<p>All in all, the display on the Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 is really a strong point for the laptop.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware and configuration the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 offers, under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor, which comes with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz. However, the laptop can be rattled under its full potential of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. For application handling and multitasking, the laptop is provided with an 8GB of DDR3 RAM, which we felt to be a little outdated, considering its rivals having a DDR4 enabled RAMs. However, it&#8217;s the perfect blend of processor and RAM on this laptop, which didn&#8217;t let us down throughout our usage.</p>

<div id="attachment_2029" style="width: 491px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2029" class="wp-image-2029 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Fingerprint-Scanner.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop Fingerprint Scanner" width="481" height="326" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Fingerprint-Scanner.jpg 481w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Fingerprint-Scanner-300x203.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Fingerprint-Scanner-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2029" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Fingerprint Reader &#8211; One-touch login with Windows Hello</strong></p></div>
<p>As far as the storage on this laptop concerned, it comes with a 256GB of SSD storage, which should suffice most of your data. The laptop comes with a fingerprint scanner, which is a unique feature in laptops. This not only adds up to the versatility of the laptop but also ensures safety and security of the user’s privacy. For the gaming and graphics related niches, the laptop comes with the latest integrated Intel HD 620 Graphics, which although isn&#8217;t as powerful as Nvidia but is surely capable of handling most of the daily graphic related usage.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook comes with an HD webcam and the camera on the laptop is strictly average. Even under bright lighting conditions, we felt the image on the display was blurry and murky. However, the camera is quick at adjusting the image on the display and is, therefore, manageable for occasional video calls.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being an ultrabook, the Asus Zenbook UX330UA doesn&#8217;t compromise on any connectivity options. Most importantly, it sports a 3.5mm audio jack which many laptop manufacturers are planning to get rid of.</p>

<p>The laptop offers two USB 3.0 ports for faster, efficient, and reliable file transfers and a <a title="USB Type-C Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USB Type-C port</a> to deliver up to 10 times faster data transfers. In addition to them, this laptop also comes with a USB Charger+, a Micro-HDMI port, and a Micro-SD card slot.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Ultra-Slim Laptop runs Windows 10 home out-of-the-box. The software on the laptop works just fine as that of any other laptop running Windows 10. The software on the laptop is productive, efficient, fast, and reliable but has its own drawbacks. The laptop is stuffed with some bloatware, which we felt was quite unnecessary for most of the users.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the ZenBook comes stuffed with a latest seventh gen intel core i5 processor paired with an 8GB of RAM. This duo is now commonly seen on most of the latest laptops at this budget. Although these specifications are any groundbreaking, they certainly offer very reliable and stable overall performance. The RAM and system memory is very well managed in this ultrabook.</p>
<p>During our usage, we&#8217;ve put the laptop to its full potential. We ran multiple RAM and processing power consuming benchmarking apps to which the laptop responded really well. Switching between apps, multitasking, gesture support, and other essential performance aspects on this laptop are pretty convincing. During our entire usage, we hardly noticed a performance issues. In fact, we loved how the laptop responded to the heavy applications.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Speaking about the gaming aspect of the laptop, it comes with an integrated Intel HD 620 graphics, which is one of the most advanced graphics integrated with an Intel chipset. The graphic reproduction and handling of the laptop are pretty neat and tidy. Although one cannot expect a powerful gaming experience on this laptop, almost all the modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook 3 is unarguably a multimedia-stationed laptop. This aforementioned statement is bolstered by its powerful Harman Kardon audio paired with ASUS’s proprietary Golden Ear team to produce an unmatched and unsurpassed distortion-free sound. The laptop comes with the SonicMaster technology for tuning audio and sports a 4-Channel, 5-magnet enabled, Quad-Speakers for a powerful audio experience.</p>
<div id="attachment_2031" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2031" class="wp-image-2031 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop.jpg" alt="Harman Kardon Audio on Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop" width="611" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop.jpg 611w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-300x196.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-610x399.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-600x393.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Harman-Kardon-Audio-on-Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Ultimate Sounding Speakers by Harman Kardon</strong></p></div>
<p>Moreover, the laptop also comes with a smart-Amp audio technology option, which lets you setup the audio as per the user’s choice. Speaking about the video playback abilities, the laptop can play 4K content with ease, and thanks to its super wide viewing angles, watching videos on this laptop is a pleasure.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Speaking about battery life of the ASUS ZenBook, the laptop is fuelled with a 57 Wh polymer battery pack. The battery packed in the laptop is pretty much sufficient to provide a backup of around 5-10 hours based on the usage. The laptop can be fully charged in around 2 hours 30 minutes. During our review, the laptop survived for 8 hours in video playback test, where we played 4k content with around 40% of brightness. Do note that, these figures can increase or decrease based on the usage. On a conclusive note, the battery could have been much better for a laptop this calibre as the MacBook Air with the almost similar set of configuration lasts at least 3 hours more than our current contender.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1932" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54-Best-Ultrabook-Under-$700" width="550" height="320" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-300x175.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-515x300.jpg 515w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />With all that said, we’d like to conclude saying that the ASUS ZenBook is undoubtedly one of the most polished and performance-oriented laptops in the segment. The laptop has few weaker zones, but thankfully, it also has a lot of other aspects which are very well-tuned making it an able <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contender in around a budget of $700</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for an eye-catchy premium looking daily performer, then the ASUS ZenBook is surely a worth considering option. Also note that there are hardly any able laptops in this price range and you&#8217;ll need to spend few hundreds additionally to get a better option such as Dell XPS 13, or the MacBook Air.</p>
