<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What you&#8217;ll notice with most of the Surface Pro 7 discounts is that they are paired with a type cover. This bundled discount means that Microsoft and other resellers are aiming to make sales on this device more tempting. Another reason is that it&#8217;s a relatively new model that was launched just a couple of months ago. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a bundled offer is your preference, Amazon is running an offer for Surface 7 Pro with Type Cover <a href="https://amzn.to/2UjN4Hl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bundle <span class="s2">at $789</span></a>, saving you $200.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If your work requires more computational power, here is a powerful Surface Pro 7 that comes with Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 256GB internal storage priced at <a href="https://amzn.to/3baqGXI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,297.00 <span class="s2">at Amazon</span></a>; offering you a discount of $200. If you think that 256GB won&#8217;t cut it for you, then the Surface Pro 7 with Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD is available for <a href="https://amzn.to/3ddCk68" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,697 on Amazon</a>, saving you $200.</span></p>

The offer stands only for Black color and you also get Surface Signature Type Cover with the hardware. There are plenty of specifications that you can choose from in Surface Pro 6 deal on Amazon. For example, Surface Pro 6 running on the same Intel Core i5 processor but having 256GB SSD can be purchased for <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2rCW9jO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="s2">$878.99 from Amazon</span></a> ($120 OFF).</span></p>

<p>If you are one of those who have to stay connected to the internet, the Surface Pro X is for you. Unlike Surface Pro 7, the Surface Pro X has 4G LTE built-in, so no more finding Wi-Fi hotspots.
