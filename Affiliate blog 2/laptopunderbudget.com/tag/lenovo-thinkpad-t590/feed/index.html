										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where most manufacturers use the Mobile World Congress as a platform to announce their latest mobile gadgets, Lenovo used MWC 2019 to announce their latest line of refreshed ThinkPad T Series and X series laptop, set to release in June later this year.</p>
<p>Easily the most well-known and popular of their ThinkPad line of laptops, the latest refreshes all share one trait in common — all of them will be equipped with the latest Intel Whiskey Lake processors.</p>
<h2>Say Hello to the Refreshed ThinkPad T Series Laptops</h2>
<p>The headliner of the latest refreshed T Series laptops is the Lenovo ThinkPad T490s.</p>
<p>Released as the successor to the widely popular Lenovo Thinkpad T480s, the T490s sports a thinner chassis at 0.63-inches over the T480s&#8217; 0.72-inch chassis. Also, it can come equipped with up to a super bright 500-nit HDR screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. An option to have slightly less brighter 400-nit, 1920 x 1080 display is also available for those who are willing to sacrifice aesthetics for a longer battery life. Both versions of the T490s&#8217; 14-inch screen will come with a PrivacyGuard panel to help hide the content of your screen from prying eyes.</p>
<p>Specs-wise, the T490s can come with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD, 32GB of DDR4 ram, and a battery expected to last up to 20 hours unplugged.</p>
<div id="attachment_5331" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-image-5331 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Refreshed-T400-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Refreshed T400 Laptops" width="1200" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-caption-text"><i>Image &#8211; Lenovo</i></p></div>
<p>Next up is the entry-level ThinkPad T490, the follow-up to the ThinkPad T480. It has a much-thinner bezel compared to its predecessor and comes with the same set of privacy features as the T490s, as well as an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card upgrade and the same 500-nit, 2560 x 1440 resolution HDR display.</p>
<p>Finally, their bulkiest and biggest of them all, the T590 will use the additional real estate to over a high-res 4K display, complete with 500 nits of brightness and Dolby Vision color.</p>
<p>Similar to the T490, the T590 can come equipped with an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card. It will also feature the new single-battery RapidCharge technology by Lenovo and will be nearly half a pound lighter compared to the 4.29-pound ThinkPad T580 at just 3.87 pounds.</p>
<h2>Expected Released Date of the Refreshed ThinkPad Laptops</h2>
<p>All three of the refreshed T Series laptops will arrive sometime in June in the United States. However, those in Europe can have their hands on the T490 and the T590 as early as this March; the T490s will arrive in Europe in April.</p>
<p>As for the pricing, the T490 is the cheapest of the bunch with a starting price point of $999. The T590 is next at $1,029, followed by the T490s at $1,279.</p>
