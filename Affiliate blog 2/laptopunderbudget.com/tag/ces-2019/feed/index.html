										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Gigabyte gaming laptops garnered a lot of attention at CES 2019, and it&#8217;s not only because the Aorus 15 and Aero 15 are both set to receive noteworthy hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>Released in collaboration with Microsoft, the new Gigabyte gaming laptops will feature the Microsoft Azure AI. This industry-first artificial intelligence was programmed to fully optimize the laptop&#8217;s performance based on the user&#8217;s previous pattern of use.</p>
<h2>Gigabyte Gives the Aorus 15 a Price Cut and a Modest Spec Bump</h2>
<p>Compared to its more expensive predecessors, the Aorus 15 will be priced relatively cheaper, putting it firmly within the mainstream range. However, make no mistake, this laptop retains the same premium aesthetics and performance &#8212; just without the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>Featuring the Microsoft Azure AI, where if enabled, will pull data from previously stored information on the software that you&#8217;re currently using and will optimize everything necessary for ideal performance, whether you&#8217;re playing video games or processing media.</p>
<div id="attachment_5190" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5190" class=" wp-image-5190" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aorus-15-with-RTX.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15 with RTX GPUs and Microsoft Azure AI" width="715" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5190" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>At its most expensive configuration, users can opt to equip the Aorus 15 with the latest Intel Core i7-8750H processor; an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU; 16GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 32GB); and finally, two 2TB of fast SSD storage to give you all of the space that you could possibly ever need.</p>
<p>Weighing at just over 5 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Aorus 15 is not the sleekest nor the lightest gaming laptop. However, it is beautiful. In particular, half of the &#8220;under chassis&#8221; is full of heat pipes and fans. This gives the laptop a premium look, more akin to that of a luxury sports car&#8217;s engine.</p>
<p>Other features include a 15.6-inch Full HD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, a three-zone RGB lighting keyboard, Windows precision drivers for the touchpad, as well as the NAHIMIC audio software for a truly immersive gaming experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500</a></strong></p>
<h2>The Gigabyte Aero 15 Is One of the Smartest Gaming Laptops Around</h2>
<p>Specced out to its maximum configuration, the Aero 15 will come equipped with the Intel Core i9-8950HK; a top-of-the-line Nvidia GTX 2080 MAX-Q GPU; 32GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 64GB); and two 2TB SSDs to satisfy all of your storage needs.</p>
<p>Lighter and slimmer compared to the Aorus 15, the Aero 15 weighs just shy of 5 pounds. It&#8217;s also markedly thinner at just 0.74 inches thick. To match the svelte nature of the laptop, Gigabyte equipped the Aero 15 with a 15.6-inch display with ultra thin bezels. Users can choose to configure the monitor to come at 3840 x 2160 resolution (or 4K), and cover a whopping 100% of the Adobe RGB spectrum for maximum eye candy.</p>
<div id="attachment_5191" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5191" class="size-full wp-image-5191" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aero-15-2019-with-RTX-and-Azure-AI.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aero 15 2019 with RTX GPU and Azure AI" width="497" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-5191" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>Speaking of eye candy, users can customize each key on the keyboard. The Aero 15 comes decked out with a fully customizable RGB keyboard.</p>
<p>Of course, similar to its thicker and bulkier cousin, the Aero 15 will also feature the industry-first Microsoft Azure AI. This means, from the CPU and GPU to the RGB backlit keyboard, fans, and even sound effect settings, the software can optimize everything to fit user preferences and all users have to do is to press a single button.</p>
<p>The Gigabyte Aero 15 will also come with other notable features. This includes the long-awaited Windows precision drivers for the touchpad; 7.1 virtual surround sound courtesy of NAHIMIC 3; and batteries that Gigabyte claim can last up to 10 hours on a single charge.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Excited customers won&#8217;t have to wait long to get their hands on the AI-powered Gigabyte gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Both Gigabyte gaming laptops will start shipping at the end of January. The Aorus 15 will start at a more affordable price point of $1,799. Meanwhile, the Aero 15 will start selling for $2,299. The Aero 15 is also available at a discounted price of $2,199 for those who buy two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have seen massive diversity in almost all gadgets and devices unveiled at CES 2019. But the trend that most widely dominated all, was slim bezels. Now, Lenovo jumped into the &#8216;bezel-less&#8217; bandwagon back in 2016 with their Yoga 910 but failed to live up to that title due to the large chin of the laptop which spoiled the entire look. That is not the case this time with Lenovo&#8217;s latest creation the Yoga S940.</p>
<div id="attachment_5180" style="width: 539px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5180" class="size-full wp-image-5180" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-CES-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 Announced at CES 2019" width="529" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5180" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>This time in CES 2019, just having a weightless form factor and a wide screen wouldn&#8217;t do a new ultrabook any favors. As every second laptop displayed at the event contains just that. Gladly, Lenovo found a way around that dilemma and equipped this laptop with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The aspect that Yoga S940 focuses most on is user privacy. The Glance by Mirametrix attention-sensing AI is able to detect user presence and turning the screen on or off based on their engagement. It also keeps away nosy nellies by detecting an unwanted set of eyes on the screen of peepers. There is also a built-in eye tracking system that senses your focus and eye movement, switching the content based on its judgment.</p>
<p>Another beautiful feature is screen quality of the Yoga S940. It boasts a 13.9-inch panel with either 4K HDR400 support and 500-nit brightness or a 1080p display that comes with Dolby Vision and 400-nit brightness. The almost edge to edge screen &#8211; thanks to some seriously thin bezels, is accompanied with a curved glass that melts into the lid.</p>
<div id="attachment_5182" style="width: 819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5182" class="size-full wp-image-5182" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-contour-glass.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 contour glass" width="809" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5182" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>There are also touch-less sign-in methods enabled by the infrared (IR) camera that uses Windows Hello via facial recognition and iris scanning. And if you prefer voice login, there is also the Smart Voice technology with both Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga S940 is using 8th Gen Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. Connectivity options include two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port. So there goes the regular USB-A port which was quite expected due to the change of culture towards USB-C.</p>
<p>Lenovo will start rolling out the Yoga S940 from May 2019 pricing from $1,500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Dell&#8217;s subsidiary, Alienware, was focused on making headlines, Dell decided to appeal more to the mass consumer at CES 2019, announcing a refresh to their budget-friendly G series gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The next-generation laptops, the Dell G5 15, G7 15 and G7 17, are set to receive upgrades to both its internal components and aesthetics, with the more affordable line of gaming laptops starting to look more like their Alienware cousins.</p>
<h2>Affordability and Power Packed In a 15-inch Chassis</h2>
<div id="attachment_5155" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-image-5155 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>Where most refreshes only touch up on the hardware side of things, Dell also changed up the aesthetics of their G series gaming laptops for 2019. Instead of their more subtle look, they&#8217;re starting to look more like <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/alienware-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware laptops</a>. Case in point, by default, the Dell G7 15 and G5 15 will both come in Deep Space Black color options, decked out with blue-colored accents. Finally, rounding out its look are ridges located right around the border, which Dell presumably put both for aesthetic and functional purposes.</p>
<p>Another laptop, the Dell G5 15 SE, is also available as an upgrade. It features the same specs as the Dell G5 15. However, it comes with an Alpine White chassis and a clear panel on the bottom of the system that showcases the cooling system, which Dell equipped with blue fans.</p>
<p>The key difference between the G5 15 and the G7 15 is that the latter is thinner and weighs less. At just 0.78 inches and 5.77 pounds, the Dell G7 15 has slightly different dimensions compared to the Dell G5 15, which tips the scales at 6.1 pounds and is at least 0.95 inches thick.</p>
<p>Both of these G series gaming laptops come packing with the latest Quad- and Hex-core Cofee Lake Intel processors, as well as mobile versions of NVIDIA&#8217;s RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can opt to upgrade the display of the latest G series gaming laptops. For more eye candy, users can choose a 4K UHD, OLED display. Meanwhile, for serious and competitive gamers, the G5 15 and the G7 15 comes with a 144Hz Full HD display panel as well.</p>
<h2>An Inexpensive i9-Powered, 17-inch Laptop That Packs a Wallop</h2>
<div id="attachment_5156" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-image-5156 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-3.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>From the more budget friendly G series gaming laptops, we go to the slightly more expensive, but still affordable, G7 17.</p>
<p>Weighing at 7.21 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Dell G7 17 is slightly bigger than its 15-inch brothers. Yet, at the same time, it&#8217;s also leaner compared to <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other 17-inch gaming laptops</a>. It also comes with the same Deep Space Black theme as its 15-inch varieties, and unfortunately, won&#8217;t be available in Alpine White.</p>
<p>Powered by the latest Intel Core i9 processor, the G7 17 is dramatically more powerful and faster compared to the G5 15 and the G7 15. However, other specifications, including the NVIDIA RTX graphics cards, which tops out with the RTX 2080, remains the same across all three (or four including the G5 15 SE) gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dell has limited the 17-inch laptop to a Full HD display. However, users can choose to have it equipped with a 144Hz screen for a smoother gameplay experience.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Dell announced that all of the refreshed G series gaming laptops will start shipping on January 21.</p>
<p>The Dell G5 15 will start at $999, with the thinner and lighter Dell G7 15 starting at $1,099, and the Alpine White Dell G5 15 SE being available as an upgrade option. Finally, the Dell G7 17 will start at a $1,379 price point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eyebrow-raising and potentially, industry-shaking, Dell&#8217;s gaming-focused division, Alienware, turned a lot of heads at CES 2019 with their unveiling of the Alienware Area 51m.</p>
<p>Alienware, quite literally, released a desktop in laptop form at CES 2019. The Alienware Area 51m is a maxed out gaming laptop that comes with a fully upgradeable CPU and GPU. Yes, you read that right. You&#8217;ll be able to upgrade the laptop&#8217;s already impressive hardware down the line when you feel like it.</p>
<p>Just as when other manufacturers were looking at making their laptops thinner and thinner, Dell and Alienware took a decidedly different, but welcome, route.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s New with the Alienware Area 51m</h2>
<p>Dell claims that the Alienware Area 51m is the most powerful gaming laptop in the world right now. It comes with various configuration options. However, at its best, users can fit the Alienware Area 51m with a class-leading Intel Core i9-9900k CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. But, it&#8217;s not just the hardware that makes the desktop-turned-laptop stand out. It&#8217;s also what you can do with the insides of the gaming laptop down the line that makes it unique.</p>
<p>Alienware decided to revisit an idea from one of their former products with the Alienware Area 51m and have made the gaming laptop fully upgradeable. This means that users can upgrade its graphics card and processor in the future. Of course, as expected, users can also upgrade both the storage and the memory (up to 64GB of RAM). This gives the Alienware Area 51m long-term viability.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, though. A potential problem is that users can only source the swappable &#8220;Dell Graphics Form Factor&#8221;, otherwise known as DGFF, graphics cards, from a limited choice of suppliers.</p>
<div id="attachment_5135" style="width: 1120px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5135" class="wp-image-5135 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Alienware-Area-51m-2.jpg" alt="Alienware Area 51m" width="1110" height="460" /><p id="caption-attachment-5135" class="wp-caption-text">The all-new Alienware Area 51m gaming laptop</p></div>
<p>Aesthetically, the Alienware Area 51m certainly isn&#8217;t the sleekest gaming laptop around. The 17-inch chassis, equipped with a 17.3-inch panel, is huge, to say the least. Just like the hardware, the screen is available in various configurations. This includes a 60Hz display; a 60Hz display with G-Sync; a 144Hz with Tobii eye tracking; a 144Hz display with G-sync, and finally, a 144Hz display with both G-Sync and Tobii eye tracking.</p>

<p>Weighing in at just 8.53 pounds, the Alienware Area 51m is surprisingly not that heavy.</p>
<p>Other specifications include a multi-colored keyboard, power on tap, a huge <span class="st">90Wh battery, </span>and a hefty cooling system.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Alienware failed to provide any details regarding which models the introduction price will cover. However, they did go on to announce that they will ship out the Alienware Area 51m starting at the end of the month (January). Prices will start at a whopping, but understandable, $2,549.</p>
<p>Alienware also added that they will start shipping out more affordable configurations of the Alienware Area 51m later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the XPS 13 as Dell came out with the fundamental model back in 2015. While the overall machine was great, the users criticized the notebook on its one particular trait — the placement of the webcam. There is hardly anyone out there who is not a sucker for slim bezels. But back in 2015, apparently, it meant relocating the camera to an inconvenient and unflattering position.</p>
<p>Well, it is 2019 now, and Dell has started the year by addressing this particular ailment and fixing the webcam issue. Instead of opting for a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push-open notch like ASUS</a>, Dell has worked on making the camera so tiny that you barely see it there. Dell says that they took their inspiration from the smartphones guidebook and opted the &#8216;active alignment technology,&#8217; that is a first for PC cameras.</p>
<div id="attachment_5131" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5131" class="size-full wp-image-5131" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Dell-XPS-13-9380-2019.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 9380 - 2019" width="828" height="580" /><p id="caption-attachment-5131" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>The new and improved XPS 13 (9380) was unveiled at CES 2019. Dell has made upgrades in other areas of the laptop as well, but the webcam fix remains the most mentionable one. Inside this svelte package, you will find the new 8th generation Whiskey Lake quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, with baser i5 and i3 options as well. There is also up to 16GB of memory, a 256 GB PCIe storage, and a glamorous  4K (3840 x 2160) touchscreen. You can also trade the touch display for a lower price with lower end specs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Buying Guide</a></strong></p>
<p>Dell might have salvaged the webcam while putting slim bezels in, but there is so much they can do. Now users have to rely on the fingerprint login instead of Windows Hello, which is a small sacrifice to make for the slim and glamorous design.</p>
<p>Dell promises a much stronger, reliable and powerful performance with the specs bump and it seems believable as well, but the claim for battery standup &#8211; not so much. The XPS 13 9380 is said to deliver 21 hours of standup on a single charge, but we won&#8217;t get too carried away until the ultrabooks are put to the test properly.</p>
<p>Dell released silver-on-black and rose gold-on-white colors with 4K touch displays while the silver-on-black option with a long-awaited Full HD touch display will be available sometime in the coming months. There&#8217;s also a new frost white color option added by Dell which comes with similar fiberglass palm rest area as the rose gold color option. It will be available with full HD non-touch and 4K touch display in few weeks.</p>
<p>These futuristic-looking ultrabooks are available starting today and are already up for sale on the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/laptops/new-13-9380/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell website</a>. Prices start from $882 to $1823 with various specs and features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to be outdone, Lenovo unveiled a lot at CES 2019, including a refresh of their Legion gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Taking center stage to unveil their new Legion Y740 (17-inch and 15-inch) and Y540 (15-inch) models, which are both refreshes of the Y730 and Y530 gaming laptops that they released last year, Lenovo&#8217;s latest line of gaming laptops will both be equipped with the latest Intel 8th Gen Processors and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.</p>
<h2 class="speakableTextP1">What&#8217;s New with the Legion Gaming Laptops?</h2>
<p>For the Legion Y740, users can opt for various configurations per unit. This includes the option to have up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM installed, as well as either a 15-inch or a 17-inch display with optional 144Hz refresh rate and NVIDIA G-SYNC support. Both device sizes will also come equipped with beautiful RGB backlit keys powered by the iCUE software by Corsair; support for Dolby Vision HDR software for ultra-vivid picture quality; a significantly brighter screen at up to 500 nits; and finally, a Dolby Atmos Speaker System with Dolby Sound Radar for improved audio quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while both devices can come with either the Intel Core i5-8300H or Intel Core i7-8750H, only the 17-inch model can come equipped with the latest the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU, while the 15-inch model will have to &#8220;settle&#8221; with the NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<div id="attachment_5107" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-image-5107 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Legion-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Legion Gaming Laptops" width="900" height="549" /><p id="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-caption-text">The Lenovo Legion Y740</p></div>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, the more affordable 15-inch gaming laptop won&#8217;t lag too far behind its bigger siblings in terms of specs. It will come equipped with a yet unannounced Intel Core processor and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU. Also, at only 5.1 pounds, what the Y540 lacks in power, it makes up for with portability. Lenovo also equipped the Y540 with Harman Kardon speakers and support for Dolby Atmos for an immersive gaming experience, as well as a white backlit keyboard with a response time of under 1ms.</p>
<p>Other important notable features available across all models include support for various storage options (512GB PCIe SSD, 512GB SATA SSD, and a 2TB SATA HDD), a better cooling system, longer battery life, and an improved aluminum display hinge for added monitor stability.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Lenovo plans to make their latest line of Legion gaming laptops available later this year.</p>
<p>Lenovo will begin shipping out the 15-inch and 17-inch Legion Y740 laptops first in February. The 15-inch model will start at $1,749.99 and the 17-inch model will start at $1,979.99.</p>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, Lenovo will start shipping the lower-specced laptops out in May starting at $929.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2019, Razer announced an updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop, including an &#8220;Advanced Model&#8221; that comes with a 144Hz Full HD display and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<h3>Better, and More Powerful, the Updated Razer Blade 15</h3>
<p>Given the cult-like following Razer has amassed throughout the years, any product the Singapore-based gaming company releases needs very little introduction. These things pretty much hype themselves up. This includes the Razer Blade 15, which according to Razer&#8217;s announcement at CES 2019, is going to receive a nice spec upgrade.</p>
<p>For the updated Razer Blade 15, Razer decided to stick to the same dimensions and aesthetics as last year. However, the refresh is anything but on the inside. The new Razer Blade 15 will come with modest but noticeable changes under the hood. For starters, it can now come equipped with up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU. However, the other specs will remain the same with last year&#8217;s model, including the 144Hz Full HD display.</p>
<p>At its highest configuration, you&#8217;re getting an eighth-generation Intel Core i7-8750H, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and up to 512GB of fast SSD storage. This is in addition to the aforementioned NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. The entry-level model, which comes with the last-gen GPU, the NVIDIA GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU, will continue to remain on sale.</p>

<p>Razer also delighted a lot of their fans at CES 2019 with another announcement; they announced that they will be updating the widely successful <a title="Razer Blade 15 Gets Affordable Base Model and New White Color Option" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/razer-blade-15-gets-affordable-model-new-white-color-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury White edition of the Razer Blade 15</a>. The updated Razer Blade 15 Mercury White edition will now be available with either the NVIDIA RTX 2060 or the NVIDIA RTX 2070 MAX-Q GPU. Razer plans to make both configurations available for purchase online at Razer.com. However, the latter will also be made available exclusively at Best Buy.</p>
<h3>More Potential Features Down the Line</h3>
<p>Razer also showcased two potential new display technologies that could come to the Razer Blade 15 in the future.</p>
<p>The first is a 240Hz Full HD Display for an even more fluid gaming experience. Meanwhile, the second is a 4K OLED touch display that blends amazing color reproduction and efficient performance. But, that&#8217;s not all. Aside from showcasing the potential upgrades to the Razer Blade 15, Razer also announced that all the Advanced Models of the updated Razer Blade 15 will have their displays calibrated individually. Razer explains that this is to ensure &#8220;amazing color accuracy out of the box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of specification differences, each Razer Blade 15 model will come with ultra-thin 4.9mm bezels and facial recognition support for Windows Hello via its IR face camera. The dual-array microphone setup for streaming, conferencing, and voice assistant use is also available across all models.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>The updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 20-series GPUs will all ship beginning January 29. This includes the Mercury Edition with the NVIDIA RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU. From the said date onwards, you can find them online at Razer.com or in select retailers in US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MSI are the latest in the long line of gaming laptop manufacturers to unveil their newest and latest RTX gaming laptops at CES 2019.</p>
<p>For 2019, MSI will usher in three new RTX gaming laptops into the market: the GS75 Stealth laptop, the PS63 Modern laptop, and the GE75 Raider laptop.</p>
<p>Each gaming laptop in their latest lineup is aimed towards catering to a specific target audience, but all three are made to help reaffirm MSI&#8217;s &#8220;position as an industry leader endorsed by gamers and eSports teams worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside their RTX gaming laptops, MSI also used CES 2019 to announce several of their latest products as well. This includes a new pre-built desktop, a new desktop case, a new gaming keyboard, and their newest line of high-performance graphics cards, spearheaded by the MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GAMING X TRIO.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to MSI&#8217;s RTX Gaming Laptops</h3>
<p>Leading the charge for MSI&#8217;s newest RTX gaming laptops is the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop. Coming in at just 0.75 inches thick and sporting a thin bezel design, all housed in an aluminum alloy body for a premium look, the GS75 is meant to stand out aesthetically. Specs-wise, the GS75 doesn&#8217;t lag behind its competition either. It comes with a huge 17.3-inch 144Hz IPS-level display, the latest Intel Core i7 series CPUs, and perhaps more importantly, the NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU.</p>
<div id="attachment_5094" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-image-5094 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MSI-GS75-Stealth-17-inch-Thin-and-Light-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GS75 Stealth 17 inch Thin and Light Gaming Laptop" width="578" height="408" /><p id="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>MSI GS75 Stealth</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The GS75&#8217;s smaller brother, the GS65, is also receiving an update for the new year as well. The newest version of the 15.6-inch gaming laptop that weighs just 4.19 pounds will include the best and latest CPUs and GPUs the market has to offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 &#8211; Our Top Picks</a></strong></p>
<p>Next up is the PS63 Modern. A laptop built for another market entirely, it is not the same beast of a gaming laptop that the GS75 is. At just 0.63 inches thick and 3.53 pounds, the PS63 Modern is perfect for content creators who are looking for a lightweight laptop that can doesn&#8217;t lag behind in terms of performance. It comes equipped with up to an Intel Core i7 processor and up to an NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU. More importantly, it has a 16-hour battery life and MSI&#8217;s own proprietary software called the &#8220;Creator Center&#8221; aimed specifically towards people who use creator software frequently.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not the least, is the GE75 Raider gaming laptop. Much like the GS75, it comes equipped with the latest NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. However, different from the GS75, the GE75 will feature a thicker, more gamerish aesthetic, complete with a reflective diamond cut trim and a red anodized finish for a more aggressive look.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, MSI didn&#8217;t unveil any details regarding when the general public will have a chance to get their hands on their latest RTX gaming laptops. However, many expect the Taiwan-based company to release more information regarding about the pricing and the availability of their RTX gaming laptops pretty soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far as CES 2019 is concerned, ASUS has been at the top of their game. They have come up with the most accessible, yet innovative solutions to cater to almost every kind of audience. Not a few days ago, ASUS introduced <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-officially-unveils-four-new-chromebooks-ces-2019/">rugged and thick notebooks for students and kids</a> &#8211; able to withstand almost any sort drop and bump that you can imagine. Now, they are back with a more premium and exquisite version of their well-worshipped Flip C302, named the Chromebook Flip C434.</p>
<p>The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 boasts a beautiful edge-to-edge screen and the signature Flip 360 hinge as its main attractions. The chassis is an all-metal aluminum body weighing just about 3.3 pounds and is only 15.7 mm thick. The rough rubber might be durable but there is just something about a silver metal finish you can&#8217;t turn away from. Plus its a good camouflage for those nasty fingerprints as well. The 2-in-1 book&#8217;s 360 ErgoLift hinge transforms the device into a traditional laptop, tablet, and tent modes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5087" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C434-1.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook Flip C434" width="599" height="498" /></p>
<p>Now, the ASUS Flip C302 was a classic success among budget users no doubt, as it provided great value for money. The Flip C434 not only does maintain the same aspect but also comes with a bunch of new upgrades. For instance now there is support for Intel’s 8th Gen Y-Series (choice between an i7-8500Y, i5-8200Y, or M3-8100Y) CPUs and the addition of a USB-A port. Apart from the affordability, there are still a lot of similarities left between the older and the latest version. Like the 8GB of RAM, upto 128GB of storage, and the microSD card slot.</p>
<p>The reason ASUS is able to offer premium looks, mid-range price, portability, and a good processor is due to the lightweight ChromeOS. This lightweight operating system has been a long companion of budget users and comes in good looking books as well. Just like the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 which stands out with its Full HD NanoEdge 14-inch touchscreen display. And that too with maintaining the very &#8216;in&#8217; trend of slim bezels which are just 5mm on this one. What&#8217;s even more impressive is that they have still to fit in a front facing camera at the top.</p>
<p>ASUS also hasn&#8217;t lost the chiclet keyboard that provides one of the most comfortable typing experiences and is also backlit. And thanks to the flexible hinge, the experience just gets better.</p>

<p>ASUS has announced this all-purpose premium ultrabook to be out in a few months. For the price &#8211; ASUS points out that instead of going overboard with either fancy specs or huge savings, they have decided to level both and offer surpassing specs within a mid-range cost and is offering its notebook with a starting price of $569.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaming on a big screen laptop often means added weight. This is something that we have seen in the past few years, but the new Alienware m17 offers a 17-inch screen and impressive performance without the extra weight. In fact, it is 40% lighter than the Alienware 17 and weighs only 5.79 lbs. This is very impressive indeed for a laptop that does not compromise on performance and offers a <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17-inch display</a>.</p>
<p>Powering the laptop is an Intel 8th-gen Intel Core i9 processor and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q GPUs. Both of these are based on the latest architectures and will provide impressive performance even in a laptop form factor. Dell claims to be using an exceptional cooling solution in order to keep the hardware cool under load, but that is something that we will have to see for ourselves before we can make a comment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5056 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/m17-4-700x467-c.jpg" alt="Alienware m17" width="700" height="467" />The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q GPUs are designed for thin and light gaming laptops and have a lower TDP, but they offer the same features as the standard versions. So not only are you getting Nvidia RTX real-time ray tracing support but DLSS as well. The Alienware m17 will be available in Epic Silver and Nebula Red. Even though the device is thin and light, it is strong and durable due to the use of premium materials like magnesium alloy and copper.</p>

<p>The company has also given a specs bump to its first-ever thin and light gaming laptop — <a title="Alienware m15 – The First Thin and Light Alienware Gaming Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/alienware-m15-first-thin-light-gaming-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware m15</a> which was launched in October last year. You can now configure it with up to Intel Core i9 processor and new Nvidia RTX 20 series graphics.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the Alienware&#8217;s new 17-inch thin and light gaming laptop and whether or not this is something that you would be interested in getting for yourself.</p>
