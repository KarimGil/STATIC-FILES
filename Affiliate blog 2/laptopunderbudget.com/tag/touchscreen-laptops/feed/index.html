										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has been one of the initial companies to partner with the Google’s Chrome OS project. The laptop manufacturing company is globally renowned to provide value for money laptops in various categories. Likewise, the Chromebook R11 is a unique notebook in the segment of Chrome OS-powered laptops. Unlike, most of the other Chromebooks, the R11 is a convertible laptop, which can be used in various modes thanks to its 360-degree hinges. The versatile and 2-in-1 laptops are becoming increasingly popular among the people these days.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Acer Chromebook R11 is also a convertible laptop stuffed with some interesting set of hardware and specifications, which makes it one of the powerful <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook under $300</a>. It has won various accolades worldwide from common users to the tech community.</p>
<p>The R11 is promised to provide a comfortable user experience, competent performance with its long lasting battery life. But is the Google’s browser-stationed Chrome OS designed to be used with a touchscreen display? Is it powerful enough to handle our everyday essentials? Without further delay, let’s drill down to know how this laptop fares under various use-cases and circumstances.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, here&#8217;s a quick overview of its hardware specifications &#8211;</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are inevitably difficult to be made. Reason? They have to stay inexpensive yet provide good performance and the most difficult part, it has to compete with the market that’s now full of Chromebooks available for dirt cheap prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3310" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11" width="469" height="332" /></p>
<p>The R11 is launched with a base price of under $300 and therefore, it has to deliver a lot for the asking price. As far as the design and built factor are concerned, the R11 comes with an 11.6-inch screen size which is decked out in a very clean and tidy chassis. The laptop comes with a diamond patterned finish from the outside which gives an additional level of grip, making it easy to hold and carry. Although the company (Acer) claims that the outer lid of the laptop is made up of aluminum, we felt that it was feeble and the design wasn’t very solidly built.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 - Lid" width="372" height="260" /></p>
<p>Having that said, the laptop offers great ergonomics, which you hardly get at this price point. The device comes with compact measurements at 11.6 x 8.03 x 0.76 inches which fit well in bags. Moreover, it weighs just about 2.7 pounds, which is yet another add-on.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a 360-degrees hinge, which is the core of its convertible aspect. The laptop flips well and can be used in four different modes.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen HD WideScreen LED-backlit display with a resolution of 1366&#215;768 pixels. The screen comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which now is a standard and common thing we see in most of the laptops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible - Display" width="700" height="507" /></p>
<p>The laptop offers good color gamut and also manages to provide decent viewing angles. However, what made us disappointed is that the laptop’s display is not adequately bright which makes the outdoor usage a bit cumbersome. Even at the brightness set to maximum, the display didn’t felt very bright, which affects the crispness and contrasts of the regular usage. During our benchmarking, the laptop managed to score a mere 225 nits of brightness, which is subpar considering its contenders which manage to score over 300 nits.</p>
<p>When we put the laptop display’s color reproduction to test, we got a decent 74% of sRGB spectrum, which is very well on top of other Chromebooks priced similarly. We also used the device to watch some high-quality movies and other content, to which the display responded well and gave us a decent experience minus the brightness.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C1LK) is stuffed with decent specifications for the asking price. The device is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor paired with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM. The processor, however, can be throttled up to 2.08GHz through the Intel’s Burst technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The display as mentioned above is an 11.6-inch HD display, which comes with a 10-point multi-touch support. Storage segment on the device is backed by a 32GB of solid-state drive internal storage which is very less and that&#8217;s the problem with every Chromebook these days. Thankfully, like most others, the Acer Chromebook R11 also comes with an SD card slot to add more storage.<br />

<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with one USB 3.0 port for faster, better, and reliable data transfers and comes with another USB 2.0 port to add on an additional peripheral. The R11 also houses one HDMI Port, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a charging port.</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-image-3315 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible Laptop" width="650" height="398" /><p id="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Chromebook R 11 offers USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card Slot and 3.5mm Audio Jack</strong></em></p></div>
<p>For the connectivity, the Acer Chromebook R11 is packed with the latest MIMO 802.11ac wireless technology to support smooth, reliable, and interruption free internet browsing experience. It comes with Dual-Band support to house both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with ease.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with a 720p HD front-facing webcam. The camera like most of the other laptops doesn’t offer any fancy stuff here. The camera takes images with noise and doesn’t produce accurate colors. However, it will suffice your occasional Skype or Hangout calls. The images captured looks a bit muffled. However, the image adjusts quickly on the frame.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The R11 doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned, on what OS does the device runs on. It runs on the latest Chrome OS, which is powered by Google. Google also promised, regular updates, to keep the device safe and lag-free. Although there isn’t much to say about the OS, we want our viewers to know that almost all the tasks in the Chromebooks are confined in a web UI, i.e in the browser.</p>
<p>It might be exciting to know that, Google also promised that the Chromebooks, will soon be able to run Android applications. However, as of now, the R11 doesn’t run android applications. We expect Google to roll the compatibility in an iterative process in the near future.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are not as powerful as the other Windows OS based counterparts. However, the devices manage to impress with their sturdy performance. Although the devices come with a moderately powerful set of hardware, it’s the light-weight software of the Chrome OS, which makes the things smooth and easy.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the Acer Chromebook R11 comes with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor and a 4GB of RAM. This set of hardware is powerful enough to house most of our daily essentials. To test this, we used the device extensively and here is what we’ve felt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 - Performance" width="480" height="298" /></p>
<p>The R11 handled almost all the basic tasks with ease. Browsing the internet, watching videos, multimedia usage, and editing documents were smooth and lag free. The device takes considerably negligible boot up time and loads very quickly. The device tends to get slightly heated when throttled to its full potential. However, the heat remains in limit and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to use. Being a Chromebook, users need to keep their expectations in check. That said, a Chromebook is far from <a title="Top 8 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a>, and other heavy graphic-demanding applications.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the R11 is neat and sturdy and feels solid to type on. The trackpad is rightly placed and comes with adequate space for the palm rest while using.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Chromebook we expect the device to handle Chrome browser with ease. Since almost all the tasks in the device are performed in a web interface, we rapidly switched between a dozen tabs in Chrome, to which the device responded really well. We also managed to run a couple of benchmarks to get a lucid view of the performance of the device, and here is what we’ve managed to achieve with the R11. It scored an 8,200 in Octane and close to 5000 on Mozilla Kraken. These benchmarks correspond to the ability to run scripts in the browser and overall performance.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 although can be a decent multimedia companion, but the device isn’t any groundbreaking in the segment. Discredits to its dull display and muffled speaker output, you will have to keep your expectations in check.</p>
<p>The device can play almost all formats of video content with ease and we didn’t face any lag or frame drops. The speakers are considerably loud but however, the sound tends to get crackled at higher volumes.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>During our time with the device, the Chromebook R11 lasted slightly over 10 hours on a single charge. The device is backed by a 3220mAh battery and the battery backup of the Chromebook is what makes it a very worthy contender in the segment. The device gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in about 2 hours, and stays juiced up to handle all your essentials.</p>
<p>All that said, Battery backup is undeniably a very strong aspect of the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Touchscreen Laptop" width="450" height="344" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg 450w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-300x229.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Acer Chromebook R11 with impeccable battery life and convertible option makes it a very good buy for the asking price. The touchscreen option, and very neatly recessed keyboard and trackpad make it an easy to use it. However, like with every laptop, it certainly has its own hits and misses. The laptop’s display is dull and the audio output is pretty mediocre.</p>
<p>However, if one is ready to trade off those two aspects with the long-lasting battery backup and stable performance, the Acer Chromebook R11 is certainly a value for money investment. It is also worth considering that most of the other contenders in the price range fall behind the R11 when it comes to performance and versatility that it offers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dell is globally renowned for providing laptops in various segments and it has been doing quite well to attract a huge audience with their offerings. This time, the brand has brought a mid-range 2-in-1 laptop, which comes with a cut-throat pricing for a mainstream convertible laptop.</p>
<p>Our current contender, the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, is an intruding product from the Dell’s Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 notebooks. The entire range of laptops from Dell is now coming with the latest 7th Generation Intel core processors for better performance. Since this laptop is constantly being a global best-seller, we decided to put this laptop to test, and this is what we feel of this affordable 2-in-1 notebook.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design and built quality of the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, the notebook comes with <strong>grey matte finished chassis</strong>. The laptop resembles most of the other laptops in the segment and is recessed inside a plastic chassis. On the top, the laptop comes with a gunmetal grey slab with Dell’s logo recessed in the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2302" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-image-2302 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-13-5000-2-in-1-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378 13 5000 2 in 1 Laptop - Design" width="600" height="404" /><p id="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop (Gun Metal Color)</strong></p></div>
<p>It sports a 13.3-inch display and comes with a <strong>backlit enabled chuckle keyboard</strong>, which is very well designed for all forms of usage. The trackpad is also very well placed and is comfortable to use. On the either sides of the laptop, you have one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a charging slot. Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with dimensions of 325 x 224 x 20.4mm, which makes it a slim offering in the segment. Also, the laptop <strong>weighs just 3.4 pounds</strong>, making it a perfect portable and easy to carry around laptop, which is <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students – Pro Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most suited for college students</a>, business men or anyone who wants powerful and lightweight laptop for their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2303" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-image-2303 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Different-Modes.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Different Modes" width="700" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1. Tent Mode | 2. Stand Mode | 3. Tablet Mode</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, getting deeper into the convertibility and ergonomics of this laptop, it comes with an innovative <strong>360-degree hinge</strong>, which adds on to the versatility and comfort of usage. The laptop allows you to switch easily between four different modes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tent mode</span> is perfect for using recipes in real time, this mode is also perfect for video calling your friends and family while working on something. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand mode</span> of this convertible notebook is meant for movies on the go. The typical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop mode</span> is meant for most of your routine work that you&#8217;d do from your laptops such as <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on word documents</a>, writing emails, and more.  Finally, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tablet mode</span> makes reading easy while you’re leant or reclined.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop sports a <strong>13.3-inch Full HD display</strong>, which comes with a new design emphasised on more screen and less bezel. This not only gives a larger display but also provides a wide-angle display. The display panel on the device is a TrueLife LED-backlit touch display, which provides a brilliant wide-angle view. The laptop’s screen comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving it a sharper image quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-image-2305 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-convertible-display.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 convertible laptop - display" width="800" height="553" /><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>13.3 Inch Full HD Touchscreen Display with 1920 x 1080 Resolution</strong></p></div>
<p>The laptop’s display is not the brightest you get in the segment, and we felt that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was quite dull</span>. The laptop’s sunlight legibility isn&#8217;t the best, and the blacks on the display weren&#8217;t accurate as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre. All in all, the laptop’s display is surely a worth considering drawback of the notebook. However, its touchscreen functionality works absolutely fine in almost all the use cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as aforementioned offers a good set of specifications and hardware for the asking price.</p>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, speaking about the actual innards of this laptop, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with a handsome set of hardware and features. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, the processor can achieve a clock speed of 3.10GHz, which makes it very easy for the device to handle heavy games and apps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i5 Processors (New 2017 Kaby Lake Laptops)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive <strong>1TB of hard disk with 5400RPM</strong>, which is another attractive feature for the price segment it comes under. It also houses Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor to handle all the graphic related content.</p>
<p><em>Like most of the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small convertible laptops</a>, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop also <strong>doesn&#8217;t house a CD/DVD drive</strong> with it.</em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Dell Inspiron i5378 sports a 720p camera, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. Although the images captured using the laptop’s webcam are kind of grainy, the video calls made are serviceable. The colour reproduction is accurate and a camera does manage to capture a lot of details in the images.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the laptop’s <strong>webcam uses infrared technology to bolster facial recognition</strong>. It&#8217;s actually very hard to find facial recognition in laptops at this price range, which is again a very good aspect of the laptop.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Like all other Dell Inspiron 5000 series of laptops, the 2-in-1 i5378 also comes with a good set of ports to support additional peripheral devices and to make the most of a laptop. Speaking of the ports, the laptop houses <strong>one USB 2.0 port</strong> for your regular usage, <strong>two USB 3.0 ports</strong> for enhanced data transfers and added functionalities when you connect any peripherals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY - Ports and Slots" width="519" height="334" />The laptop also houses a full sized <strong>HDMI port</strong> to connect to any display devices. As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Dell Inspiron also houses a <strong>Micro-SD card reader</strong> slot to connect with an SD card. We would have loved the USB Type-C port and we hope that Dell will include it, may be in their next generation 5000 series convertibles?</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY runs <strong>Windows 10 64-bit Home</strong> variant right out-of-the-box. Windows 10 is absolutely the most productive OS in the contemporary world and evidently, doesn&#8217;t need an introduction in the field of laptops. It is not just productive but is also the most common, easy-to-use, reliable, and an OS with the highest number of compatible apps for laptops.</p>
<p>Like all the latest Inspiron laptops, the current laptop also comes with a set of useful apps, readily installed with the laptop. These includes <em>Dell’s SupportAssist</em> app, which is a fairly useful app to provide the right tech support in case of troubleshooting. The <em>Dell Update</em> app makes sure the laptop runs on the latest OS and has all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the other apps which come preloaded with the laptop, there is some <a title="Software bloat - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloatware</a> includes such as DropBox, Royal Revolt 2, Facebook, Netflix, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Twitter, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, and Houzz. Some of them are useful but others can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>laptop comes with a one-year warranty</strong></span>, like most of the other laptops. However, Dell’s after sales support is far better than that of most of the other brands.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to the latest <strong>Kaby Lake (7th Gen)</strong> Intel Core i5-7200U Processor clocked at up to 3.10 GHz, the new Dell Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop runs utterly smooth in almost all the everyday essentials such as handling apps, using for multimedia purposes, gaming, and more. The processor is paired with a good <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which makes the laptop able to handle multitasking with ease. During our review, we tested the laptop with multiple apps running simultaneously, to which the laptop responded really well. Although there was a very minute lag, it was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>For multitasking, we tested the laptop by running benchmarking apps in the background, Google Chrome with up to 15 tabs opened simultaneously, music in the background, and with a constant connectivity to the internet. The laptop was hardly warmed even after 1 hour of such extensive usage session.</p>
<p>During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good <strong>62,482</strong> on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. On Geekbench 4, the laptop scored <strong>6800</strong> which depicts the overall system performance with a stress on graphics reproducibility. These numbers are pretty impressive for a <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops in $500 - $600 Price Range" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop priced just little above $500</a>.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics bolstered by the <strong>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor</strong>. Although the laptop does have a decent set of specifications, it is not meant for extensive and heavy gaming with high graphics and is, therefore, not a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily gaming stationed laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Although the laptop is not meant to handle heavy games such as GTA V, Battlefield, or the DEUS EX in their highest graphics mode, most of the games like the Counterstrike, heroes of the Storm, and Shadowman were still pretty much playable when the graphics set to low/medium.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop can although handle games and graphic-intense apps to an extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s not for the people whose primary concern is gaming</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with <strong>two built-in Stereo speakers</strong>, which are powered by MaxxAudio technology, for better all round sound. The speakers do a great job in providing decent audio output and also doesn&#8217;t turtle at the volume set to maximum. We played high-quality FLAC files on this laptop and the output was just as loud and clear as expected.</p>
<div id="attachment_2308" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-image-2308 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop Review" width="600" height="574" /><p id="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>High resolution display and 2-stereo speakers makes playing games and watching movies fun</strong></p></div>
<p>As far as playing videos, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop can handle HD, Full HD, 2K, and 4K videos without an issue</span> and thanks to the wide-angle screen, watching videos and movies on this 2-in-1 convertible is fun and convincing.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5378 2-in-1 is a powerful laptop with a decent set of specifications including a Full HD display. As for the battery life, the laptop stays juiced up by a 3-cell, 42 Whr battery pack. During our review, the laptop lasted for around <strong>6 hours of continuous usage</strong>. The battery backup is not the greatest considering other similar laptops in the segment delivering 8-10 hours of battery backup. The laptop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">takes about 3 hours to get charged</span> from 0 to 100.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

The laptop does have few pros and cons, but after an extensive review, we personally feel that the laptop has more advantages and benefits than that of its drawbacks. The <strong>dull display can be overlooked</strong> with its convertible feature. Mediocre battery life can be overlooked by its powerful performance.</p>
<p>All in all, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop</span> is definitely a must buy, if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop to flaunt with looks, portability, and performance.</p>
