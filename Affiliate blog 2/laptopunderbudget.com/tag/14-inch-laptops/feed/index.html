										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently published a <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to buy the best 11 inch laptops</a>, where I elaborated the significance of having an ultraportable 11 inch laptop and the best ones you can opt, that are available in the market right now. But what about the other possibilities? What about the users who just can&#8217;t cope with a small&nbsp;display no matter how portable or lightweight the laptop might be? Or for users who want to settle on the middle ground and go for a midrange laptop? For those users here is a complete&nbsp;guide to buy the best 14 inch laptops which will help you to decide, why you should opt for a&nbsp;14 inch laptop over 13 and 15 inch ones and it also includes our&nbsp;10 of the most recommended 14 inch laptops which our team of laptop experts cherry-picked from all&nbsp;available in the market.</p>
<p><span id="more-2331"></span></p>
<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s get started&#8230;</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Why a&nbsp;14 inch laptop is&nbsp;better than 13 and 15 inch laptops?</h3>
<p>It is always beneficial to explore opportunities from every perspective when it comes to investing in a comprehensive laptop&nbsp;for your daily requirements. Be it processing speed, a grade-A display or the perfect size for your taste. The&nbsp;14 inch laptop&nbsp;is considered to be a standard, average sized contrivance. But why you should&nbsp;go with&nbsp;the&nbsp;midsize laptop?</p>
<p>OK, so browsing through the different&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;models, there is a clear distinction between 13, 14 and 15 inch laptops. While ‘just an inch’ may sound insignificant but once you utilize each of them in your daily routine, the size variation would not go <strong>unnoticed</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, consider typing on a 13 inch and a 15 inch laptop. According to several feedbacks from users who have experience in using both, state that they often find keys crammed up a bit in a <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 inch laptops</a>&nbsp;and due to its overall compact size, there is little space to rest your hands during long typing jobs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2334 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Keyboard-of-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="14 Inch Laptop Keyboard Comparison with Keyboard of MacBook Pro 13 Inch Laptop" width="738" height="600">For the 15-inch laptop, the keys are smaller in size, and there&#8217;s also an oddly placed trackpad which provides very less space to rest the left hand. Both of these issues can be problematic if you have big hands. There is also the uneven spacing between keys. Some keys are placed very close to each other while some have more space between them which makes typing a bit uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5270 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Keyboard-of-Dell-Inspiron-5570-15-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="14 Inch Laptop Keyboard Comparison with Keyboard of Dell Inspiron 5000 15 Inch Laptop" width="861" height="607"></p>
<p>A 14 inch laptop falls right in the middle of this dilemma and its&nbsp;industrial design provides neither too much nor too less spacing. Hence,&nbsp;a standard keyboard fits much better in a 14-inch chassis.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Another reason to prefer a 14 inch laptop or bigger over a 13 inch one is that they are known to provide better gaming performances. The smaller the laptop, the smaller will be its hardware bits and essentials, which means a <strong>diminutive battery</strong>, reduced stand up power, and not to mention a tiny keyboard that gets in the way of extreme gaming.</p>
<p>That said, there are hardly any<strong> &#8220;13 inch gaming laptops&#8221;</strong> available to buy in the market right now. The only 13 inch laptop that provided decent specs for gaming was <a title="Alienware 13" href="http://amzn.to/2okpWYe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alienware 13</a>, which is discontinued now, but it was a great laptop with powerful specs and mobility of a small laptop.</p>

<p>On the other hand,&nbsp;there are several 15 and even <strong>14 inch&nbsp;laptops housing dedicated Nvidia GPUs</strong> and are capable of seamlessly hosting several gaming titles in Full HD&nbsp;resolution. Though a 15 inch laptop&nbsp;might be a little too large for some folks to carry and move around, that’s why I’d recommend a 14 inch laptop that perfectly compensates the two contradictory scenarios I mentioned above.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>If you can&#8217;t easily move your computer, why are you buying a laptop in the first place?</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to laptops falling in the mid-size category, they are found to be the most flexible ones we can come around. Large enough to be accommodated at a work desk and small enough to be carried around in a rucksack. 14 inch&nbsp;laptops are considered to be an optimal size for <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students</a>, <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gamers</a> and binge watchers as it has a fairly large screen, enough to provide high-quality streaming and resolution while maintaining its trimness.</p>
</div>

<p>So, now you might be ready to make an informed purchase&nbsp;of the 14 inch laptop for yourself?</p>
<p><em>If yes&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&#8230;here we&nbsp;have sorted a list of best 14-inch laptops available in different price ranges&nbsp;for you to consider and have briefly described their pros and cons that might help you assess which one fits best for your use.</p>
<p>Some of you may be looking for hi-tech processing characteristics, while some of you might base your decision on integrated graphics, so I’ll be roughly covering all aspects. Here are our most recommended best 14-inch compact ultrabooks of&nbsp;2019 to help you buy the best laptop within your budget.</p>

<p>This laptop is for people wanting a cheap, but at the same time, a fancy looking laptop. This economical windows 10 laptop comes with a sharp HD screen, an adequately powerful AMD A4-9120E processor and among its distinctly appreciable pros is the wide selection of I/O ports.</p>
<p>Considering its sleek and elegant chassis, it houses room for an HDMI port, a headset jack, an SD card reader, a USB 2.0 port, and a USB 3.0 port along with fast 802.11a/c Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless connectivity.</p>
<p>As for its processing power, it is a good choice for users who need laptop for casual video browsing and document manipulation. So its affordable rates and lightweight makes it a perfect fit for college students as its small enough to be carried in a backpack. The HP Stream 14 runs on Windows 10 Home in S mode so it can also be a good fit for extreme Windows fanatics, who want the panache of a Chromebook without having to rely on a browser based &#8220;chromebooks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only drawback that can be considered is, its limited 64GB storage and it is slightly heavier than its fellow Chromebook models, but that&#8217;s the case with almost all the&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheap laptops in 200 dollars price range</a>, so to get more storage, either you&#8217;ll have to increase your budget or settle with using the cloud storage or an external hard drive. Other than these, the HP Stream 14 laptop could check a lot of positive aspects on your assessment list including an inexpensive windows laptop, stylish chassis, and a 14 inch HD LED display.</p>

<h3 id="L2">2. ASUS Chromebook C425</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/36t1daz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5776 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-Chromebook-C425-14-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook C425 - best 14 inch chromebook" width="550" height="378"></a></p>
<p>By the looks of it, the Asus Chromebook C425 fits perfectly into the description of a steep, professional, hi-tech and stylish <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2oDmGMO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Air</a>, but instead of draining your bank account, the ASUS Chromebook costs only a few hundred bucks.</p>
<p>The chassis is exceptionally well designed with razor blade edges, rounded corners, an aluminum body and within its metallic frame, there is an Intel Core M3 dual-core processor, a 14 inch full HD IPS touchscreen display and a strong battery that offers a whopping 10-12 hours of backup!</p>
<p>Its processing capabilities, however, may not be considered as one of its strong suits. You might face a bit of lagging and stuttering if you burden its processor with several running web apps or multiple tab operations. However, it&#8217;s still decent for casual users. Moreover, the new Chromebook C425 also gets a microSD card reader which was missing on its predecessor, and it has also got the standard USB 3.1 port and 2 x USB Type-C ports one of which supports charging.</p>
<p>All in all, the laptop&nbsp;offers&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good value for the money</a>, and you won’t be able to get a laptop of this size, design and battery life at a better price. That said, the Asus Chromebook C425 is a nice 14-inch Chromebook for basic work tasks and to sit at your countertop for light browsing and streaming.</p>

<p>With an Acer Aspire 1, you can gladly leave your charger in your drawer and go out for a full workday. Alongside a long-lasting battery, the Acer Aspire 1 comes preinstalled with a Windows 10 OS, and it has a bright full HD 14 inch display, which is a rare-scene at this price point.</p>
<p>The exterior has a classy looking brushed aluminum like finish that makes it appear way more premium than it costs. Another commendable feature is, it comes with long list of ports including HDMI, USB 3.0 and a <strong>Ethernet</strong> port, which is&nbsp;very rare in the <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops falling under sub-$300 category</a>.</p>
<p>For users on a budget, looking for an ultraportable, stylish laptop and are usually on the road, the Acer Aspire 1 is a fair bargain. The 2.6GHz Intel Celeron N4100 processor suffices for basic everyday operations without causing much of a problem. From performance point of view, it offers matchable power to its rivals and clearly outshines among ultraportable, budget laptops. Acer Aspire 1 also hosts an SD card reader to extend its 64GB storage and it comes with 4GB of RAM which is more than enough to help you get through your daily work routine, or light document drafting.</p>
<p>As long as you stick to casual browsing and video streaming, you’d be more than happy with this 14 inch laptop&#8217;s&nbsp;battery life and performance.</p>

<h3 id="L4">4. Lenovo Ideapad S340 14&#8243; Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://lenovo.vzew.net/a95vo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5714 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lenovo-Ideapad-S340-14-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Lenovo Ideapad S340 - best 14 inch laptops" width="550" height="466"></a></p>
<p>The ‘S’ in S340 stands for ’Slim’, and among the Lenovo 300 series, this particular model is the sleekest, most premium designed and it also happens to be the cheapest amidst its peers as well.</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $600" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price tag of around $600</a>, this well-built laptop&nbsp;has been designed by paying peculiar attention to detail, and its ergonomically designed keyboard along with <strong>14-inch slim bezel screen</strong> are perfect examples of it.</p>
<p>With its minimalistic exterior, this slim laptop contains an Intel Core i5-1035G1 processor inside and hosts three USB ports one of which is Type-C, and an SD card reader accompanied by a full-size HDMI output. Although respective to its size, the Ideapad S340 is a bit hefty to carry around and weighs 3.4 pounds and, you might find the touchpad to be not one of the smoothest. However, apart from that, it provides a great battery backup of up to 10 hours and will surely deliver sufficient performance, only if you delegate it to perform regular desktop work, casual browsing, and light gaming.</p>
<p>It can take a little more than lightweight operations, but make sure not to overburden it with arduous tasks as those might require more powerful specs than an 8GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2NfTUvh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5668 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Acer-Swift-3.jpg" alt="Acer Swift 3 - best 14 inch ultrabook" width="550" height="406"></a></p>
<p>After going through the specs of Acer Swift 3&nbsp;judiciously, I think the high-quality hardware that Acer has used to assemble this ultrabook&nbsp;has to be one of its best features. Being entirely responsive, the <strong>aluminum chassis</strong> is so effortlessly decent that it is bound to catch everyone’s attention. Due to its exclusive appearance, it leaves the impression that it is a steeply priced high end laptop. So if you want to look fancy on a low budget&nbsp;then the Acer Swift 3 might be your go-to choice for best 14 inch laptop.</p>
<p>From the point of view of operational capabilities, the Acer Swift 3 ultrabook is robust enough to be equipped with everyday applications, without compromising its overall performance. Another attractive aspect is the <strong>Whiskey Lake (8th generation)</strong> Intel Core i7-8565U processor, which supports routine tasks and multiple tab operations without any struggle and can also diligently handle gaming, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo editing on&nbsp;Adobe Photoshop</a>&nbsp;or <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light video editing on&nbsp;Adobe Premiere</a>, all due credit to its dedicated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce MX150 dedicated graphics processor</span>. Moreover it comes with sufficient amount of RAM, 8 GB to be exact and a 256GB SSD for storage.</p>
<p>One of the very few drawbacks of this laptop would be a 3220 mAh battery, that could have been replaced with a larger one, but it’s not too bad either. Another one would be a slightly dim screen that makes it a bit difficult to be used outdoors. But other than that, the Acer Swift 3 is one of the <strong>best 14 inch ultrabook</strong>&nbsp;with latest and greatest specs for users with everyday needs on a low budget.</p>

<h3 id="L6">6. Lenovo Yoga C940 14-Inch Convertible Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://lenovo.vzew.net/RXDna" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5778 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-Yoga-C940-14-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga C940 Best 14 Inch Convertible Laptop" width="550" height="434"></a></p>
<p>Who doesn’t want the comfort of using a premium convertible laptop with minimalistic looks and top-notch features. But the entire package sound too good to be real, at least with a reasonable rate. The Lenovo Yoga C940, offers it all and causing only a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">damage of about $1000</a>, the metallic edges and beautiful screen gives off a lavish appearance and apparently comes without a backbone.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Yoga C940 offers great value for money. A <strong>10th gen Intel Core i5-1035G4 processor</strong>, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is more than enough for an average user to get through his day. The 14 inch wide Full HD display with <strong>wide viewing angles</strong> can definitely be paraded around like a trophy, mainly because of the sharp screen quality and vibrant display of colors. Moreover, it comes with Lenovo Active Pen and what&#8217;s unique though is its hinge which holds the soundbar to project three dimensional audio, and it rotates with the screen to fire sound always in the right direction.</p>
<p>From performance perspectives, this 14 inch laptop was found to be more than adequate and can perform multi-tasking operations and video streaming side by side without any noticeable lag. Still, if you want more power then you can configure the Lenovo Yoga C940 with 14-inch UHD display, up to 16GB of RAM and massive 2TB of SSD.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of Lenovo Yoga C940 are a not so standard webcam and a keyboard with less traveling keys. But these limitations are certainly not critical enough to make us overlook the wide range of eminent features it brings to the table.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Flex 14 is another excellent convertible laptop which offers similar specs and features as the above-mentioned Yoga C940, but for a lot less. It comes with the quad-core i5 processor paired with 16GB RAM and 256GB of SSD which delivers optimum performance for everyday productivity and casual gaming. Moreover, it also has the 14-inch full HD IPS touchscreen panel which supports Pen input. However, the materials used to build the Flex 14 aren&#8217;t as premium as the Yoga C940, and that&#8217;s to match its price tag. Its chassis is made up of polycarbonate material and has sturdy metallic hinges to convert this laptop into different modes with confidence. The build quality, however, is still superior than most other plastic built laptops. So, overall Lenovo Flex 14 is also a great 14-inch convertible laptop for the people who don&#8217;t want to spend much and still don&#8217;t want to miss out on any features of the costly Yoga C940. | <a title="Best Price on Lenovo" href="https://lenovo.vzew.net/M1Y93" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$899.99 from Lenovo</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another ultraportable, convertible laptop in the list which is from a well-renowned laptop manufacturing brand Dell. The Inspiron 5482 is a recently launched 14-inch 2-in-1 laptop which is good enough to land on our top picks of best 14 inch laptops list anywhere, anytime. With a complete <span style="text-decoration: underline;">360 degrees wrap around hinge</span>, the Inspiron 5482 comprises of all the essential features, that are, to be honest not so flattering but good enough to pull through everyday tasks.</p>
<p>How you analyze its performance depends entirely upon your usage and prioritization of specifications. A fair warning, if you are a frequent traveler, this laptop might cause you a bit of inconvenience with its <em>slightly bulky body</em>. That said, the laptop weighs 3.9 pounds which is more than other convertibles in its category. Although you can consider its <strong>tough build quality</strong>&nbsp;a compensatory aspect for the thick weightage. But, the keyboard on this laptop is&nbsp;definitely the star of the show as it sports a backlit keyboard with well-spaced keys.</p>
<p>As far as performance is concerned, the laptop provides ample power to get through all requirements of the average user. It is an <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel Core i5 powered laptop</a> with an impressive 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.

<p>It appears Lenovo is taking their budget line damn seriously, this being the third addition in this list from their brand. That said, the Lenovo ThinkPad T490 is a more affordable alternative to its lightweight and more premium sibling <a title="Check Price on Lenovo" href="https://Lenovo.vzew.net/Pv2Kq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lenovo&nbsp;ThinkPad X1 Carbon</a>. The ThinkPad T490 has of-course a 14 inch display and it is powered by a current gen Intel core i5 processor paired with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>These configurations when put together are adequate enough to support multi-tab operations and running basic office applications without taking any hiccups. So it is fair to say that Lenovo Thinkpad T490 would be best 14 inch laptop for corporate usage, which requires mainly <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for QuickBooks – Our Most Recommended Business Laptops for Accounting" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-quickbooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts management</a>, documentation and other workplace impositions. With strong hardware specs and a decent looks, it is a perfect blend of class, and robust underlying features.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with the Intel UHD 620 graphics this laptop is not at all recommended for hardcore gamers. It can support some original classics without causing any noticeable trouble, but for more up-to-date titles, ThinkPad T490 is a big NO for gaming. Moreover, the display is somewhat lacking and is not a good choice for outdoor usage, especially during bright sunny days. So overall verdict, a perfect office contraption and would do great sitting on your desk.</p>

<p>The <strong>Lenovo ThinkBook 14s</strong> is also a great option if you are looking for a budget business ultrabook. It doesn&#8217;t come with the legendary ThinkPad keyboard, nor it has that rugged business-grade ThinkPad build quality, but it&#8217;s still an all-aluminum built laptop which manages to look premium.

<p>ASUS VivoBook S14 may look like an ordinary laptop from its design, but it is a power packed performer which can handle almost everything you throw at it including gaming. The laptop&#8217;s design is minimalistic with a brushed aluminum lid, and polycarbonate chassis finished in golden color. However, its innards are inversely powerful to handle the requirements of hard-core users. The laptop is powered by an Intel Core i7 quad-core processor with 8GB of RAM and speedy 256GB of SSD. What&#8217;s unique though is it also comes with a dedicated Nvidia GPU which makes this laptop capable enough to handle some of the newest gaming titles.</p>
<p>The display on the ASUS VivoBook S14 is of-course a 14-inch panel and it produces vibrant colors and has wide viewing angles. However, it&#8217;s a bit dim which makes it hard to use this laptop in direct sunlight, but for working indoors, it is perfect. The keyboard on this laptop is another excellent aspect of this laptop. Its keys are backlit, and they are well laid out to get used to with it easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, it also features fingerprint scanner for easy one-touch unlocks and its battery life is also very good which can last up to 8 hours on a single charge. The only let down, the device heats&nbsp;up after only a couple of hours of gaming, but hey what did you expect from a ‘portable’ ‘gaming laptop’. These two terms hardly belong together in a sentence.</p>

<p>While there are no good 14-inch gaming laptops currently, the Razer Blade 15 is the laptop that can still be considered when looking for the best ultraportable gaming laptops. It holds the crown of World&#8217;s Smallest Gaming Laptop right now and although it technically has a 15-inch display, its chassis is still smaller than most of the 14-inch laptops on this list. So, we had to give it a place here.</p>
<p>With a killer slim profile, the Razer Blade 15 boasts a six-core Intel 8th-generation core i7 processor with 16GB of RAM and a speedy 512GB SSD. But its award winning aspects are definitely the VR ready <strong>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 GPU</strong> paired with a smooth <span style="text-decoration: underline;">15.6&#8243; Full HD 144Hz display</span> that gives you a crystal clear illusion of reality.</p>
<p>A <em>feather light chassis with powerful gaming qualities</em> are just too good to be true. Its hardware bits are robust enough to pull through heavy tasks, side-by-side with some quality gaming without leaving any traces of lagging. But all of this does not come cheap and will cause you a damage of $2000 approx so if you can pay the premium then this is the best portable mid-size gaming laptop right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have seen massive diversity in almost all gadgets and devices unveiled at CES 2019. But the trend that most widely dominated all, was slim bezels. Now, Lenovo jumped into the &#8216;bezel-less&#8217; bandwagon back in 2016 with their Yoga 910 but failed to live up to that title due to the large chin of the laptop which spoiled the entire look. That is not the case this time with Lenovo&#8217;s latest creation the Yoga S940.</p>
<div id="attachment_5180" style="width: 539px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5180" class="size-full wp-image-5180" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-CES-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 Announced at CES 2019" width="529" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5180" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>This time in CES 2019, just having a weightless form factor and a wide screen wouldn&#8217;t do a new ultrabook any favors. As every second laptop displayed at the event contains just that. Gladly, Lenovo found a way around that dilemma and equipped this laptop with Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>The aspect that Yoga S940 focuses most on is user privacy. The Glance by Mirametrix attention-sensing AI is able to detect user presence and turning the screen on or off based on their engagement. It also keeps away nosy nellies by detecting an unwanted set of eyes on the screen of peepers. There is also a built-in eye tracking system that senses your focus and eye movement, switching the content based on its judgment.</p>
<p>Another beautiful feature is screen quality of the Yoga S940. It boasts a 13.9-inch panel with either 4K HDR400 support and 500-nit brightness or a 1080p display that comes with Dolby Vision and 400-nit brightness. The almost edge to edge screen &#8211; thanks to some seriously thin bezels, is accompanied with a curved glass that melts into the lid.</p>
<div id="attachment_5182" style="width: 819px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5182" class="size-full wp-image-5182" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lenovo-Yoga-S940-contour-glass.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga S940 contour glass" width="809" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5182" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Lenovo</p></div>
<p>There are also touch-less sign-in methods enabled by the infrared (IR) camera that uses Windows Hello via facial recognition and iris scanning. And if you prefer voice login, there is also the Smart Voice technology with both Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga S940 is using 8th Gen Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. Connectivity options include two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and one USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port. So there goes the regular USB-A port which was quite expected due to the change of culture towards USB-C.</p>
<p>Lenovo will start rolling out the Yoga S940 from May 2019 pricing from $1,500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After CES 2019, it seems like slim notebooks with razor-thin bezels are the new trendsetters in the laptop market. Just like <a title="ASUS has just added a notebook with the ‘world’s slimmest bezels’ to its ZenBook line" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASUS ZenBooks</a>, Acer has also taken it upon themselves to add new, upgraded and slim bezeled notebooks to their already successful lineups.</p>
<p>Their renewed version of the Acer Swift 7 &#8211; already lauded for its slim build and portability, was unveiled at CES 2019. The new model known as the SF714-52T, takes off almost a third of a pound off of the previous Swift 7’s package. Due to its narrow frame, the bezels have shrunk to an unbelievable extent creating a wider, more engaging display. More on the design side, Acer claims the laptop&#8217;s body weight to be just 890 grams and just 9.9mm in thickness. And ofcourse, there is a 14-inch full HD touch Cornilla glass display with a fully immersive experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">With just 92 percent screen-to-body ratio, the latest Acer Swift 7 features an 8th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, 256GB or 512GB SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM. </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Acer promises a boost in the performance as well, highlighting their addition of the “Amber Lake” Intel Core processor. Acer prides their new invention for its compactness and the fact that the size does not arbitrate its productivity. A clear precedent is the inclusion of two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, and 3.5mm headphone jack all on its trim body. And even then, the device is so lightweight that it feels &#8216;barely there&#8217;. Moreover, Acer has promised the optimal performance with all-day battery life, lasting up to 10 hours on a single charge.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5018 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/acerswift72019.jpg" alt="Acer's Refreshed Swift 7 - CES 2019" width="580" height="358" /></p>
<p>But the upgrade that Swift users had desperately been waiting for is yet to be told. That&#8217;s right, the clickable touchpad. It was annoying and frustrating to use the tap to click method which gladly has now been eliminated thanks to this addition.</p>
<p>Now the only concern with slim bezels is the placement of webcams. That&#8217;s where the creativity really unfolds and shows how much thought designers have put into it. Not only did Acer add an HDR camera but also incorporated a push to open mechanism. Which not only is the best solution but also prevents unintended webcam usage which is a huge privacy invasion these days.</p>
<p>All these niceties are beautifully wrapped up inside what Acer calls a “micro-arc oxidation finish”. This gives the machine a ceramic-like look, available either in “Starfield Black” or “Moonstone White” themes.</p>
<p>While the upgraded version of the Acer Swift 7 is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor, it is delightful and also surprising to see that the upgrades have little impact on the costing. The new 2019 Swift 7 SF714-52T is to be priced around $1,699 which is almost the same as its previous version and will be available by May in the US.</p>

<p>Here we are going to have an in-depth look at the Acer Aspire 1 (A114-32-C1YA). I will be going through different aspects of the device, talking about the pros and cons as well as the things that I personally liked or disliked during my time with this laptop.</p>

<p>As you can see in the specs, the Acer Aspire 1 is powered by the Intel Celeron N4000 dual-core processor, which is based on Gemini Lake. The CPU has a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz and can boost to 2.6 GHz. The chip also comes with 4 MB of L2 cache. This is the same CPU that you get in the HP Stream 14. Other than that, you get 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>With that said, let&#8217;s begin with our review of Acer Aspire 1, talking about each aspect of the laptop, one by one.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 is an entry-level laptop from Acer, so there isn&#8217;t really anything fancy about the design but it is still a robust machine, and overall it is very clean. The exterior of the laptop looks stylish, especially the brushed aluminum finish on the lid with silver Acer logo in the center. On opening the lid, you&#8217;ll find the same finish around the keyboard and touchpad area as well. While there is nothing to brag about the design of this laptop, it manages not to look cheap.</p>
<div id="attachment_4885" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-image-4885 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Textured-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Textured Lid" width="700" height="525" /><p id="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Brushed Aluminum Finish on the Lid</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, there are certain design flaws on this laptop, and one of them is its bad speaker placement. The laptop has two speakers at the bottom, one on either side, and its poor placement muffled the sound everytime I used the laptop from my lap. If we talk about the sound quality, then it isn&#8217;t that great either. Its two speakers do get loud enough to fill the small-sized room, but I felt a lack of clarity while listening to music. But, considering that this is a $200 laptop, some sacrifice needed to be made, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Talking about the internal design, getting to the internals of this laptop was very hard. I had to open fifteen screws and had to pull the back panel off to gain access to the parts, but that&#8217;s fine because there are no upgradable parts inside the laptop. The RAM and storage drive is soldered on the motherboard, and that makes users stuck with its low 4GB of RAM which kind of bottlenecks its overall performance (more on this later). Moreover, the internal design is fanless so you won&#8217;t be hearing any fan noise when you use the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_4886" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-image-4886 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Internal-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Internal Design" width="667" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Internal Design | RAM Soldered on Motherboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall the Acer Aspire 1 has decent build quality. The materials used do not feel like this is an entry-level device. The texture on the lid adds to the premiums of the laptop, and the laptop not only looks impressive but feels great as well. The device is pretty light, and you can easily take it with you.</p>

<h4>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h4>
<p>There are a couple of useful ports on this laptop that make it great for the price. You get an ethernet port that will allow you to plug in an ethernet cable if you want faster internet speeds and do not want to rely on a wireless connection. You also have an HDMI output port that will deliver 4K at 30 FPS. On the left, you have a USB 3.0 port to transfer data faster. You also get an SD card slot, but the card sticks out which can be an issue if you were looking to expand laptop&#8217;s limited storage with the SD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4887" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Left-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Left Side Ports" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you have the combo jack for headphones and two more USB 2.0 ports. These are slower ports that can be used to connect a mouse or other devices that do not require higher throughput.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Right-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="382" /></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you will be able to take advantage of high-speed internet and routers that use 5 GHz frequencies. The laptop also offers Bluetooth 4.1 which can be used to connect wireless devices like a mouse or a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display on the Aspire 1 is a 14-inch TN panel which does not offer great viewing angles, and as expected it isn&#8217;t color accurate either. The bright side is that while the screen is the same size as the HP Stream 14, it has a higher resolution. That said, the Acer Aspire 1 is the only laptop in this price segment to offer full HD display making it the perfect budget option for binge watchers.</p>
<div id="attachment_4890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-image-4890 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 - Display Review" width="800" height="637" /><p id="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>14-inch Full HD Matte Display</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The screen is a bit dim, but it has a matte coating on top which does a great job of reducing reflections while using this laptop in well-lit areas. Overall, it is a pretty decent panel keeping in mind that this laptop costs just a little <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200</a>.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature is that the screen can be rotated more than 180 degrees. The Acer Aspire 1 is in no means a 2-in-1 device, so I do not really know what Acer is trying to do with this feature, but you can have the screen flat on a surface if you want. The hinge does have a bit of range, and that might keep the screen from snapping off.</p>

<h3>Keyboard And Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard on the Acer Aspire 1 is very impressive, the keys have ample travel, and they are decent to type on. The keys are also a bit larger than usual which is great for typing. The only issue is that the placement of some keys can take a bit of getting used to. You will need to adjust to the arrangement of the small arrow keys and the buttons next to the Enter and Backspace keys. This is not a major issue, and once you have used the device for a few hours, you should get used to it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Review-Keyboard-and-Touchpad.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="750" height="590" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is much better than some previous <a title="All Acer Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> that we have used in the past, and the overall design is decent. The touchpad is not all that great though. It is a bit wobbly, but it will get the job done. It uses Windows Precision drivers and supports gestures as well. Compared to the HP Stream 14, the keyboard is fine, but the touchpad could have been better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks of Laptops for Writers with Comfortable Keyboards</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The webcam on the Aspire 1 is another thing after speakers that Acer has compromised to price it competitively. Acer has fitted a very bad webcam on this laptop which produces an unacceptable picture and video quality, even as per the budget laptop standards. The picture that I took of mine with its webcam came out entirely out of focus, grainy and with vanished colors.</p>
<p>So, if you have to make a lot of video calls everyday or attend the video conferences, then this is not the right laptop for you unless you are ready to spend a bit extra for an <a title="External Webcams on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LH16yf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">external webcam</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode which is excellent for students and individuals who need added security. For uninitiated, the S mode limits the third party apps that you can download, and you can only use apps that are verified by Microsoft and are available on the official Microsoft store. Well, if you don&#8217;t like it, opting out of the S mode is not an issue, and you can move to regular Windows 10 Home with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Software-and-Warranty-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Software and Warranty Review" width="735" height="550" /></p>
<p>Along with Window 10, there are a couple of other apps and games as well that come pre-installed. These include the Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Friends Saga, Cooking Fever, Township, Royal Revolt 2, Fitbit Coach, Photastic Collage, ACG player and Amazon. All these apps can be uninstalled, so it&#8217;s not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The laptop also comes with a free year of Office 365 and the Acer Product registration app which you will need to register your device, check the warranty and get customer support.<br />

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 is a netbook with the dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM, so I did not have high hopes when testing the device and it seems that I was right for the most part. The 4 GB of RAM is a major limitation, and it took only four Chrome tabs to get the device to slow down. With eight tabs open in Chrome and one of them playing a YouTube video, there was a noticeable lag when typing.</p>
<p>While this is not a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming machine</a>, we did play Asphalt 9 on the device, and it ran well. There was no noticeable lag, but then again, the game is very well optimized and will even run on smartphones. We also tried Cooking Fever that came pre-installed, and that ran fine as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Real-Life-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Real Life Performance" width="527" height="700" /></p>
<p>As far as thermals are concerned, the device’s bottom does get a bit warm even while normal multi-tasking possibly because of its fanless design. It can be problematic for users like me who like to use the laptop by keeping it on the lap. However, it was completely usable when kept on the table, and its keyboard and palm rest area didn’t show any signs of heat which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Acer Aspire 1 isn&#8217;t great when it comes to multitasking and although it will run games found on the official store just fine, you cannot expect to play games on it. Opening multiple apps or even Chrome tabs will slow it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>Recommended: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The claimed battery life of the 2018 Acer Aspire 1 is around 6.5 hours, and in our tests, it managed to last for 7 hours and 12 minutes which is decent, but there are options in the market that will give you 8-9 hours of battery backup. That is a factor worth considering if you are someone who has to rely a lot on battery power every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laptop took 2 hours and 17 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% which is also a little longer than the other laptops. So, the battery on the Acer Aspire 1 takes its time to charge and does not offer much in terms of battery life either.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Under $200 &#8211; Our Most Recommended Inexpensive Laptops</a></strong></em> </div></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Laptop-Review-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Laptop Review - Featured Image" width="650" height="483" /></p>
<p>One of the strongest points of the Acer Aspire 1 is its 14-inch full HD display which makes hard to find a substitute for this laptop. Moreover, it offers plenty of ports and comes with modern wireless connectivity options so that you can take advantage of high-speed internet and connect your wireless devices. Although its speakers lack in clarity and have an awful webcam, one cannot go wrong with it considering it costs just $250.</p>
<p>So, overall the Acer Aspire 1 is a solid laptop for the price if you consume content online or work with documents. It can handle some mobile games that are available on the Microsoft store and is a well-built machine overall. The storage and RAM are the limiting factors, but if all you need is a device on which you can create documents, browse the web and watch movies, then this is one of the best inexpensive laptops right now that will get the job done.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3971 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="955" height="143" /></p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has been beating around the bush in the laptop’s arena for quite some time now. The company is globally renowned to provide value for money, powerful laptops to suit various needs. Although the company has a decent market share and value in selling their top of the line high-end laptops, it was still lagging in meeting the demands of a powerful budget-friendly device.</p>
<p>Considering the growing global demands for budget-friendly compact notebooks, Acer has partnered with Microsoft and introduced the Acer Aspire 1, which is one of the most inexpensive Windows 10 based laptop in the market. During our inculcating time with this high-on-features yet, low-on-budget notebook, we managed to gather a lot of information which will undeniably, answer all your queries about the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop. Without bragging more about the laptop. Let’s quickly dive into the review.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes in a polycarbonate chassis and is cladded in a charcoal-grey exterior. The laptop comes with a brushed metal finish, which adds to the premium factor for the laptop. It is thin, compact, portable, and comes with a beautiful tactile finish. Thanks to its texture and form-factor, the laptop offers good grip to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3052 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-14-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14 Inch Laptop - Design" width="650" height="324" /></p>
<p>The laptop weighs just around 3.6 pounds and measures 13.5 x 9.65 x 0.71 inches, which is now a standard for these <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inchers</a>. The screen is surrounded by thick bezels in a matte-black bezel, and rubber cladding covering all sides. All the ports and connectors are neatly recessed at either side of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop features a 180-degree hinge, so the keyboard and screen can lay flat together. This feature makes it an ideal choice for a group of kids to huddle around a desk and allows the users to adjust the screen to whatever level, they are most comfortable with.</p>

<p>On a conclusive note about the design and finish of the Aspire 1, although the laptop doesn’t offer a lot of fancy flairs, it certainly ticks all the design essentials including built quality, finish, grip, and portability.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 14-inch Full HD display, which is a rare scene for a <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $300</a>. It comes with a widescreen display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Considering the specifications, the laptop is unarguably a great bargain for the price. Now let’s speak about its real-time performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3054 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Full-HD-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Full HD Display" width="800" height="596" /></p>
<p>The device comes with a very crisp and sharp display panel, which offers adequate colors with precision. During our review, we extensively used the laptop to watch high definition content and 4K content. When I viewed the aforementioned content, I noticed that although the blacks on the screen were slightly dull and less punchy, it was able to reproduce good color gamut, which we hardly see in a laptop at this price.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Although the design is one of the strong points of the Acer Aspire 1, the hardware and specifications are yet another unique selling point of this laptop. It sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-Core Processor which can throttle up to 2.2GHz. The processor is paired with a 4GB of RAM to handle multitasking and applications on the device. The device comes with a mere 32GB of onboard storage, which <strong>cannot</strong> be, however, further expanded by putting a bigger SSD or HDD.</p>
<p>Graphics on the laptop are handled by the CPU&#8217;s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU, which although isn’t meant to handle high-end games, can still take on moderate graphics with ease. Other specifications of the device include connectivity options such as 802.11ac WiFi featuring MIMO technology. It also sports a dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz to boost up the connectivity speeds.</p>
<p>Considering the price point at which the laptop is being sold, trading-off with some hardware feels absolutely fine. As long as your expectations are in check, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop will not disappoint you.<br />

<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop comes with a VGA front facing webcam, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. The maximum resolution of the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 is 640&#215;480  pixels. The images captured on the camera felt slightly underwhelming and turned out grainy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2875 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Acer-Aspire-1-14-inch-full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14-inch full HD Laptop" width="550" height="312" /></p>
<p>The video calls on the laptop were serviceable. On a conclusive note, the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 doesn’t come with anything worth mentioning but it certainly does the basics well.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 offers a long list of connectivity options and ports. All the ports and connectivity slots on this laptop are equally distributed on its either sides. Accordingly, it sports 1 USB 3.0 Port, a HDMI port with HDCP support, and an SD card reader on its left edge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3056 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Ports and Slots" width="1000" height="307" /></p>
<p>Whereas the right corner of the laptop contains 2 USB 2.0 ports and a 3.5mm Audio Jack.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer preloads the Aspire 1 with the Windows 10 Home variant and with just a handful of utilities that makes the laptop free from unnecessary bloatware. The laptop also comes with some of the Acer’s proprietary software and tools including the Acer Care Center, which monitors the system health and provides the information about the software updates.</p>
<p>Like in most of the latest Acer laptops, The Aspire 1’s Power Button comes with a customisable option to perform multiple options. And all these options can be customised and easily set through the Windows 10 control panel. Speaking about the Acer Quick Access, the software allows you to quickly enable or disable the blue light-reduction mode and aids in setting up a quick hotspot.</p>
<p>Apart from them, the laptop comes with a standard load of casual games, tools, and trialware. On a conclusive note, the laptop does offer a sturdy and well-rounded software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Top 10 Best Laptops Under $200</strong></em></a></div></div>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 as mentioned above comes with a decent set of specifications. However, specifications alone cannot predict the regular daily usage. The laptop takes about 10-12 seconds to boot the Windows 10, which is rather slow. All the apps take a while to load and heavy applications such as the Chrome might take another 5-10 seconds to show up. Thankfully, the RAM management on the device seems to work just fine and multi-tasking was good and smooth.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, we pushed it to its complete throttle and threw a hard set of applications and requests simultaneously. The laptop to our surprise did pretty well, and was able to handle most of the tasks well.</p>
<p>As far as the benchmarks are concerned, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop performs well in numbers considering the specifications. We managed to get a handsome 2044 and 2100 points in PCMark 8, which are very commendable considering the processor. While the number always doesn’t reflect the performance, all we can say is, we were pretty satisfied with the overall performance of the Aspire 1.</p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming capabilities of this budget-friendly notebook, it is provided with the Intel’s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU. Do note that, the laptop doesn’t come with any other additional graphics processor and is, therefore, not an ideal machine, if you&#8217;re looking for a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming-stationed laptop</a>. Although it is capable of rendering decent graphics and pictures in the videos and lighter games, it simply cannot run high-end games.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a pair of built-in stereo speakers, which are neither weak nor are groundbreaking. That said, the speakers are powerful enough to pump up an audio experience in a small room. The speakers are capable of providing clear and distortion free audio output.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3057" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Speakers-and-Audio-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Speakers and Audio Quality" width="700" height="392" /></p>
<p>We played some HD, Full HD, and 4K content on this laptop, to which it responded well. Thanks to its full HD display, the colors were well reproduced and we had a good time using the laptop as a source of entertainment and multimedia.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 2-cell Li-Ion Battery of 4810 mAh. The laptop being provided with the right set of hardware and features, it provides a very impressive battery backup of up to 9 hours of continuous usage.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, it did provide exceptionally good backup and was able to provide a screen on time of over 8 hours on one full charge. The laptop gets fully charged in just under 2 hours 30 minutes, which we feel is pretty ideal. It is worth noting that, the laptop doesn’t get warm even while charging and using it simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3049" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/acer-aspire-1-a114-31-c4hh-laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop" width="500" height="310" /></p>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 is a mixed bag. That said, there are aspects which makes it tough to believe that it’s a laptop priced at around $200. While, on the other hand, few aspects of the laptop really disappoints, especially, the non-expendable internal storage. Considering every aspect of the laptop, it is quite evident by now that the Acer Aspire 1 is a very affordable and an excellent value for money notebook. For those, who are tight on budget, but wants to stay productive through the versatility of a laptop, then it’s undeniable that there is no better substitute for the Acer Aspire 1, in its segment.</p>
