										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when Samsung unveiled their Chromebook Plus V2 in June earlier this year? While the device was applauded for its affordability, it just couldn&#8217;t live up to the original Chromebook Plus. Well at least according to some users. Maybe Samsung paralleled with this idea and decided to up their Chromebook Plus V2 game up a bit. Turns out that Samsung, in collaboration with Google, has upgraded this Chromebook model to support 4G LTE.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The Chromebook Plus V2 stepped into the shelves with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, Intel Celeron 3965Y processor chip &#8211; faster than the <a title="Samsung Chromebook Plus Review – Play Store finally comes to Chromebooks" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/samsung-chromebook-plus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Plus</a>, a  12.2-inch, 1080p display, 4GB RAM, 32GB of solid-state storage, and a 39Wh battery. So you can see that Chromebook Plus V2 was intended to be the upgraded version of the Chromebook Plus. More so, this device is capable enough to be called premium.</span></p>
<p>Samsung deciding to upgrade their already upgraded version seems like they wanted an edge over the <a title="Google Pixel Slate is finally here and here’s our take on the tablet!" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/google-pixel-slate-features-specs-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Pixel Slate</a>. Which according to tech reviewers is the biggest contender of the Chromebook Plus V2 this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_4323" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-image-4323 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-V2-with-LTE.jpg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE" width="561" height="369" /><p id="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-caption-text">Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE</p></div>
<p>Josh Newman, general manager of Mobile PC Segments, Intel Client Computing Group, said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Samsung’s new Chromebook Plus V2 (LTE) device meets this expectation with style by fusing Samsung design ingenuity and Google’s beloved OS with Intel processors and Intel LTE connectivity.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>What does the 4G LTE do?</h3>
<p>For all you folks who don&#8217;t really grasp the idea of 4G LTE, let me break it down for you. It allows you to stay connected to the internet even if you don&#8217;t have a Wi-Fi connection. The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE or the Chromebook Plus V2 on-the-go is a dream for remote workers and travelers.</p>
<p>A sharp HD display with 300 nits max brightness, an energy-efficient processor, 360-degree hinge, and a stylus with an added 4G LTE feature sound too good to be true. It&#8217;s not all fun and games though. The connectivity feature addition adds a $100 cost to the overall price too. Not quite affordable but wouldn&#8217;t be called too steep either.</p>
<p>The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE be available for $599 when it launches on November 2 at Verizon and Best Buy. Samsung hasn&#8217;t yet revealed which networks this device will supporting but we have good hopes.</p>
<p>Given that the Google Pixel comes with the same price as this 2-in-1 convertible notebook but minus the 4G LTE feature, might not work in Pixel&#8217;s favor. Or maybe the Google Pixel Slate&#8217;s innovative design and sleeker body be enough for Chrome OS lovers to choose it over LTE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like 2018 is going to leave us with a wave of premium laptop ranges. The stylish<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/"> Surface Pro 6</a> and the leather-wrapped <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/">Spectre Folio </a>and even the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/alienware-m15-first-thin-light-gaming-laptop/">Alienwares </a>were up to take the challenge this time in building the thinnest all-rounder PC ever.</p>
<p>Well, the year still hasn&#8217;t ended and there&#8217;s more to come. Turns out that HP has come up with a sleek design for their Chromebooks as well. Just yesterday, HP has released a trendy upgrade of their Chromebook x2; the Chromebook x360 14.</p>
<h3>Features and Specifications</h3>
<p>I have to say that the by looking at the specifications and architecture of the machine, it is directed towards more advanced users. While lacking the accessibility of a detachable keyboard like its sibling Chromebook x2, the Chromebook x360 14 packs the powerful 8th Gen Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. Not to mention the Advanced Electrodeposition (AED) body to give the chassis a matte ceramic finish along with durability and beauty. The &#8217;14&#8217; apparently denotes the 14-inch display which is a 16:9 1920×1080 IPS panel with pretty slim bezels. Complimenting the laptop&#8217;s overall appearance.</p>
<p>The keyboard &#8211; although not detachable, is fully backlit and the battery can last up to 13.5 hours of on a single charge. The device fashions two USB-C ports and a couple of USB-A ports too. The microSD slot and a headphone jack on the side, it also comes with an “HD Wide Vision” webcam.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Chromebook x360 14 hosts an <span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">8GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM with a </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">64GB eMMC storage. But it&#8217;s still a question whether these more than impressive specs be able to cover up the hole left by the absence of a pen in this device.</span></p>
<p>Another stance that HP is trying to make with the Chromebook x360 14 is that it&#8217;s a luxury device. Comparatively to the Chromebook x360 11 that was aimed more towards students.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4264" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HP-x360-14-Chromebook.jpg" alt="HP x360 14 Chromebook" width="600" height="419" /></p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>The Chromebook x360 15 is up for pre-orders now on HP&#8217;s <a href="http://tidd.ly/b3b1cd15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> and will be available in stores from October 21.</p>
<p>The device will cost you a total damage of $600. Seems like a fair price for a device that sits amongst the Elite notebooks in terms of specs, looks, and durability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only a week left before the &#8216;Made by Google&#8217; event which is the grand launch of Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones. Nonetheless, techies are also psyched about the unveiling of Pixel Slate and more so because it is rumoured to dual boot Windows 10.</p>
<h3>But why do we think so?</h3>
<p>It was revealed in the Chromium documentation that surfaced sometime in July, a <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/1155570">commit</a> that mentions &#8216;<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/upcoming-chromebook-nocturne-named-pixel-slate/">Nocturne</a>&#8216; a.k.a Pixel Slate along with Windows 10.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Windows 10 will BSOD early during boot with the way things are currently laid out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This might just mean that Windows 10 might appear in a future <a title="Chromebook Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/chromebooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook</a> model. But with the upcoming Google event and the rumors about Pixel Slate, it only makes so much sense that these two might come in a package.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/bmpblk/+/1236014">Chromium code commit</a> suggests renaming &#8216;alt-os&#8217; to &#8216;dual boot&#8217;. This seems like good enough evidence to raise speculations about a dual boot OS related to this project.</p>
<blockquote><p>Add select_os, rename &#8216;alt os&#8217; to &#8216;dual boot&#8217;.</p>
<p>Add campfire specific image resources</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Alt-OS&#8217; a.k.a &#8216;Project Campfire&#8217; believed as Google&#8217;s project for incorporating dual-booting option and Chrome OS in a single device.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, another <a href="https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/27605/1..3//COMMIT_MSG">commit</a> resurfaced stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve got an OS that can&#8217;t boot with the way things are currently laid out</p></blockquote>
<p>With these slight hints, I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that Google has been planning this for a while and what better device to inaugurate this feature in than their very own hybrid, Pixel Slate.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; letter-spacing: -1px;">Final Verdict for Pixel Slate</span></p>
<p>Uptil now, only the Pixel Book has officially been declared to have support for both Google OS and Windows 10. With the Pixel Slate having rumored to have the same capabilities, might not necessarily be a mean a good thing. Since Windows 10 already has a vast user base, there is a huge possibility that the Chrome OS might fail in this tablet. Which would be a shame considering that a hybrid convertible tablet, having the robustness to support  Chrome OS, Linux, Android and Windows 10 singularly is a bold yet an impressive move by Google.</p>
<p>But since Google has extended their Chrome OS to support Linux and Android apps, we can see  Chrome OS is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile OS.</p>
