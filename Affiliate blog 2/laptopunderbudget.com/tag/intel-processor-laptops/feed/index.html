										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 has been one of our most recommended gaming laptops since it was launch in 2017. We got a revision in 2018 with some changes in internals, but it was a mere spec bump as the chassis did not see anything new. In 2019, Acer has remastered it’s best selling machine by giving it a complete design overhaul and revamped thermals which Acer claims will lead to a significant difference in the experience of an average gamer.</p>
<p>When put to the test, the new Predator Helios 300 does deliver the claims made by the company while still keeping the price near to $1000. The new design appeals a look which is more modern than ever, the spec sheet with the Core i7 9750H hexa core processor and Nvidia’s Turing graphics ticks all the checkboxes and leaves nothing more to be desired. The new cooling solution also seems to help a lot. Overall, on the performance front, Acer has delivered the no-nonsense gaming machine which every gamer always asked for.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design is the most improved aspect of this machine. The 2019 Predator Helios 300 has an entirely new blue design which calls for a breath of fresh air after years of generic red and black gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The laptop has an aluminum top surface and deck, which combined with the sturdy hinge, provide the feel of strong build quality. It does add a little bit of weight though, the laptop weighs 5.1 lbs (2.3 kg) which is not light by any means, but it is slightly lighter and slimmer than the <a title="Acer Predator Helios 300 Review (PH315-51-78NP) – Breaking Stereotypes of Budget Gaming Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-review-ph315-51/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous generation</a>. It is still on the bulkier side but in line with the competition and portable enough to carry in a backpack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5868 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-2019-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 (2019) Gaming Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="680" height="400" /></p>
<p>The design is ergonomic and minimalist. The only problem I faced was that the outline is a little angular which caused some trouble while typing and needs getting used to. Apart from that, the overall new design language by Acer was a much needed change and will be appreciated by every user.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 houses a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS display, which has a refresh rate of 144 Hz and a response time of 3ms. On-paper, the display is on par with the other <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costly gaming laptops</a> out there.</p>
<p>The thin bezels add to the clean design language that Acer is going for. The 79% screen-to-body ratio provides the laptop with a sleek and modern look. They are not super-thin, so it can house the webcam up top unlike modern ultrabooks even though nobody is going to use it because it’s only good enough for video calls as there is no Windows Hello support.</p>
<div id="attachment_5871" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-image-5871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL 1080p 144Hz Display Review" width="612" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Best Display in Sub-$1000 Gaming Laptops Category</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The color accuracy is better than average with 97% SRGB and 75% ARGB color gamut. It’s not <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect for color accurate work</a>, but more than enough for a great gaming experience. The peak brightness of the panel was recorded at 343 nits which should result in good visibility outdoors.</p>
<p>The panel does suffer from backlight bleed issues. It is not the same on all the laptops and will depend totally on luck if your panel is unusable in a worst-case scenario. Backlight bleed does not affect gaming or reading text a lot, where it’s most noticeable is movies that have black bars on the corners of the screen.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard and trackpad are the most easily underlooked parts in <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptops</a>. The keyboard on this laptop is similar on the inside as the last year’s model. Even though it looks different with the blue accents and RGB backlighting, the underlying functionality and the layout is the same for the most part.</p>
<div id="attachment_5873" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-image-5873 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Trackpad.jpg" alt="2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Trackpad Review" width="750" height="484" /><p id="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>White Backlit Keyboard with Blue Accent</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Small improvements are made to the keyboard like increased key travel distance and 4 zone RGB backlight instead of the red backlight from last year. Some lower configurations don’t have the complete customizable RGB backlighting but only a subtle white light which is still better than red.</p>
<p>The trackpad has a plastic surface; it is inferior to glass trackpads but does the job. It does not suffer any hiccups or misreads thanks to windows precision drivers. The size is also good enough. Both the trackpad and keyboard are easy to get used to, and most people will find them comfortable to use without any complaints.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The new Acer Predator Helios 300 features the same specifications as any other $1200 gaming laptop in 2019, a hexa-core i7-9750H CPU that can boost up to 4.5 GHz on a single core and 4.0 GHz on all cores, 16GB of dual-channel memory and Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics with 6GB of GDDR6 virtual memory.</p>
<p>However, the spec sheet is not where it’s at. The optimization and tuning done by Acer take this laptop one step ahead of the competition. It comes factory-undervolted, which allows the CPU to maintain boost clock while sucking less power and generating less heat as a result. The ‘Turbo’ button overclocks the GPU and runs the fans at max speed to get the most out of the machine. Acer has taken care of every small detail which allows this laptop to edge out the competition. One thing to note here is that Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti comes in a few different configurations meant for different form factor designs. The Predator Helios 300 houses a full 80W TDP configuration of the GTX 1660 Ti. It’s safe to say it is the most powerful GTX 1660 Ti laptop out there.</p>

<p>The rest of the components are pretty well balanced; there are a few storage options to choose from. You can configure the laptop on Amazon with either a 256GB or a 512GB NVMe SSD. The read and write speeds are similar to most NVMe SSDs out there. On the inside, there are 2x SODIMM memory slots, 2x M.2 drive slots and an empty 2.5-inch drive bay to add a SATA SSD or a spinning HDD of your choice. Ram, storage and WiFi card can easily be upgraded by opening only a few screws. Acer has ensured the machine is very user-friendly to upgrade and service.</p>

<p>Gaming performance is where the 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 shines; it manages to stick out from the stack of all GTX 1660 Ti laptops by beating every single one of them. The dual-channel memory helps to achieve better 1% lows, and the experience is seamless. The CPU stayed at peak boost frequency all the time while playing Battlefield V.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of competitive multiplayer titles, dropping the graphics settings a bit can help max out the fps to match the display’s 144 Hz refresh-rate which is the best way to enjoy these titles.</p>
<h3>Thermals &amp; Acoustics</h3>
<p>The two fans, one dedicated to the CPU and GPU each, exhaust air out of the four vents, two on the rear, and two on the sides. Acer has done a great job of keeping this laptop cool by pre-undervolting the CPU. Under full load, the keyboard deck stays under a manageable 50°C. The CPU temperature reached a high of 85°C, and the GPU touched a max of 70°C. These temperatures are easily manageable, and no thermal throttling or power limit throttling was noticed. The testing was done with an ambient temperature of 22°C, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<div id="attachment_5874" style="width: 667px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-image-5874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3D-Aero-Blade-Fans-on-2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="New 3D Aero Blade Fans on 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop" width="657" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Improved 4th Gen 3D Aero Blade Fans for Better Airflow</strong></em></p></div>
<p>If you’re doing any CPU-heavy tasks on this laptop, you’re going to see the best results with the Turbo profile that can be initiated with the Turbo button on the deck. It automatically sets the optimum clock speed for the GPU and provides the CPU 25% more power to work with. It does increase the fan noise to slightly uncomfortable 55dB as it ramps up the fans to max speed. But that’s a sacrifice you’re going to have to make to maximize performance. It’s unnoticeable when you have headphones on.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>On the left, the laptop features a Kensington lock, power connector, an RJ45 ethernet jack, 2x USB 3.1 ports, and a combo headphone jack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5876 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Gaming Laptop Ports and Slots" width="708" height="602" /></p>
<p>On the right, we see a full-size HDMI port, a mini DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.1 port, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port.</p>
<p>The only thing missing here is an SD card slot, which is a bummer for <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative professionals</a> who use SD cards to transfer data to and from cameras. The type-c port, sadly, does not support Thunderbolt 3.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery on this laptop is a 58 Wh unit. Battery backup was recorded at 3-3.5 hours while doing normal tasks like browsing and watching a video with screen brightness at 250 nits and using Nvidia Optimus to force use the integrated Intel graphics. Under load, while gaming or doing any heavy tasks, don’t expect more than 45 minutes of juice out of the small battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5882 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-PH315-52-78VL-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Review - best gaming laptop in $1000 price range" width="628" height="500" /></p>
<p>The 180W AC adapter is fairly large but can be easily managed in a backpack. It adds some weight making the package about 6.1 lbs (2.8 kg) heavy to carry around.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>For $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 provides amazing value when compared to the competition. Not only does this machine outperform every <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other similarly priced laptop</a>, it does so without any compromises. With the out of the box CPU undervolt, Acer has knocked this one out of the park.</p>
<p>The balanced specifications on this laptop make it a good buy for gamers and content creators. It has a good screen, a stellar keyboard, can be easily upgraded, provides excellent gaming performance, and stays cool while doing so. The price drops to below $1100 often, and in the Black Friday sale, it dropped to a lowest of $930, which makes the Predator Helios 300 the best bang for the buck gaming laptop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Looking for a laptop which can replace your high-end desktop? Then you need to look at nowhere than the best intel i7 processor laptops because laptops powered by an intel i7 processor are one of the most powerful laptops among intel processor laptops and therefore they are the most suitable portable machines for power demanding tasks like gaming, video and film editing, music production, CAD, etc. Well, if you go one step down, then Intel i5 processor laptops are still great affordable performers. So, do you really need an i7 laptop? Which are the best core i7 laptops available to buy? Let&#8217;s find it out&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-600"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Intel is a giant in manufacturing computer hardware, and when it comes to processors, Intel has their flagship processor in the form of &#8216;Intel Core i9 processor&#8217;, and it is the best gaming and creation laptop processor Intel has ever built, but it is not for everyone. It offers 6 cores and has 12 threads with a clock frequency of up to 4.8 GHz which will be overkill for average users like you and me. Intel Core i9 CPU is best suited to power users like videographers who have to edit high-resolution videos or engineers for 3D designing. For normal users who want to multitask or play the newest games at respectable frame rates and edit photos and videos, <em>Intel Core i7 processor is still the best option</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">Intel Core i7 processor is powering millions (if not billions) of PCs and laptops around the world. And, if we talk about the &#8216;laptops&#8217; specifically, then Intel i7 processor laptops is still known for their desktop-class performance and power saving capabilities. However, the performance of every core i7 laptop differs with the different model of the Intel i7 processor installed in the laptop.</p>
<p class="p1">So next question that might be hitting your mind right now is;</p>

<p>So now you might have decided, with which Intel core i7 processor model you will go for your new laptop&#8230;</p>
<p>But wait..!</p>
<p>Have you checked laptops powered by i5 processors? Because i5 processor laptops are great affordable all-around performers and some of them even outperform laptops powered by Intel i7 processor. Yes, that&#8217;s true! The H-Series quad-core i5 processor laptops are powerful than U-Series quad-core i7 processor laptops and they are cheaper too!</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s again confusion &#8211;</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5692 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3D-Mark-of-Intel-i5-i7-CPU-Score.png" alt="3DMark of Intel Processors Score" width="538" height="428"></p>
<h5>X264 HD Benchmark Test of Intel Processors Score</h5>
<p>X264 HD is a benchmark test that measures how fast a CPU can transcode 1080p video clip into an x264 file. If you are going to do a lot of high definition video rendering on your i7 laptop, then this score will show you the comparison of it with Intel Core i5 processors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5693 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/X264-Benchmark-Processor-Score.png" alt="X264 Video Transcoding Intel CPU Stress Test Score" width="533" height="430">As you can see that in all the benchmark tests, Intel Core i7-8565U loses against Intel Core i5-9300H, that&#8217;s because i5-9300H has higher base clock frequency than the i7-8565U. So, for performance-oriented works, the quad-core i5 is a lot better than the quad-core i7 powered laptop.</p>
<p>So definitely, it is better to buy a laptop with the H-Series (i5-9300H &amp; i5-8300H) quad-core i5 processor rather than buying the laptop with U-Series (i7-8565U &amp; i7-8550U) quad-core i7 processor but there&#8217;s also one benefit of buying an Intel i7 processor laptop over i5 processor laptop, and that is <strong>battery efficiency</strong>. The U-series Intel i7 processor is more energy efficient than H-series Intel i5 processor so battery backup of i7 quad core laptops will be much higher than quad-core i5 processor laptops.</p>

<p>When it comes to productivity and reliable battery life, no other brands till now have come any closer to the tech-giant Apple’s MacBook series of laptops.

The laptop looks premium and is even more thinner and lighter than the previous MacBook Air at a mere 0.61-inches and 2.7 pounds respectively.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Air runs macOS Mojave out of the box and comes preloaded with a host of useful apps. It is powered by a Y-series Intel Core i5 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. It&#8217;s an ample example to explain that specifications aren&#8217;t everything, but it is the mutual working between hardware and software of a device which makes it efficient.</p>
<p>Though the laptop is not as powerful as its competitors in the list, it is surely capable of outlasting most laptops with i5 processor when it comes to productivity. Speaking of productivity, the new MacBook Air for the first time comes with the Retina display, new butterfly mechanism keyboard with Touch ID and a large trackpad similar to the MacBook Pro laptops from Apple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a bit pricey, though. It starts at $1099 and for the price you get a very basic set of specifications. Although it can be configured with more RAM and storage, those upgrades adds up a lot to the price.</p>

<h3 id="L5">5. Dell XPS 13 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Ultrabook with 8th Generation Intel i5 Processor</span></h3>

<p>Dell&#8217;s XPS lineup of laptops has always been one of the best premium Windows ultrabooks packed with the newest hardware and features. The <a title="Dell XPS 13 (2018) Review – Best Windows Ultrabook Money can Buy" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/dell-xps-13-2018-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 Dell XPS 13</a> was one of our favorite Windows ultrabooks, but it had one major flaw. Its webcam was a nose peeker as it was located on the bottom bezel of the display. The latest 2019 Dell XPS 13 fixes this problem, and we think it is the perfect Windows ultrabook to date. It is made from the premium materials like carbon fiber, glass, and aluminum and comes in two svelte looking finishes, namely platinum silver and frost white. It is very thin and weighs less than 3 pounds but still manages to pack latest Whiskey Lake Intel Core i5 quad-core processor inside making it an equally capable ultrabook.</p>
<p>Its 13.3-inch full HD InfinityEdge display is a treat to the eyes, and it is also very bright and color-accurate panel. On the hardware front, it bolsters an 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD, which should be enough for most users. The ports, however, are very limited on the 2019 model, as it comes with only 3 USB Type-C ports and an SD card slot. While those Type-C ports do support thunderbolt connections, but to connect any traditional USB device you will need a dongle. Apart from that, there is no additional graphics card provided with the laptop and thus, can serve the gaming purpose to a limited extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the Dell XPS 13 is still the best thin and light i5 powered ultrabook, which is powerful enough to be an excellent daily performer.</p>

It is powered by the latest Whiskey Lake Intel Core i5 processor with integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics.

<p>It offers an 8GB of RAM for smooth multitasking, and for storage, it comes with a speedy 256GB of SSD. However, like most ultrabooks, the RAM is soldered on the motherboard of the Pavilion 13 making its hardware impossible to upgrade.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to be outdone, Lenovo unveiled a lot at CES 2019, including a refresh of their Legion gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Taking center stage to unveil their new Legion Y740 (17-inch and 15-inch) and Y540 (15-inch) models, which are both refreshes of the Y730 and Y530 gaming laptops that they released last year, Lenovo&#8217;s latest line of gaming laptops will both be equipped with the latest Intel 8th Gen Processors and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.</p>
<h2 class="speakableTextP1">What&#8217;s New with the Legion Gaming Laptops?</h2>
<p>For the Legion Y740, users can opt for various configurations per unit. This includes the option to have up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM installed, as well as either a 15-inch or a 17-inch display with optional 144Hz refresh rate and NVIDIA G-SYNC support. Both device sizes will also come equipped with beautiful RGB backlit keys powered by the iCUE software by Corsair; support for Dolby Vision HDR software for ultra-vivid picture quality; a significantly brighter screen at up to 500 nits; and finally, a Dolby Atmos Speaker System with Dolby Sound Radar for improved audio quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while both devices can come with either the Intel Core i5-8300H or Intel Core i7-8750H, only the 17-inch model can come equipped with the latest the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU, while the 15-inch model will have to &#8220;settle&#8221; with the NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<div id="attachment_5107" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-image-5107 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Legion-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Legion Gaming Laptops" width="900" height="549" /><p id="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-caption-text">The Lenovo Legion Y740</p></div>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, the more affordable 15-inch gaming laptop won&#8217;t lag too far behind its bigger siblings in terms of specs. It will come equipped with a yet unannounced Intel Core processor and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU. Also, at only 5.1 pounds, what the Y540 lacks in power, it makes up for with portability. Lenovo also equipped the Y540 with Harman Kardon speakers and support for Dolby Atmos for an immersive gaming experience, as well as a white backlit keyboard with a response time of under 1ms.</p>
<p>Other important notable features available across all models include support for various storage options (512GB PCIe SSD, 512GB SATA SSD, and a 2TB SATA HDD), a better cooling system, longer battery life, and an improved aluminum display hinge for added monitor stability.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Lenovo plans to make their latest line of Legion gaming laptops available later this year.</p>
<p>Lenovo will begin shipping out the 15-inch and 17-inch Legion Y740 laptops first in February. The 15-inch model will start at $1,749.99 and the 17-inch model will start at $1,979.99.</p>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, Lenovo will start shipping the lower-specced laptops out in May starting at $929.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2019, Razer announced an updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop, including an &#8220;Advanced Model&#8221; that comes with a 144Hz Full HD display and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<h3>Better, and More Powerful, the Updated Razer Blade 15</h3>
<p>Given the cult-like following Razer has amassed throughout the years, any product the Singapore-based gaming company releases needs very little introduction. These things pretty much hype themselves up. This includes the Razer Blade 15, which according to Razer&#8217;s announcement at CES 2019, is going to receive a nice spec upgrade.</p>
<p>For the updated Razer Blade 15, Razer decided to stick to the same dimensions and aesthetics as last year. However, the refresh is anything but on the inside. The new Razer Blade 15 will come with modest but noticeable changes under the hood. For starters, it can now come equipped with up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU. However, the other specs will remain the same with last year&#8217;s model, including the 144Hz Full HD display.</p>
<p>At its highest configuration, you&#8217;re getting an eighth-generation Intel Core i7-8750H, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and up to 512GB of fast SSD storage. This is in addition to the aforementioned NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. The entry-level model, which comes with the last-gen GPU, the NVIDIA GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU, will continue to remain on sale.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor</a></strong></p>

<p>Razer also delighted a lot of their fans at CES 2019 with another announcement; they announced that they will be updating the widely successful <a title="Razer Blade 15 Gets Affordable Base Model and New White Color Option" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/razer-blade-15-gets-affordable-model-new-white-color-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury White edition of the Razer Blade 15</a>. The updated Razer Blade 15 Mercury White edition will now be available with either the NVIDIA RTX 2060 or the NVIDIA RTX 2070 MAX-Q GPU. Razer plans to make both configurations available for purchase online at Razer.com. However, the latter will also be made available exclusively at Best Buy.</p>
<h3>More Potential Features Down the Line</h3>
<p>Razer also showcased two potential new display technologies that could come to the Razer Blade 15 in the future.</p>
<p>The first is a 240Hz Full HD Display for an even more fluid gaming experience. Meanwhile, the second is a 4K OLED touch display that blends amazing color reproduction and efficient performance. But, that&#8217;s not all. Aside from showcasing the potential upgrades to the Razer Blade 15, Razer also announced that all the Advanced Models of the updated Razer Blade 15 will have their displays calibrated individually. Razer explains that this is to ensure &#8220;amazing color accuracy out of the box.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_5099" style="width: 769px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5099" class="wp-image-5099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Razer-Blade-15-2019-Advanced-Model.jpg" alt="Razer Blade 15 2019 Advanced Model" width="759" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2019 Model</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Regardless of specification differences, each Razer Blade 15 model will come with ultra-thin 4.9mm bezels and facial recognition support for Windows Hello via its IR face camera. The dual-array microphone setup for streaming, conferencing, and voice assistant use is also available across all models.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>The updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 20-series GPUs will all ship beginning January 29. This includes the Mercury Edition with the NVIDIA RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU. From the said date onwards, you can find them online at Razer.com or in select retailers in US.</p>
<p>For those who can no longer wait, the Base Model of the Razer Blade 15 is already available for purchase at select retailers and Razer.com. It will come equipped with an NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU with Max-Q design and a 60Hz Full HD display.</p>
<p>The pricing for the Razer Blade 15 will start at $1,599 for the Base Model and $2,299 for the updated Razer Blade 15 with the NVIDIA RTX 20-series GPUs.</p>

<p>Here we are going to have an in-depth look at the Acer Aspire 1 (A114-32-C1YA). I will be going through different aspects of the device, talking about the pros and cons as well as the things that I personally liked or disliked during my time with this laptop.</p>

<p>As you can see in the specs, the Acer Aspire 1 is powered by the Intel Celeron N4000 dual-core processor, which is based on Gemini Lake. The CPU has a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz and can boost to 2.6 GHz. The chip also comes with 4 MB of L2 cache. This is the same CPU that you get in the HP Stream 14. Other than that, you get 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>With that said, let&#8217;s begin with our review of Acer Aspire 1, talking about each aspect of the laptop, one by one.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 is an entry-level laptop from Acer, so there isn&#8217;t really anything fancy about the design but it is still a robust machine, and overall it is very clean. The exterior of the laptop looks stylish, especially the brushed aluminum finish on the lid with silver Acer logo in the center. On opening the lid, you&#8217;ll find the same finish around the keyboard and touchpad area as well. While there is nothing to brag about the design of this laptop, it manages not to look cheap.</p>

<p>However, there are certain design flaws on this laptop, and one of them is its bad speaker placement. The laptop has two speakers at the bottom, one on either side, and its poor placement muffled the sound everytime I used the laptop from my lap. If we talk about the sound quality, then it isn&#8217;t that great either. Its two speakers do get loud enough to fill the small-sized room, but I felt a lack of clarity while listening to music. But, considering that this is a $200 laptop, some sacrifice needed to be made, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Talking about the internal design, getting to the internals of this laptop was very hard. I had to open fifteen screws and had to pull the back panel off to gain access to the parts, but that&#8217;s fine because there are no upgradable parts inside the laptop. The RAM and storage drive is soldered on the motherboard, and that makes users stuck with its low 4GB of RAM which kind of bottlenecks its overall performance (more on this later). Moreover, the internal design is fanless so you won&#8217;t be hearing any fan noise when you use the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_4886" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-image-4886 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Internal-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Internal Design" width="667" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Internal Design | RAM Soldered on Motherboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall the Acer Aspire 1 has decent build quality. The materials used do not feel like this is an entry-level device. The texture on the lid adds to the premiums of the laptop, and the laptop not only looks impressive but feels great as well. The device is pretty light, and you can easily take it with you.</p>

<h4>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h4>
<p>There are a couple of useful ports on this laptop that make it great for the price. You get an ethernet port that will allow you to plug in an ethernet cable if you want faster internet speeds and do not want to rely on a wireless connection. You also have an HDMI output port that will deliver 4K at 30 FPS. On the left, you have a USB 3.0 port to transfer data faster. You also get an SD card slot, but the card sticks out which can be an issue if you were looking to expand laptop&#8217;s limited storage with the SD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4887" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Left-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Left Side Ports" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you have the combo jack for headphones and two more USB 2.0 ports. These are slower ports that can be used to connect a mouse or other devices that do not require higher throughput.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Right-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="382" /></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you will be able to take advantage of high-speed internet and routers that use 5 GHz frequencies. The laptop also offers Bluetooth 4.1 which can be used to connect wireless devices like a mouse or a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display on the Aspire 1 is a 14-inch TN panel which does not offer great viewing angles, and as expected it isn&#8217;t color accurate either. The bright side is that while the screen is the same size as the HP Stream 14, it has a higher resolution. That said, the Acer Aspire 1 is the only laptop in this price segment to offer full HD display making it the perfect budget option for binge watchers.</p>
<div id="attachment_4890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-image-4890 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 - Display Review" width="800" height="637" /><p id="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>14-inch Full HD Matte Display</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The screen is a bit dim, but it has a matte coating on top which does a great job of reducing reflections while using this laptop in well-lit areas. Overall, it is a pretty decent panel keeping in mind that this laptop costs just a little <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200</a>.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature is that the screen can be rotated more than 180 degrees. The Acer Aspire 1 is in no means a 2-in-1 device, so I do not really know what Acer is trying to do with this feature, but you can have the screen flat on a surface if you want. The hinge does have a bit of range, and that might keep the screen from snapping off.</p>

<h3>Keyboard And Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard on the Acer Aspire 1 is very impressive, the keys have ample travel, and they are decent to type on. The keys are also a bit larger than usual which is great for typing. The only issue is that the placement of some keys can take a bit of getting used to. You will need to adjust to the arrangement of the small arrow keys and the buttons next to the Enter and Backspace keys. This is not a major issue, and once you have used the device for a few hours, you should get used to it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Review-Keyboard-and-Touchpad.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="750" height="590" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is much better than some previous <a title="All Acer Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> that we have used in the past, and the overall design is decent. The touchpad is not all that great though. It is a bit wobbly, but it will get the job done. It uses Windows Precision drivers and supports gestures as well. Compared to the HP Stream 14, the keyboard is fine, but the touchpad could have been better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks of Laptops for Writers with Comfortable Keyboards</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The webcam on the Aspire 1 is another thing after speakers that Acer has compromised to price it competitively. Acer has fitted a very bad webcam on this laptop which produces an unacceptable picture and video quality, even as per the budget laptop standards. The picture that I took of mine with its webcam came out entirely out of focus, grainy and with vanished colors.</p>
<p>So, if you have to make a lot of video calls everyday or attend the video conferences, then this is not the right laptop for you unless you are ready to spend a bit extra for an <a title="External Webcams on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LH16yf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">external webcam</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode which is excellent for students and individuals who need added security. For uninitiated, the S mode limits the third party apps that you can download, and you can only use apps that are verified by Microsoft and are available on the official Microsoft store. Well, if you don&#8217;t like it, opting out of the S mode is not an issue, and you can move to regular Windows 10 Home with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Software-and-Warranty-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Software and Warranty Review" width="735" height="550" /></p>
<p>Along with Window 10, there are a couple of other apps and games as well that come pre-installed. These include the Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Friends Saga, Cooking Fever, Township, Royal Revolt 2, Fitbit Coach, Photastic Collage, ACG player and Amazon. All these apps can be uninstalled, so it&#8217;s not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The laptop also comes with a free year of Office 365 and the Acer Product registration app which you will need to register your device, check the warranty and get customer support.<br />

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 is a netbook with the dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM, so I did not have high hopes when testing the device and it seems that I was right for the most part. The 4 GB of RAM is a major limitation, and it took only four Chrome tabs to get the device to slow down. With eight tabs open in Chrome and one of them playing a YouTube video, there was a noticeable lag when typing.</p>
<p>While this is not a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming machine</a>, we did play Asphalt 9 on the device, and it ran well. There was no noticeable lag, but then again, the game is very well optimized and will even run on smartphones. We also tried Cooking Fever that came pre-installed, and that ran fine as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Real-Life-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Real Life Performance" width="527" height="700" /></p>
<p>As far as thermals are concerned, the device’s bottom does get a bit warm even while normal multi-tasking possibly because of its fanless design. It can be problematic for users like me who like to use the laptop by keeping it on the lap. However, it was completely usable when kept on the table, and its keyboard and palm rest area didn’t show any signs of heat which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Acer Aspire 1 isn&#8217;t great when it comes to multitasking and although it will run games found on the official store just fine, you cannot expect to play games on it. Opening multiple apps or even Chrome tabs will slow it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>Recommended: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The claimed battery life of the 2018 Acer Aspire 1 is around 6.5 hours, and in our tests, it managed to last for 7 hours and 12 minutes which is decent, but there are options in the market that will give you 8-9 hours of battery backup. That is a factor worth considering if you are someone who has to rely a lot on battery power every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laptop took 2 hours and 17 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% which is also a little longer than the other laptops. So, the battery on the Acer Aspire 1 takes its time to charge and does not offer much in terms of battery life either.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Under $200 &#8211; Our Most Recommended Inexpensive Laptops</a></strong></em> </div></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Laptop-Review-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Laptop Review - Featured Image" width="650" height="483" /></p>
<p>One of the strongest points of the Acer Aspire 1 is its 14-inch full HD display which makes hard to find a substitute for this laptop. Moreover, it offers plenty of ports and comes with modern wireless connectivity options so that you can take advantage of high-speed internet and connect your wireless devices. Although its speakers lack in clarity and have an awful webcam, one cannot go wrong with it considering it costs just $250.</p>
<p>So, overall the Acer Aspire 1 is a solid laptop for the price if you consume content online or work with documents. It can handle some mobile games that are available on the Microsoft store and is a well-built machine overall. The storage and RAM are the limiting factors, but if all you need is a device on which you can create documents, browse the web and watch movies, then this is one of the best inexpensive laptops right now that will get the job done.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>

<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer is one such company, which has made its name and fame in the gaming laptop segment. The company has been launching powerful gaming laptops in various segments at various price points. Acer’s Predator series of laptops are globally reputed for their performance and power.</p>
<p>With the company launching multiple devices in the gaming laptop market such as the beastly Predator 21X and the sleek and stylish Predator Triton 700, the company has recently updated their already well-known Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop. The 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is a very straightforward, powerful, and no-nonsense gaming laptop. The device carries a lot of USPs with it and offers an improved and powerful gaming performance for the asking price.</p>
<p>Priced at under $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 offers all the current generation hardware and the fast refresh-rate display which has made it gain rapid popularity. We spent a good amount of time with the device to test its caliber. And, here is what we think of it.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5dd91;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#fff7ab;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The new variant of Acer Predator Helios 300 is already launched.

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design, there isn’t much of an upgrade here. Having said that, the 2018 Helios 300 looks exactly identical to the last year’s model.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Helios 300 at the very first glance looks to be much thinner and compact than that of the other laptops in the segment. However, when you hold the device and start using it, you’ll realize that it, in fact, is on a bulkier side. The device comes with a dimension of 10.47 x 15.35 x 1.05 inches, which is a little wider and thicker for a 15-inch laptop. The device weighs slightly over 5.5 pounds and can be quite cumbersome to carry around. However, considering the fact that it is a gaming laptop and has a lot of engineering within, it might not be an issue for most of us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Design" width="650" height="406" /></p>
<p>Acer this time has come up with newer color variants, to give gamers a choice. It has unveiled the special edition Acer Predator Helios 300, which comes clad in a white-and-gold chassis. However, we still don&#8217;t know when it will hit the stores.</p>
<p>The one which we tested looks just like its predecessor and has the same angular design going all around with red and black color scheme. Its aluminum lid has a huge Predator logo and a red lining on either side which gives it a proper gaming hue, however, it doesn&#8217;t light up like Alienware and some <a title="All MSI Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/msi-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end MSI laptops</a>.</p>
<p>Most gamers would love the design of this laptop, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an out of the box gaming laptop design, then the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) might not please you that much.</p>
<div id="attachment_3941" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Lid-design.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 - Lid design" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Premium looking Metal Lid with Huge Predator Logo and Red Lines on Either Side</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the build quality, there is a lot of plastic used in the making of chassis of this laptop. However, there are no compromises with the build quality and laptop feels very solid to hold. Moreover, it comes with a pretty ergonomic form-factor making it subtle to carry around and use.</p>
<p>As far as ports and slots are concerned, they are neatly recessed on both sides of the laptop and they are smartly placed in a way that wired gaming mouse won&#8217;t hinder your gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Almost all the Acer Predator series of laptops come with a short-stroke keyboard, which might not often be preferred for gaming. The keys on the Helios 300, comes with a travel of the only 1.2mm into the frame on a press, which is not much. This affects the tactile feedback on the keyboard. However, this doesn’t hold true for regular usage including documents editing and other general tasks.</p>
<p>However, the gamers will like the keys on the device as they are very brightly backlit and come in non-changeable red color hue to match the styling. The keys come with a slight curve, which adds on to the typing experience nonetheless.</p>
<div id="attachment_3943" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3943" class="wp-image-3943 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="800" height="491" /><p id="caption-attachment-3943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong><em>Iron Red Backlit Keyboard with 1.2mm Key Travel</em></strong></p></div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><strong><em>You May Like to Check out: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptop for Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</em></strong></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the trackpad on the device, it is made out of plastic and evidently, one can feel that right away. Although the tactile feedback and the touch sensitivity on the trackpad are fine-tuned, we felt the lack of richness, we ought to get on gaming laptops over $1000. However, it can still take up all the everyday essentials with ease without dropping a sweat.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD widescreen display and it is an IPS LED-backlit panel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What makes it unique though is its fast 144Hz refresh rate</span>. Meaning, the rapid refresh rate shortens the time it takes for frame rendering and provides gamers with an excellent in-game experience. This helps especially when you’re gaming or watching the high-quality video files.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3946" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-PH315-51-78NP-144Hz-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP) 144Hz Display Review" width="900" height="667" /></p>
<p>The display can get bright up to 300 nits and produces a decent 70% NTSC and 90% sRGB color gamut on the scale, making it good enough for content creators. We also played some 4K content on the laptop, and the details were very precise, that we could see every minute detail played.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops for Photo Editing with Most Color Accurate Display</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Overall, the display on the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) gaming laptop is one of its unique selling points and without a doubt, it is one of the best display-equipped mid-range gaming laptop available to buy right now.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the hardware of the device, Acer Predator Helios 300 comes with powerful innards, which makes it one of the latest in the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segment of mid-range gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by a latest 8th gen Intel Core i7-8750H hexa-core processor with clock frequency of up to 4.1GHz and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 video memory. The duo of this CPU and GPU makes it one of the most powerful and value for money gaming laptops available for the asking price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops</a> (8th Gen)</strong></em></div></div>
<p>For multitasking, the laptop has a huge 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of PCIe based NVMe SSD. Although this might not be sufficient to store huge data, be mindful, the SSD storage offered in this laptop is at least 4 times faster than that of the traditional HDD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_3947" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Hardware-and-Upgradability.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-78NP Hardware and Upgradability" width="800" height="546" /><p id="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>New Dual Fan Cooling System | Easy to upgrade RAM (Up to 32GB) and Storage</strong> <em>&#8211; Image taken from Dave Lee YouTube Channel</em></p></div>
<p>To the gamers rejoice, hardware on the Predator Helios 300 is quite easy to upgrade. The laptop&#8217;s back panel gives access to its two RAM slots one of which is empty and it also has an empty storage drive bay inside to upgrade its low storage with the hard drive or another SSD. The WiFi card is also easily accessible but we don&#8217;t think it needs to be changed as the Gigabit card that the laptop comes equipped with, works flawlessly and provides excellent WiFi reception.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming stationed laptop, we expect a lot of additional peripherals to be connected to the device. Accordingly, the Helios 300 comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C port which can support speeds of up to 5GBps. It also sports a USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports. There is an HDMI 2.0 port to plug in the additional display if needed. The HDMI port available comes with HDCP support. Apart from these, it also comes with a microSD card reader, an RJ45 Ethernet port, headphone jack, and a charging port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ports-and-Slots-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="800" height="367" /></p>
<p>The only disappointment here is its USB Type-C port which doesn&#8217;t support the Thunderbolt 3. We expected this year&#8217;s model with Thunderbolt 3 as the last year&#8217;s model didn&#8217;t had it. However, it isn&#8217;t a huge problem if you don&#8217;t plan to use the External GPU or other Thunderbolt accessories.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We spent a decent time gaming and doing other mediocre to demanding tasks on this laptop. The laptop stood up to the expectations and did well in terms of providing reliable performance and efficiency. We tested the laptop by <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rendering video</a> on the Adobe Premiere and even played some AAA games at high graphics settings. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop was able to handle our multitasking and gaming tests quite easily.</p>
<p>A gaming laptop is often discredited due to its heating issues but to our surprise, this year&#8217;s Acer Predator Helios 300 did well in terms of thermal management, despite having powerful CPU and GPU inside it. Thanks to its new all-metal dual AeroBlade fans and huge exhaust vents at the back, the laptop dissipates all the inside heat out and allows CPU and GPU to work at its full potential.</p>
<p>The data transfer speeds and superfast app loading speeds are yet another impressive aspects of this laptop. Its 256GB PCIe NVME SSD doesn&#8217;t offer adequate room, but it does help in reducing the bootup times and load times of games and other applications.</p>
<p>Speaking about the benchmarks, we ran a couple of benchmark tests on the laptop to find out its actual potential. Accordingly, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (with i7-8750H and GTX 1060) scored a good P13214 on the 3DMark 11 and a 19800 on multi-core and 4560 on single-core tests via Geekbench 4 64-bit. These scores are on par with most of the other offerings in the segment which makes the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) again king of the mid-range gaming laptops segment.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>All credits to the powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics baked in, the Helios 300 does deliver exceptionally well-performance for the mid-range gaming stationed laptop. We had a good time playing games on it and even at the highest graphics settings, laptop managed to deliver the respectable framerates. However, the fans get quite vocal while gaming and its battery lasted for just 58 minutes in our gaming tests.</p>

<p>The laptop also supports virtual reality, but GTX 1060 isn&#8217;t the best GPU you can get for the VR related tasks. We tested its VR capabilities by playing some VR games, and the laptop managed to run all of them. However, the experience wasn&#8217;t the smoothest and GPU did felt a bit underpowered for VR. But, the GPU is overclockable and overclocking does reduce the lag up to an extent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Like the last year&#8217;s model, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 also comes with the same dual stereo speakers located on the bottom front of the laptop. They are backed by the Acer’s proprietary Acer TruHarmony audio tech and Dolby Audio premium, which claims to enhance the audio quality. However, the audio isn&#8217;t the loudest and its sound gets suppressed due to the bad placement of speakers.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#b3b3b3;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#cdcdcd;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You May Like to Check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life on the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is definitely not the main selling point as it comes with the same 4-cell Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery that we saw in the last year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the laptop can provide up to 7 hours of continuous usage, during our real-time usage, we managed to sustain the battery for close to 4 hours with normal usage. However, while gaming the battery life dropped to a mere 58 minutes which is tad disappointment and less as per the gaming laptop&#8217;s standards of 2018. Moreover, it takes up to two and a half hours to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>So, battery on the new Predator Helios 300 is another thing after design, Acer has used to cut manufacturing costs, and that can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If one is looking for a powerful mid-range gaming laptop, then the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is our top pick right now. It checks a lot of right boxes with its segment first 144Hz display, powerful and latest hardware, and a rather old yet good built chassis. However, a bit heavy form factor, small battery and a 256GB of SSD might be a bit of concern for few. But it&#8217;s hard to find an alternative to this laptop, especially for the price that it comes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Aspire series of laptops are undeniably a complete value for money devices. After spending months on premium laptops, I have got the budget segment Acer Aspire E 15 laptop to review. It is a common tendency to focus on the flaws and deficits the laptop has as the styling, form-factor, features, and specifications of a budget laptop are definitely far behind that of premium devices.</p>
<p>However, to my surprise, the Aspire E 15 stood up really well exceeding my expectations from a laptop priced under $400. Quite frankly, you’ll have a hard time in finding a laptop with impressive specifications, a reliable battery backup, a full HD display, and an abundant amount of RAM <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for less than $400</a>. But, Acer has again hit the sweet spot in the budget segment and their 2018 Acer Aspire E 15 notebook offers all the current generation hardware with the steeped down price tag of just $379!</p>
<p>But, how is the build quality? And, how does it perform in real world? Let’s drill down to the detailed review of Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) laptop and find out if it really is the best budget laptop of 2018.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Usually, when a 15-inch laptop strikes in your mind, there is already a typical image in everyone’s mind and it is the very first and most common impression users get. However, it is not the same case with the Aspire E 15. The laptop although comes with an old-school design pattern, like most of the other 15-inch laptops, it comes with good ergonomics.</p>
<p>Weighing at 5.27 pounds, the laptop is a tab heavy and bulky. However, thanks to its design and engineering, the weight is very uniformly distributed all across the device, making it easy to carry around.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3869 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Design-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15-inch Laptop - Design &amp; Build Quality" width="550" height="480" /></p>
<p>The laptop looks completely identical to the last year&#8217;s model as its design has been carried forward from its predecessor (<a title="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop Review – A Solid Budget-Friendly Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e15-e5-575-33bm-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E5-575-33BM</a>) which is fine because Acer is providing better specs on this year&#8217;s model by cutting down its designing and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>As far as build quality is concerned, the laptop is built from a high quality poly-carbonate plastic and it is finished in black color and has a textured lid which gives it a rather aging yet professional look. The device comes with almost the standard dimensions in terms of length, width, and height and measures 15.02 x 10.2 x 1.19 inches. The laptop feels sturdy but it does have some amount of keyboard and screen flexes which are acceptable considering the price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the port alignment on the device, you get a DVD drive, a charging port, a USB port, and an audio jack aligned with the right edge of the device. On the left edge, you get a couple of USB ports, an HDMI port, and a LAN port, neatly recessed.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD display. The display panel on the laptop is an LED-backlit one, which offers decent resolution for all the essential everyday uses. It sports a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which also makes it one among the very few laptops offering a Full HD resolution in the segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_3870" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-image-3870 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-Laptop-Display-.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H Laptop Review - Display" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>15.6&#8243; Full HD Display &#8211; Best in Segment</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Although the laptop had a decent color accuracy, the brightness was relatively low at only 175 nits. However, the laptop’s display had punchy blacks and decent contrast levels. Watching quality video content on the laptop will be satisfying but the display’s underwhelming brightness might be a bit of concern for some users. However, considering the price point, the display is definitely serviceable.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 comes with latest and top of the line specifications for the asking price. Under the hood, the device sports an 8th generation Intel Core i3-8130U dual-core processor which is the biggest highlight of this year&#8217;s model. The Coffee Lake Intel Core i3 processor is clocked at 2.2 GHz and under full throttle it can turbo boost up to 3.4GHz. The latest processor also comes with an Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics for better overall graphical performance.</p>

<p>The latest processor on the device is paired with a 6GB of RAM which is 2GB more than the last year&#8217;s model, however it is slower DDR3L RAM and this laptop&#8217;s 4+2 RAM configuration also eats up both of its RAM slots. But the good news is, RAM on the laptop can be upgraded up to whopping 32GB. As far as storage on the device is concerned, it is managed by a slow 5400 RPM 1TB hard drive which can also be replaced easily with an SSD.</p>

<p>The laptop also comes with an 8X DVD Double-Layer RW (M-Disc enabled) drive which can read and write from any CD or a DVD.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The Aspire E 15 comes with a backlit keyboard, which is a very rare scene for a laptop priced under $400. The keyboard provides a very comfortable typing experience and comes with a very sturdy and sharp key. The keys provide very good tactile feedback while using and this definitely adds on to the great typing experience. On our typing tests, I hit a rate of 72 words per minute, which is great. One should have absolutely no issues in using this laptop’s keyboard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="750" height="445" /></p>

<p>The touchpad on the device is also very neatly recessed and is very spacious. It does the job adequately well and it comes with both the left and right clickers, like the usual touchpad on a keyboard.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with an abundant number of ports and other connectivity options, which makes the laptop stand out in the segment. It sports 1 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x USB Type-C port, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, an audio jack, and an SD card reader slot.</p>

<p>On top of this, the device also comes with a VGA and a DVD writer for the ease of usage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with an HD webcam which sports a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The webcam on the device also supports High Dynamic Range, for better imaging and rendering during a video call or telephony. However, the camera isn’t that great when it comes to capturing some still photographs. The image tends to get a little smoothened and blurred out, losing out on a lot of details in the image. The sensor is, however, fast enough to render the image and adjust it on the screen quickly. Having said that all, the camera on the device serves the cause.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer has always been an exceptionally good multipurpose laptop manufacturer. Accordingly, their Aspire E 15 notebook comes equipped with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two built-in stereo speakers</span> for a surround sound effect. We used the laptop to play heavy music including various genres such as metal, symphony, and mid-focused vocals. The laptop did well and has a powerful sound, which can fill a small room.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the speakers are powered by the company’s proprietary True Harmony sound, which ensures quality audio output with more depth and details. This adds on to the experience while watching movies and playing games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As for watching videos is concerned, the laptop can take it almost any video format at any resolution and play it with ease. We played true 4K content to which the laptop had no struggle playing it whatsoever.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H), being a sub-$400 budget laptop, is still an excellent multimedia performer.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 runs on the latest Windows 10 Operating system, which is confined to the Home variant by default. Apart from housing some of the proprietary applications form the company, the laptop also packs in some additional applications, which we want to term as bloatware.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we personally felt that the laptop comes with slightly more bloatware than that of an ordinary Windows 10 running laptop. Nonetheless, one can easily uninstall the preinstalled apps with ease. The <a title="Acer Laptops Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> come with Acer Recovery management application, which we feel is quite handy, especially if you’re someone who wants to explore more out of your device. Often, people mess up with it and lose their valuable data.</p>
<p>The display of the device comes with two settings, which can be chosen by the user as per their requirements. It comes with a third-party file explorer app known as the ‘App Explorer’, which organizes and sorts the files and folders in the laptop in a slightly better manner. It also comes with CyberLink PowerDVD 14 by default, to run the inbuilt DVD writer.</p>
<p>We faced absolutely no hiccups or hurdles while using the laptop during our review, and the software on the device, never really bothered us despite the bloatware it packs in.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Intel Core i3-8130U processor paired with the 6GB of memory in the Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop provides enough power and speed for productive multitasking on the laptop. During our review, we had multiple multitasking sessions and the laptop did quite well. We even used split screen feature of Windows to play a YouTube video in full HD resolution and running a bunch of benchmarks simultaneously, to which the laptop did quite well, without any lags or stutter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3874" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) 15-inch Laptop Review" width="550" height="530" /></p>
<p>Speaking about our benchmarks, the laptop scored a decent 7,140 on the Geekbench, which gives a pretty much overall performance of the device. This is on par with all the laptops priced under $400. However, the 1TB hard disk drive provided with the laptop had poor read, write and data transfer speeds.</p>
<p>We almost tested out all the connectivity options on the laptop too and it didn’t disappoint us. The device was latching on to the Wi-Fi networks quickly and had a good connectivity range.</p>
<p>As far as the gaming on the device is concerned, considering the price, one should be aware of the fact that, it is not meant for heavy gaming. However, the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics chipset does well for basic gaming. We tested the laptop with some mediocre games such as Dirt 3 racing with graphics set to minimal-medium levels and the laptop did well handling the game and graphics. However, one cannot expect to run heavy games on the device. But what you’re getting in this device at this price range makes it a total steal for the buck.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Our current laptop, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) comes with a 6-cell Li-Ion battery (each 2,800 mAh), which makes it one of the very few devices to come with a 6-cell offering in the segment. Accordingly, the device gives an exceptional battery backup of over 7-8 hours on a continuous usage. Although the company claims that the laptop will give a battery life of over 13 hours, it doesn’t really stand true.</p>
<p>The device takes slightly over 2 hours to charge fully from 0 to 100, which is rather okay for most users. The laptop’s battery life didn’t let us down whatsoever during our usage and this is definitely one of the strong zones of this device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3875" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-best-budget-laptop-of-2018-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 - best budget laptop of 2018 review" width="700" height="320" /></p>
<p>If you’re someone asking us ‘Should I buy this laptop?’, then the answer is ‘YES’ blindfolded. That said, there is undeniably no better competitor for the laptop at this price range, yet. It has powerful innards, offers good performance, lasts long in terms of battery life, and comes with powerful multimedia abilities. What more can you expect from a laptop at this price range?</p>
<p>However, we would have been taken by a storm, if the device had an even brighter display, as that is one of the very few areas, where the laptop falls short.</p>
