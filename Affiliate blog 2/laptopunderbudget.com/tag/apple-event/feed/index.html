										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the much-awaited <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-hold-us-ipad-pro-2018/">event of the Fall</a> finally happened today. As expected, we got a completely revamped MacBook Air and two improved iPad Pros for businesses, creators and design professionals.</p>
<p>Apple debuted 11.5 inch and 12.9 inch iPad Pro designs in their <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">October event</a> today. Both leaps and bounds ahead of the previous iPad models in terms of body, display, design and specs. Here is everything you need to know about the new and improved iPad Pros.</p>
<p>You can find our complete coverage on the MacBook Air from <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/new-2018-apple-macbook-air-announced/">this</a> article.</p>
<h3>Chassis design and Display</h3>
<p>The 11.5 inch display comes with the same proportion and footprint as the 10.5 inch model. The latter 12.9 inch iPad has been remodeled to fit an even smaller form factor than the previous. The Pros are 5.9mm in thickness, chopping down just 1mm from the slightly heavier iPad Pro.</p>
<p>For the screens, the iPad Pros are not given a complete edge to edge designs much like the iPhone X which is kind of a buzzkill, but it does come close. The bezels on the iPad Pros 2018 are much slimmer and debut new full-screen displays as well. The removal of the Home button also contributes to the larger view and are the first iPads to be launched without Touch ID. Eliminating the infinity display out of the equation, the iPad Pros do take after the iPhone XR&#8217;s quality of Liquid Retina display, the iPhone X&#8217;s gesture navigation, and the True Depth camera setup.</p>
<p>Also, not forgetting the most exciting addition of all &#8211; the Face ID. This one was much awaited to be introduced in the iPads after their massive success in the iPhones. Face ID brings a lot of fun features with itself such as the Animoji, Memoji, amongst others like Apple Pay.</p>
<div id="attachment_4516" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4516" class="wp-image-4516 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ipad_pro_notchless.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-4516" class="wp-caption-text">Apple iPad Pro&#8217;s notchless design | Image &#8211; The Verge</p></div>
<p>To our surprise, the camera for the Face ID and the sensors sit on the top of the bezel instead of the notch &#8211; another take on the iPhone X. So, if the iPad is connected with the Smart keyboard, the Face ID will be functional in landscape orientation.</p>
<h3>Horsepower and CPU</h3>
<p>Apple, for the 2018 iPad Pros has employed their latest A12X Bionic chip with an 8-core CPU and 7-core GPU. Apple putting their latest iPads on the fast track claims that their CPU integrations will give the new iPad Pros 35 percent faster single-core performance and a whopping 90 percent faster multi-core performance. It doesn&#8217;t end here, Apple also boasts that the iPad Pros will deliver 1000 times faster graphics performance. This is a literal game changer!</p>
<p>Apple’s Jon Ternus said;</p>
<blockquote><p>“the iPad Pro delivers Xbox One S class graphics performance in a package that is much smaller.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The battery remains untouched and unblemished maintaining the 10-hour benchmark as usual.</p>
<p>While Apple clings to Lightning connectors for their latest iPhones, they did shy away from it for their new iPads. Turns out that our suspicions for the USB-C connector addition in the iPads were, in fact, correct. This opens tremendous options of connectivity for the new iPads, for instance, connecting to the 5K resolution display and even power an iPhone. Another impressive upgrade is massive 1TB storage. Again, seen for the first time in the 2018 iPad Pros, that is a jump from the past 512GB.</p>
<p>The inclusion of USB-C port, the remarkable CPUs and the outstanding graphics all point towards one thing &#8211; Apple is rooting for their iPads to replace computers. While its a truly commendable effort on their part but the iPads still have a long way to go for qualifying from PC &#8216;alternatives&#8217; to PC &#8216;replacements&#8217;.</p>
<p>Both iPad Pro models also feature Bluetooth 5.0 and Smart HDR along with Gigabit LTE, an 18W charging brick but of course the headphone jack was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<h3>Smart Keyboard &#8216;Folio&#8217; and Apple Pencil accessories</h3>
<p>No upgrade is fun enough if it does not come with some exciting new add-ons. So, of course there are some accessories in the mix in the new iPad Pro launch.</p>
<div id="attachment_4519" style="width: 687px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4519" class="wp-image-4519" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ipad_pencil.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="451" /><p id="caption-attachment-4519" class="wp-caption-text">iPad Pro Pencil wireless charging | Image &#8211; The Verge</p></div>
<p>A whole new and upgraded Apple Pencil was unveiled that wakes the device when tapped on the screen and launches Notes. The tap gesture of the stylus is completely customizable with third party apps. Like in Photoshop, a single tap can trigger a zooming shortcut on the canvas. The charging method is pretty cool too and can be powered up by magnetically attaching itself on top of the device instead of having to plug it in the common way. To give the Stylus more balance, Apple has gone for a square cut design as it will be much easier to place the pencil on the iPad with a flat body or any other surface for that matter. The flat edge design coupled with a modern matte finish makes the stylus even easier to hold and use.</p>
<p>Speaking of magnetic attachment, the iPad keyboard has been given a major upgrade too. Unlike the previous ones, the new Smart keyboard Folio does not rely on the Smart connector and can work with magnetic attachment to the device. It also has the ability to adjust itself into two different typing angles and is a lot more than just a cover that folds out into a keyboard.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>The 11.5 inch iPad is priced from $799 (64GB) and the slightly larger 12.9-inch priced from $999. If you choose to opt for the 1TB and LTE with the 12.9-inch model, the cost goes all the way up to $1,899.</p>
<p>As for the accessories, Apple has announced that their new Smart Keyboard Folio, Smart Folio, and the USB-C to SD Card reader are available now for pre-order. The Smart Keyboard Folio for the 11-inch iPad Pro would cause a total damage of $179, and the 12.9-inch version runs up to $199. The Smart Keyboard for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro costs $159 and excludes the front and back coverage unlike the newer ones. The Apple Pencil costs around $130.</p>
<p>The new iPads are expected to be available sometime before the holidays. November 7th to be precise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">Apple event that&#8217;s going to happen on 30 October.</a> Much speculation has been circulating on the web regarding what Apple might unveil next. Several rumors have hinted a few Mac products coming our way including MacBook, iMac, iPad Pro, and an Apple Watch too.</p>
<h2>Apple has registered to sell new devices</h2>
<p>Just when we thought we had the fall event figured out, a new report has resurfaced. According to<a href="https://consomac.fr/news-9503-apple-depose-ses-nouveaux-macs-doctobre-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> a filing at the Eurasian Economic Commission&#8217;s product registry</a>, Apple has requested permission to sell new computers. If you are unaware of the term EEC, it is an organization that regulates and approves the marketing of electronic products on the Eurasian Economic Union grounds.</p>
<p>The filing has been translated from French from the website and includes a few macOS 10.14 running Macs. A series of macOS 10.14 MacBooks were also listed, among which the A1932 model has been found in prior listings too. We are sure that its a laptop model code. However, the only new entries in the list are A1993, A2115, and A2116. This means we can expect at least three new Apple products to be unveiled on October 30.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to another report, a K-12 education order for some Mac products placed recently by a customer was delayed. The order included a MacBook Air, iPad and Apple Pencil out of which only the iPad and Apple Pencil were received. The shipment of MacBook Air was delayed by Apple to 30 October, which sounds far from a coincidence.</p>
<p>Reminiscing to the predictions made by the supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the upcoming MacBook could be a replacement for the existing MacBook Air. The said device is to feature a 13-inch Retina display, replacing the nebulous and outdated display of the MacBook Air. It is also predicted to be embedded with Intel&#8217;s latest 9th generation chipset. To top it off, the entire package will be wrapped with a $1200 worth of bow. On another bright note, we&#8217;d be getting the older MacBook model for just $999.</p>
<p>But, there is still so much that we can presume at the moment. In just 5 more days we&#8217;d have all the answers about the MacBook upgrades that we have been giddily waiting for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more in the making&#8221; is what Apple is tag lining their upcoming event with. This &#8216;sort of&#8217; teaser has sparked a lot of excitement among Apple lovers. The company has already held a gigantic and successful Apple event a little over a month ago in which they released their latest iPhones and Apple Watch. Seems like Apple isn&#8217;t planning on going out of the spotlight anytime soon.</p>
<p>The date Apple has set for Apple’s <a title="Apple Event" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent fall event</a> is October 30, taking place at the <a href="https://www.bam.org/about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Howard Gilman Opera House </a>in New York City. That&#8217;s right, the venue is different too unlike the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino where they held their previous event in September.</p>
<p>Although, this is not a complete surprise. There have been rumors about the<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-hold-us-ipad-pro-2018/"> iPad revamp</a> since forever and was long overdue as well. It only made sense that Apple would come around this year work on their abandoned tablet series that hadn&#8217;t received a major update since over a year. Apart from the iPad Pro (the most certain unveiling), there are a few more innovations that we are expecting to be a part of this event.</p>
<h3>What could be &#8216;in the making&#8217;?</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s our take on what Apple users should be expecting in the 30 Oct reveal.</p>
<h4>The iPad Pro (of course)</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4282" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/https_2F2Fblogs-images.forbes.com2Fdavidphelan2Ffiles2F20182F092FiPad-Pro-12-9-2018-5K1-1068x580.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="298" /></p>
<p>We are expecting a dual iPad Pro reveal from Apple to make up for the lost time. The 11-inch size and a redesigned 12.9-inch size iPad. The size variety may come with the introduction to Face ID, USB C port, and a notch less design but with the loss of Touch ID and Smart Connector.</p>
<h4>The MacBook</h4>
<p>The 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pros were updated back in July without any formal event. Nonetheless, we do expect at least 1 major <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/macbook-air-upgrade-apple-fall-event/">MacBook update</a> to be a part of their fall get together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>We think that Apple might replace their customary 12-inch MacBook with a 13-inch version. According to past resurfaced reports, the company is aiming at keeping the range between $1000-$1500  with the inclusion of Touch ID and the exclusion of Touch Bar.</p>
<h4>The iMac</h4>
<p>The new hardware of the improved iMac is said to have “significant display-performance upgrades”.</p>
<p>According to past rumors, the MacBook Pro might include the True Tone display support. This allows an adjustment to the color temperature based on lighting ambiance, although it’s still debatable if it only refers to True Tone on the iMac.</p>
<h4>The Mac mini</h4>
<p>Among all outdated Apple devices, the Mac mini certainly takes the cake. Still possessing the 2014 hardware, the Mac mini could be bumped up majorly according to rumors that were circulated in August 2018.</p>
<p>Apple will be focusing on facilitating the needs of Pro users in their 2018 refresh according to Mark Gurman and Debby Wu. Like every other Apple upgrade, higher specs mean higher prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is also planning the first upgrade to the Mac mini in about four years. It’s a Mac desktop that doesn’t include a screen, keyboard, or mouse in the box and costs $500. The computer has been favored because of its lower price, and it’s popular with app developers, those running home media centers, and server farm managers. For this year’s model, Apple is focusing primarily on these pro users, and new storage and processor options are likely to make it more expensive than previous versions, the people said.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The AirPods and AirPower</h4>
<p>Techies are expecting Apple to come forward with their previously announced AirPower wireless charging pad and the wireless charging case for AirPods earphones.</p>
<p>The company teased the reveal in September with an updated version of AirPods including Hey Siri support before the event. The products were surprisingly not mentioned in the following event and yet remain to be seen.</p>
<h4>The OS updates</h4>
<p>Apple might grab the opportunity to release details about their latest OS updates that have been in Beta testing since September. Yes, we are expecting the debut of the iOS 12.1 and the macOS 10.14.1.</p>
<p>With these updates, Apple might release the long-awaited multi-caller Group Face time feature and audio chats. This, along with the support for dual SIM functionality that is going to enable the Series 4’s EKG functionality.</p>
<p>The watchOS may too be getting ahead and include the  ECG support for U.S. Apple Watch users.</p>
