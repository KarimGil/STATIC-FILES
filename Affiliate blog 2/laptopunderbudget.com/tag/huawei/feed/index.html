										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all remember last year at MWC 18 when Huawei unveiled their flagship Matebook X Pro that blew the consumers away with a storm. To outdo themselves this time at the Mobile World Congress 19, Huawei upgraded their already popular Matebook X Pro and also introduced a bigger (but not better) Matebook 14.</p>
<p>We believe that Huawei perfected the formula  of an ideal &#8211; good performance machine to a level that they didn&#8217;t want to fiddle much with it. So with the new Matebook X Pro, there are definitely configuration refreshes but the design, port selection and overall look and feel of the device remain the same. So, we’re left with two USB-C ports and one USB-C connector but with full Thunderbolt functionality. However, we do see a taller screen ratio than the last year on the Matebook X Pro which has improved its usability for scrolling and web surfing.</p>
<p>There is a selection of configurations you can opt for ofcourse. But the entry level MateBook X Pro will ship with an 8th generation Intel Core i5-8265U processor (going up to Core i7s for higher models). An Intel UHD Graphics 620, 8GB (going up to 16 GB) of DDR3 memory and a 256GB SSD (options going up to 1 TB). If you are feeling more adventurous and want to kick things up a notch, you can also throw in an NVIDIA GeForce MX250 graphics.</p>
<p>The most dramatic trend in 2019 is slim bezeled laptops. The Matebook X Pro holds a 13.9-inch display, working out a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. Yeap, I know what you are thinking, the webcam is (yet again) tucked under the keyboard making video conferences a bit awkward.</p>
<p>The aluminum body color options available for the Matebok X Pro are “Mystic Silver” and “Space Gray,” measuring only 0.57 inches in width and weighing only 2.93 lbs. There is also a fingerprint sensor within the power button for haptic login via Windows Hello.</p>
<p>Now the Matebook 14 is quite a reflection of the X Pro but only with a larger display and a bulkier body. Alongside the 14-inch screen, there is a trade between the Thunderbolt 3 port of the X Pro with a standard USB-C, an HDMI, a USB-3.0, and a USB 2.0 port. The HDMI port is sort of an unexpected treat as we can all relate with people who do NOT want to be mired in wire meshes and a dozen kind of dongles. Apart from these distinctions, it holds same keyboard, trackpad, fingerprint scanner, and embedded webcam as the pricier model. Just the quad sound system has been swapped with underside speakers on the Matebook 14.</p>

<p>The MateBook 14 is embodied in Space Gray and a lighter Mystic Silver colors as well. The specs go up to 8th generation Whiskey Lake Core i7 process, a discrete GPU (same as the X Pro), a built-in Dolby Atmos and a fingerprint sensing power button. Despite being specced almost the same, the Matebook 14 lacks the panache of the Matebook X Pro.</p>
<p>The devices are to arrive sometime in April. As per Huawei, the laptops will be boxed with a 65W charger, equipping the laptops with three hours of power backup after just 15 minutes of fast charging. The MateBook X Pro starts around $1,800, with the MateBook 14 priced from $1,360.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The roadmap that Huawei has for their MateBook lineup is to craft thin, light, elegant and powerful machines and place them at various ends of the price scale. It&#8217;s no secret that Huawei&#8217;s MateBook series is massively inspired from either MacBooks or other signature PCs. And it&#8217;s a good thing really. It provides budget users &#8211; who crave for such posh devices, an alternative with various price options.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s latest MateBook 13 serves the same purpose and is aspiring to fit into the shoes of the evergreen MacBook Air. However, it still is a better &#8211; Windows version of it. Apart from that, among the Huawei line itself, the MateBook 13 falls somewhere between the affordable MateBook D and the premium MateBook X Pro and is midway between their prices as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_5117" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5117" class="size-full wp-image-5117" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Huawei-MateBook-13.jpeg" alt="Huawei MateBook 13" width="650" height="520" /><p id="caption-attachment-5117" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Huawei</p></div>
<p>Since giants like ASUS and Acer have embraced the futuristic design of slim bezels Huawei has jumped right between the field as well with their MateBook 13. With a sleek aluminum alloy and metal body finish, the device crams narrow bezels around a display that offers 6% more screen area, according to Huawei.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/">The Best 13-inch Laptops</a></strong></p>
<p>As its a solid MacBook competitor, Huawei surely wasn&#8217;t going to cheap out on the specs. The 13-inch, 2,160&#215;1,440 IPS screen is so lit (300 nits to exact) that it will easily feel like a 15-inch wide display. The Intel Whiskey Lake 8th gen i7-8565U processor does perfect justice to the beautiful chassis of MateBook 13 and makes sure to deliver powerful CPU performance. That ofcourse, accompanied with discrete Nvidia MX150 GPU and 512 GB of storage. There is also a baser version available with an 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8265U processor, 256GB of storage, integrated graphics. But the same 8 GB RAM and two USB-C ports being packed with both versions.</p>
<p>Although the RAM is not exceptional, features like an onboard fingerprint reader and grade A Stereo Dolby Atmos speakers take the spotlight away from the little flaws.</p>
<p>The basic version of the Huawei MateBook 13 will be up for grabs from January 29 at Amazon and Newegg with prices starting from $1,000. Whereas the fancier variant will also be available but for $1,300.</p>
