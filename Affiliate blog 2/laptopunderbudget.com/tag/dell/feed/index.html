										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the XPS 13 as Dell came out with the fundamental model back in 2015. While the overall machine was great, the users criticized the notebook on its one particular trait — the placement of the webcam. There is hardly anyone out there who is not a sucker for slim bezels. But back in 2015, apparently, it meant relocating the camera to an inconvenient and unflattering position.</p>
<p>Well, it is 2019 now, and Dell has started the year by addressing this particular ailment and fixing the webcam issue. Instead of opting for a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push-open notch like ASUS</a>, Dell has worked on making the camera so tiny that you barely see it there. Dell says that they took their inspiration from the smartphones guidebook and opted the &#8216;active alignment technology,&#8217; that is a first for PC cameras.</p>
<div id="attachment_5131" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5131" class="size-full wp-image-5131" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Dell-XPS-13-9380-2019.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 9380 - 2019" width="828" height="580" /><p id="caption-attachment-5131" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>The new and improved XPS 13 (9380) was unveiled at CES 2019. Dell has made upgrades in other areas of the laptop as well, but the webcam fix remains the most mentionable one. Inside this svelte package, you will find the new 8th generation Whiskey Lake quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, with baser i5 and i3 options as well. There is also up to 16GB of memory, a 256 GB PCIe storage, and a glamorous  4K (3840 x 2160) touchscreen. You can also trade the touch display for a lower price with lower end specs.</p>

<p>Dell might have salvaged the webcam while putting slim bezels in, but there is so much they can do. Now users have to rely on the fingerprint login instead of Windows Hello, which is a small sacrifice to make for the slim and glamorous design.</p>
<p>Dell promises a much stronger, reliable and powerful performance with the specs bump and it seems believable as well, but the claim for battery standup &#8211; not so much. The XPS 13 9380 is said to deliver 21 hours of standup on a single charge, but we won&#8217;t get too carried away until the ultrabooks are put to the test properly.</p>
<p>Dell released silver-on-black and rose gold-on-white colors with 4K touch displays while the silver-on-black option with a long-awaited Full HD touch display will be available sometime in the coming months. There&#8217;s also a new frost white color option added by Dell which comes with similar fiberglass palm rest area as the rose gold color option. It will be available with full HD non-touch and 4K touch display in few weeks.</p>
<p>These futuristic-looking ultrabooks are available starting today and are already up for sale on the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/laptops/new-13-9380/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell website</a>. Prices start from $882 to $1823 with various specs and features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have forever been hearing about laptops that are slimmer, smaller, and flexible, often forgetting there is an entire line of users with quite different needs. Dell has just come around and updated their Latitude range to include sturdy laptop designs fitting those peculiar needs. These beasts are solely for industrial and military uses.</p>
<p>The laptops are able to withstand harsh atmospheres and extreme temperatures without bending or breaking. Basically, every abuse that is possible in the field that a normal computer would not be able to survive. The line is aimed at the unsung heroes like military soldiers and firefighters, also for professionals working in factories, construction sites, offshore oil-rigs, doctors and scientists in disaster-relief situations. Basically for every use that has a high probability of causing mechanical failures or has a threat of damaging delicate machinery.</p>
<h3>How is it &#8216;Rugged&#8217;?</h3>
<p>According to Dell, the reason behind choosing their Latitude line to include enterprise machines is because it is their only range that came closest to the configurations of its Rugged and Extreme laptops. The outcome is basically powerhouses, ready to bear drops, extreme temperatures, and rain. Dell is kind of hoping to corner the market with a set of buff laptops able to be reliable no matter the conditions.</p>
<p>Engineers, professionals, and army men are free to bring these into the harshest of conditions with dust, water, snow or even give it a few good bumps and drops without the fear of damaging an expensive gear. Another useful addition is the interchangeable dual batteries. They are practical in a way that a few fully charged lithium-ion batteries can be carried to the site and swapped when a charging port is not nearby which happens often on the fields.</p>
<h2>New Models and Specifications</h2>
<p>Dell&#8217;s Latitude lineup now includes the Latitude 7424 Rugged Extreme, the Latitude 5424 and 5420. These models are following up to the predecessors 5414 and 7414 models. Now, in terms of performance, the new additions models are more or less the same but do come in various hardware configurations. The new 5420, 5424, and 7424 machines boasts latest Intel 8th generation processors and durable builds. The models, however, vary in form factor, resilience and durability.</p>
<h3>The Latitude 7424 Rugged Extreme</h3>
<p>The Rugged Extreme Latitude 7424 model, for instance, is capable of handling more tough situations compared to the 5424 model. The 5420 model is about adding a hint of portability along with resilience and ruggedness than an average machine.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Rugged Extreme&#8217; takes the cake with Intel&#8217;s 8th Generation vPro processors, and a range of supported Wi-Fi connectivity. The 7424 can also be paired with a Snapdragon X20 LTE modem to maintain connectivity even in remote or outlandish areas. It poises up to 4TB of SSD storage, up to 32GB of RAM, a 51 Whr primary battery and an option to hot-swap in a second battery.</p>
<p>The screen, sized to 14-inch and anti-glare, comes with 1080p resolution and up to 1000-nits of brightness so it stays lit enough to be visible in direct sunlight.  A touch panel works with those gigantic gloves we see firemen wearing. The graphics are powered by Intel&#8217;s integrated chips &#8211; with optional AMD Radeon 540 and RX540.</p>
<div id="attachment_4436" style="width: 975px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4436" class="wp-image-4436 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-Latitude-7424-Rugged.jpg" alt="Dell Latitude 7424 Extreme Rugged Testing" width="965" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-4436" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>New Dell Latitude 7424 Rugged | Image &#8211; Dell</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The Rugged Extreme&#8217;s atmosphere withstanding capabilities are outstanding. The heavy-duty beasts are able to operate in temperatures ranging from 20 degrees below zero up to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Dell claims that this model has passed the  MIL-STD-810G testing which basically tests the resilience of a device to survive a fall of a certain degree, which here is from up to six feet.</p>
<p>Dell&#8217;s spec sheets claim the following for the 7424:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MIL-STD-810G testing:</strong> Transit drop 72&#8243;/.91m, 60&#8243;/1.52m, 48&#8243;/1.22m; single unit; 78 drops, operating drop (36&#8243;/0.91m), blowing rain, blowing dust, blowing sand, vibration, functional shock, humidity, salt fog (with rubberized keyboard), altitude, explosive atmosphere, solar radiation, thermal extremes, thermal shock, freeze/thaw, tactical standby to operational.</p>
<p><strong>Operating thermal range:</strong> -20°F to 145°F (-29°C to 63°C)</p>
<p><strong>Non-operating range:</strong> -60°F to 160°F (-51°C to 71°C)</p>
<p><strong>IEC 60529 ingress protection:</strong> IP-65 (dust-tight, protected against pressurized water)</p></blockquote>
<p>To top things off, there is a Windows Hello IR camera, and a fingerprint reader addition. Of course, if the device is intended for military and industrial usage, it has to accompany various security features to keep sensitive data safe and encrypted.</p>
<p>The assortment of ports come from USB Type-C to an RS-232 serial, a RJ45, HDMI, VGA/Display (optional), Fischer USB, and pogo-pin connectors for docking.</p>
<p>The Latitude 7424 Rugged Extreme being a little too much on the pricey end, will be available <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-7424-rugged-extreme/spd/latitude-14-7424-laptop/xctol742414us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">starting from $3,500</a>. But of course, for a premium+hardcore device, users are expected to compensate the same as well.</p>
<h3>New Latitude 5420 and 5424 Rugged</h3>
<p>Minutely &#8216;thinner&#8217; additions &#8211; the 5424 Rugged and an even slimmer, the 5420, are essentially identical to the 7424 Rugged Extreme. That is only in terms of hardware, but as for durability, they have a somewhat lower tolerance for drops (up to three feet) and weigh around 5 to 7 pounds.</p>
<div id="attachment_4440" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4440" class="wp-image-4440 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-Latitude-5420-Rugged.jpg" alt="Dell Latitude 5420 Rugged" width="661" height="438" /><p id="caption-attachment-4440" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Dell Latitude 5420 Rugged in Rain | Image &#8211; Dell</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The 5424 and 5420 can too standby difficult environments but to a lesser extent. It might not last in heavy rain and dust storm but will surely make through, vibration, minor quakes, shock, heavy humidity, dripping water, and high altitudes.</p>
<p>For 5424 and 5420, Dell claims:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MIL-STD-810G testing:</strong> Transit drop 36&#8243;/.91m; single unit; 26 drops, operating drop (36”/0.91m), blowing dust, vibration, functional shock, humidity, altitude, thermal extremes</p>
<p><strong>Operating thermal range:</strong> -20°F to 140°F (-29°C to 60°C)</p>
<p><strong>Non-operating range:</strong> -60°F to 160°F (-51°C to 71°C)</p>
<p><strong>IEC 60529 ingress protection:</strong> IP-52 (dust-protected, protected against dripping water when tilted up to 15°)</p></blockquote>
<p>All other hardware specifications are more or less the same in all three variants of the Latitude.</p>
<p>The Latitude 5424 and 5420 Rugged will be available at the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-5424-rugged/spd/latitude-14-5424-laptop/xctol542414us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">starting price of $1,500</a> and <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-5420-rugged/spd/latitude-14-5420-laptop/xctol542014us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$1,400 from Dell</a>, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you think about the perfect gaming machine, whether you are a user or not &#8211; the name Alienware comes to mind. Known for their robustness &#8211; the Dell&#8217;s Alienware series is unmatchable in terms of their gaming performance. Despite having a reputation as the &#8216;jocks&#8217; of laptops, Alienware is stepping out of its horizon. With its latest release, Alienware m15, the company has tried to make a sleeker and more compact laptop. This means that apart from being complete gaming monsters, the Alienwares will not be left out of the sleek and slim series.</p>
<p>The body of the new Alienware m15 is made from a magnesium and copper alloy. Dell claims the Alienware m15 to be the trimmest gaming machine with its sides measuring at 0.8 inch and a total weight of 4.8 pounds.</p>
<h3>The Machine</h3>
<h5>Slim design</h5>
<p>The entire structure of the laptop has been cut and clipped. The bezel is slimmer than its predecessors, the keypad has been changed to a chiclet design and keys are finer around the edges. But all this chopping off has come with a small price. Turns out that the bulkiness of the machine helped to fend off overheating. Now with a sleeker version, the chances of exhausting heat look slimmer as well.</p>
<h5>Processing</h5>
<p>Back to the good parts, the machine&#8217;s insides hold an 8th Generation Intel Core <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-core-i5-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i5-8300H</a> and <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-core-i7-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i7-8750H</a> processor. For the GPU, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 1060 OC or 1070 Max-Q are hosted in different models. It&#8217;s commendable how Dell has maintained the performance standard of Alienwares and then some. According to sources, Alienware m15 can deliver nearly 50% better gaming performance than the Alienware 13. So, the shedding of weight costs no performance loss in comparison with the older Alienware 15 laptop.</p>
<h5>Keyboard</h5>
<p>For some reason, I have always been fond of the backlit keyboard of Alienwares. They looked like the only vibrant aspect of an otherwise tank-like posture of the laptop. The device sports a new mSeries keyboard inside with dedicated numeric pad and has a 1.4mm traveling keys with individually programmable RGB backlighting.</p>
<p>The lighting option is spread across four other zones which include Alienware logo on the lid, sides and the power button. It gives complete support for the Alienware Command Center.</p>
<div id="attachment_4239" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4239" class="wp-image-4239 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/alienware-m15-launched.jpg" alt="Alienware m15 launch event image" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-4239" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Alienware m15</strong> | Image &#8211; cnet</p></div>
<h5>Ports</h5>
<p>Other than that, the Alienware hosts a generous selection of ports, spread around its sides and the back. On the machine, you&#8217;ll find an HDMI 2.0 output, a USB-C connector with Thunderbolt 3, a mini DisplayPort 1.3 jack and the power port. Giving special attention to the Alienware external GPU (eGPU), there is a dedicated port just for its connection.</p>
<h5>Standby power</h5>
<p>Another impressive factor is the battery on the new Alienware m15. The juice can last up to 17 hours on the optional 90 watt hour battery in idle state. Even 13 hours with the standard 60 watt hour battery is quite commendable. The final verdict on the battery life remains to be tested though until we review this laptop.</p>
<h3>Now about the Bucks</h3>
<p>The m15 will be available in two different color options, Nebula Red and Epic silver.</p>
<p>The Alienware m15 comes with a starting price of $1,299 which is for the most basic, yet adequately powerful version. You can however opt for impressive upgrade options in terms of battery capacity, memory, and storage. Users can load it up with a memory of up to 32GB of DDR4 (clocked at 2666 MHz), and up to two 1TB PCIe, M.2 SSD drives. About the display, the m15 will have three different variants: 1080p 144Hz IPS panel (300 nits), 1080p 60Hz IPS panel (300 nits), and 4K 60Hz IPS panel (400 nits).</p>
<p>The laptop will be available for sale on October 25, 2018. You can get yours from <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/gaming/alienware-laptops" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell</a> or other retail stores!</p>
<p>Now that Alienware is out of the chunky laptop category with more than impressive hardware specs, it is a perfect go-to <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine for gamers</a>, students, and professionals alike.</p>
