										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 has been one of our most recommended gaming laptops since it was launch in 2017. We got a revision in 2018 with some changes in internals, but it was a mere spec bump as the chassis did not see anything new. In 2019, Acer has remastered it’s best selling machine by giving it a complete design overhaul and revamped thermals which Acer claims will lead to a significant difference in the experience of an average gamer.</p>
<p>When put to the test, the new Predator Helios 300 does deliver the claims made by the company while still keeping the price near to $1000. The new design appeals a look which is more modern than ever, the spec sheet with the Core i7 9750H hexa core processor and Nvidia’s Turing graphics ticks all the checkboxes and leaves nothing more to be desired. The new cooling solution also seems to help a lot. Overall, on the performance front, Acer has delivered the no-nonsense gaming machine which every gamer always asked for.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design is the most improved aspect of this machine. The 2019 Predator Helios 300 has an entirely new blue design which calls for a breath of fresh air after years of generic red and black gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The laptop has an aluminum top surface and deck, which combined with the sturdy hinge, provide the feel of strong build quality. It does add a little bit of weight though, the laptop weighs 5.1 lbs (2.3 kg) which is not light by any means, but it is slightly lighter and slimmer than the <a title="Acer Predator Helios 300 Review (PH315-51-78NP) – Breaking Stereotypes of Budget Gaming Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-review-ph315-51/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous generation</a>. It is still on the bulkier side but in line with the competition and portable enough to carry in a backpack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5868 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-2019-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 (2019) Gaming Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="680" height="400" /></p>
<p>The design is ergonomic and minimalist. The only problem I faced was that the outline is a little angular which caused some trouble while typing and needs getting used to. Apart from that, the overall new design language by Acer was a much needed change and will be appreciated by every user.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 houses a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS display, which has a refresh rate of 144 Hz and a response time of 3ms. On-paper, the display is on par with the other <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costly gaming laptops</a> out there.</p>
<p>The thin bezels add to the clean design language that Acer is going for. The 79% screen-to-body ratio provides the laptop with a sleek and modern look. They are not super-thin, so it can house the webcam up top unlike modern ultrabooks even though nobody is going to use it because it’s only good enough for video calls as there is no Windows Hello support.</p>
<div id="attachment_5871" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-image-5871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL 1080p 144Hz Display Review" width="612" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Best Display in Sub-$1000 Gaming Laptops Category</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The color accuracy is better than average with 97% SRGB and 75% ARGB color gamut. It’s not <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect for color accurate work</a>, but more than enough for a great gaming experience. The peak brightness of the panel was recorded at 343 nits which should result in good visibility outdoors.</p>
<p>The panel does suffer from backlight bleed issues. It is not the same on all the laptops and will depend totally on luck if your panel is unusable in a worst-case scenario. Backlight bleed does not affect gaming or reading text a lot, where it’s most noticeable is movies that have black bars on the corners of the screen.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard and trackpad are the most easily underlooked parts in <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptops</a>. The keyboard on this laptop is similar on the inside as the last year’s model. Even though it looks different with the blue accents and RGB backlighting, the underlying functionality and the layout is the same for the most part.</p>
<div id="attachment_5873" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-image-5873 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Trackpad.jpg" alt="2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Trackpad Review" width="750" height="484" /><p id="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>White Backlit Keyboard with Blue Accent</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Small improvements are made to the keyboard like increased key travel distance and 4 zone RGB backlight instead of the red backlight from last year. Some lower configurations don’t have the complete customizable RGB backlighting but only a subtle white light which is still better than red.</p>
<p>The trackpad has a plastic surface; it is inferior to glass trackpads but does the job. It does not suffer any hiccups or misreads thanks to windows precision drivers. The size is also good enough. Both the trackpad and keyboard are easy to get used to, and most people will find them comfortable to use without any complaints.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The new Acer Predator Helios 300 features the same specifications as any other $1200 gaming laptop in 2019, a hexa-core i7-9750H CPU that can boost up to 4.5 GHz on a single core and 4.0 GHz on all cores, 16GB of dual-channel memory and Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics with 6GB of GDDR6 virtual memory.</p>
<p>However, the spec sheet is not where it’s at. The optimization and tuning done by Acer take this laptop one step ahead of the competition. It comes factory-undervolted, which allows the CPU to maintain boost clock while sucking less power and generating less heat as a result. The ‘Turbo’ button overclocks the GPU and runs the fans at max speed to get the most out of the machine. Acer has taken care of every small detail which allows this laptop to edge out the competition. One thing to note here is that Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti comes in a few different configurations meant for different form factor designs. The Predator Helios 300 houses a full 80W TDP configuration of the GTX 1660 Ti. It’s safe to say it is the most powerful GTX 1660 Ti laptop out there.</p>

<p>The rest of the components are pretty well balanced; there are a few storage options to choose from. You can configure the laptop on Amazon with either a 256GB or a 512GB NVMe SSD. The read and write speeds are similar to most NVMe SSDs out there. On the inside, there are 2x SODIMM memory slots, 2x M.2 drive slots and an empty 2.5-inch drive bay to add a SATA SSD or a spinning HDD of your choice. Ram, storage and WiFi card can easily be upgraded by opening only a few screws. Acer has ensured the machine is very user-friendly to upgrade and service.</p>

<p>Gaming performance is where the 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 shines; it manages to stick out from the stack of all GTX 1660 Ti laptops by beating every single one of them. The dual-channel memory helps to achieve better 1% lows, and the experience is seamless. The CPU stayed at peak boost frequency all the time while playing Battlefield V.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of competitive multiplayer titles, dropping the graphics settings a bit can help max out the fps to match the display’s 144 Hz refresh-rate which is the best way to enjoy these titles.</p>
<h3>Thermals &amp; Acoustics</h3>
<p>The two fans, one dedicated to the CPU and GPU each, exhaust air out of the four vents, two on the rear, and two on the sides. Acer has done a great job of keeping this laptop cool by pre-undervolting the CPU. Under full load, the keyboard deck stays under a manageable 50°C. The CPU temperature reached a high of 85°C, and the GPU touched a max of 70°C. These temperatures are easily manageable, and no thermal throttling or power limit throttling was noticed. The testing was done with an ambient temperature of 22°C, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<div id="attachment_5874" style="width: 667px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-image-5874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3D-Aero-Blade-Fans-on-2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="New 3D Aero Blade Fans on 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop" width="657" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Improved 4th Gen 3D Aero Blade Fans for Better Airflow</strong></em></p></div>
<p>If you’re doing any CPU-heavy tasks on this laptop, you’re going to see the best results with the Turbo profile that can be initiated with the Turbo button on the deck. It automatically sets the optimum clock speed for the GPU and provides the CPU 25% more power to work with. It does increase the fan noise to slightly uncomfortable 55dB as it ramps up the fans to max speed. But that’s a sacrifice you’re going to have to make to maximize performance. It’s unnoticeable when you have headphones on.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>On the left, the laptop features a Kensington lock, power connector, an RJ45 ethernet jack, 2x USB 3.1 ports, and a combo headphone jack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5876 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Gaming Laptop Ports and Slots" width="708" height="602" /></p>
<p>On the right, we see a full-size HDMI port, a mini DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.1 port, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port.</p>
<p>The only thing missing here is an SD card slot, which is a bummer for <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative professionals</a> who use SD cards to transfer data to and from cameras. The type-c port, sadly, does not support Thunderbolt 3.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery on this laptop is a 58 Wh unit. Battery backup was recorded at 3-3.5 hours while doing normal tasks like browsing and watching a video with screen brightness at 250 nits and using Nvidia Optimus to force use the integrated Intel graphics. Under load, while gaming or doing any heavy tasks, don’t expect more than 45 minutes of juice out of the small battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5882 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-PH315-52-78VL-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Review - best gaming laptop in $1000 price range" width="628" height="500" /></p>
<p>The 180W AC adapter is fairly large but can be easily managed in a backpack. It adds some weight making the package about 6.1 lbs (2.8 kg) heavy to carry around.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>For $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 provides amazing value when compared to the competition. Not only does this machine outperform every <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other similarly priced laptop</a>, it does so without any compromises. With the out of the box CPU undervolt, Acer has knocked this one out of the park.</p>
<p>The balanced specifications on this laptop make it a good buy for gamers and content creators. It has a good screen, a stellar keyboard, can be easily upgraded, provides excellent gaming performance, and stays cool while doing so. The price drops to below $1100 often, and in the Black Friday sale, it dropped to a lowest of $930, which makes the Predator Helios 300 the best bang for the buck gaming laptop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all-new Acer ConceptD laptops are what happens when Acer takes all of their expertise in creating gaming laptops and turns them into something designed specifically for video editors, illustrators, and creators, as well as to take on Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Apple has had a fairly sizable share of the creator market for years with their MacBook and MacBook Pro. However, it&#8217;s also no secret that more and more creators are starting to look towards cheaper, Windows alternatives. The market is already starting to respond, but there just aren&#8217;t that many alternatives yet. Consider the Acer ConceptD laptops as the latest and one of the best in the growing line of reasons why creators should switch over to Windows and eschew Apple starting today.</p>
<p>Acer announced their new brand, ConceptD, earlier on April 11, Thursday, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Acer ConceptD laptops will initially come in three variants, each designed to help position the company to give creators a viable Windows alternative to the MacBook Pro at various price points.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Acer ConceptD Laptops</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5481 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-ConceptD-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Acer ConceptD Laptops" width="1200" height="792" />The ConceptD 9 is the flagship of Acer&#8217;s latest line. Acer claims that they designed it specifically for drawing and 3D work. To this end, they equipped the Concept D 9 with a convertible 17-inch 4K display. Not only that, but the display is also Pantone validated and has a near-perfect &lt;1 Delta-E accuracy rating for maximum color accuracy. The display also uses the same Ezel Aero Hinge as that of the Predator Triton 900 and comes with built-in support for Wacom pen.</p>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0N4Y1-G1zU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Under the hood, the ConceptD 9 comes equipped with a latest ninth-generation Intel Core i9 CPU, an RTX 2080 GPU, as well as support for up 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage space. For modern accessibility, Acer equipped the ConceptD 9 with Thunderbolt 3, USB Type-C and DisplayPort 1.4 ports.</p>
<p>The ConceptD 9&#8217;s smaller brother, the ConceptD 7, is a bit smaller. It sports a 15.6-inch 4K display and &#8220;only&#8221; comes with up to a Core i7 processor. You can also choose to have it with an RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU or the RTX 2060. The ConceptD 7 also doesn&#8217;t have the same convertible screen as the flagship of the line, nor the same pen support. However, it does come with the same storage and RAM options, making it a more traditional and more affordable laptop alternative.</p>
<p>Finally, the ConceptD 5 is the least powerful of the three. It still has the same 15.6-inch 4K panel as that of the ConceptD 7. However, underneath, it&#8217;s a bit slower, albeit still capable, with 8th-Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors powering it, along with the AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPU. Both RAM, as well as storage options, are also limited for the ConceptD5 compared to the ConceptD 7 and Concept D9. But, if it&#8217;s any consolation, the Concept D5 is the smallest and lightest of all the Acer ConceptD laptops.</p>
<h3>When Are the Acer ConceptD Laptops Going to Release?</h3>
<p>The Acer ConceptD 5 and ConceptD 7 will start selling as early as later this month of April. The former will start selling at a $1,699 price point, while the latter will set users back at least $2,299. The more powerful Acer ConceptD 9 is not set to launch until later on in June. The flagship product of the new line will start selling at a $4,999 price point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer gaming laptops, specifically, the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7, will both receive hardware and design updates once their latest versions release later this year.</p>
<p>This was confirmed on Thursday, April 11, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Nitro series line of gaming laptops are part of Acer&#8217;s effort to tap into the more budget-conscious side of the gaming laptop market. As per Acer General Manager of Notebooks, James Lin, the Nitro series Acer gaming laptops are proof that &#8220;performance gaming doesn&#8217;t need to break the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>True to that, the Acer Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 come at very affordable price points. However, they have an interesting set of features, both in terms of design and hardware. Even though there are slight compromises, the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 present themselves as budget-friendly alternatives with commendable specifications.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New in the 2019 Acer Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 Gaming Laptops?</h3>
<p>Of the two Acer gaming laptops, the Nitro 7 is more noteworthy.  It is actually a new product, not a revamp. It features a metal chassis, which belies its &#8220;affordable&#8221; nature and measures just 19.9mm thin. More importantly, it also comes equipped with a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a refresh rate of 144Hz and a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Nitro 7 is aimed for hardcore gamers on the go. Specifically, it&#8217;s made for those who love playing FPS titles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Nitro 5 is the one that&#8217;s actually a refresh of the older line. It is also the cheaper of the two Acer gaming laptops. It comes with two types of displays. You can either choose a 15.6-inch display or a 17.3-inch display. Regardless, both will come with an increased screen-to-body ratio of 80 percent. This means that the display bezels of the new Nitro 5 (as well as that of the Nitro 7) are a lot narrower compared to the older versions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5468 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" />Outside of the fact that both Acer gaming laptops come available with up to 9th-generation Intel Core processors and the latest Nvidia graphics cards, other important features include expansive storage options, including a dedicated HDD slot and two M.2 SSD slots, as well as support for up to 32GB DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>Both the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 will also come with the &#8220;CoolBoost&#8221; feature, a dual-fan cooling design that allows the laptops to keep temperatures low during intense gaming sessions. Both also feature a Killer Ethernet E2500 networking card. Additionally, you can also use the Network Optimizer Tool by Acer to further minimize latency issues when gaming online.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to the Acer Predator Helios 700</h3>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgWq9jsmNiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The creme of the crop when it comes to Acer gaming laptops, the latest Acer Predator Helios 700 puts the Taiwan-based manufacturer right at the forefront of risque innovations in the high-end, desktop-replacement, gaming laptop niche.</p>
<p>As expected, the top of the line Acer Predator Helios 700 will feature high-end hardware components. This includes an overclockable 9th-gen Intel Core i9 CPU, as well as the regular Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU and not the toned down Max-Q version, as well as support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, however.</p>
<p>The Acer Predator Helios 700 also features a transforming keyboard and trackpad that you can slide forward to help improve ventilation, which can come in quite handy if you&#8217;re trying to squeeze even more performance out of the Acer Predator Helios 700 by overclocking its hardware. The said keyboard also comes packed with MagForce keys, as well as linear switches, in addition to the requisite RGB lighting. This helps create an optimal typing and gaming experience.</p>
<p>For those who think that the Acer Predator Helios 700 is a bit too much, the smaller Acer Predator Helios 300 is also available. The latest version retains the look of its predecessor, but it comes with improved internals.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;#1 gaming notebook&#8221; comes equipped with a 144Hz display that has a 3ms response time. It can come up with up to an RTX 2080 GPU, a 9th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, as well as 32GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
<h3>When Are the New Acer Gaming Laptops Going to be Available?</h3>
<p>For those interested, it is already possible to buy the Acer Nitro 7 in the United States. It starts selling at a $1,000 price point. Acer plans on shipping Nitro 7 units out to the China and EMEA regions sometime in May and June. Meanwhile, for the Acer Nitro 5, it will arrive in US shores starting later this month of April. It will start selling for $800. The Nitro 5 should start making an appearance in the China and EMEA regions in May 2019.</p>
<p>As for the Acer Predator Helios 700, it will start selling at a $2,699 price point. The smaller Acer Predator Helios 300 is a bit more affordable at $1,199. Both should be available in April in the United States. However, the Acer Predator Helios 300 will only start selling in Europe in June, with the Helios 700 coming later in July.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are well aware of Acer&#8217;s TravelMate X3410&#8217;s popularity. Lauded largely for its affordable price, portability and its compatibility with business users. Now just after a couple of months, Acer has come up with its upgraded model &#8211; the Acer TravelMate X514-51. The company has been referring the latest release as their &#8220;lightest and thinnest professional notebook&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>Acer is rooting for this laptop to appeal to travelers and, business professionals. The category of users who are always on their feet, hence their emphasis on it being the lightest and thinnest notebook.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>
<p>Well, technically the TravelMate X514-51 comes with the same thickness as the TravelMate X3410 but is &#8216;lighter&#8217; in a sense that it weighs just 2.1 pounds vs. the 3.7 pounds X3410. The chopped of pounds ultimately means losing a few key features as well, which in this case is the full-sized SD reader and legacy VGA port.</p>
<p>The TravelMate X514-51 boasts a magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminum alloy chassis which makes it possible for durability and portability to coexist. However, do not be fooled by its spindly body as even with a small form factor, Acer has managed to pack it with a fair amount of power.</p>
<p>Inside this Windows 10 laptop, you will find up to 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processors, up to 512GB of SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM with a 14-inch FHD 1080p touch display. There is also a backlit keyboard, a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello alongside a 720p webcam. Acer claims that apart from the TravelMate being light on the body and hefty on the specs, the laptop can give up to 10 hours of battery backup. Of course, it sounds highly unlikely, but we can&#8217;t be certain until we actually review the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_5393" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-image-5393 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Acer-TravelMate-X5-2019.jpg" alt="Acer TravelMate X5 - 2019" width="857" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer TravelMate X5</strong> | Image &#8211; Acer</em></p></div>
<p>What we felt they left out of the equation was any mention of Nvidia or AMD GPU options and port selection. Some of the things the manufacturer let go of while building the small form factor of the machine we suspect. However, we do see a USB Type-A port in the pictures of the laptop which I assume is essential in business laptops.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>A little pricier than the TravelMate X3410, the TravelMate X514-51 will be rolled out in June, starting at $1,099.99. This price will buy you a Core i5, 8GB DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can always bump it up with a Core i7, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM, and up to a 512GB SSD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right after HP and a bunch of other tech vendors, Acer has upped their game for their budget Chromebooks lineup and announced the Chromebook 512 and Chromebook Spin 512 at the 2019 BETT Show in <span class="xn-location">London</span>. Chromebooks are usually categorized in the &#8216;student-friendly&#8217; category. It is due to the affordability and the sturdiness that the Chrome OS based notebooks are usually built with.</p>
<p>But to get one step ahead, Acer threw in a Windows based option as well in their educational lineup. The TravelMate B114-21.</p>
<h3>Acer Chromebook Spin 512 and Acer Chromebook 512</h3>
<p>Both Chromebooks have IPS displays of 12-inches and 1366 x 912 resolution. There is however, the choice for a convertible or a non-convertible version. And as obvious with the name, the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 features a 360-degree hinge. The hinge along with the Gorilla Glass antimicrobial coating, enables four different usage modes. A tablet mode for mostly reading, notebook mode for writing and sketching, display mode for getting a clearer view of the screen, and a tent mode for presentations, editing and collaborating.</p>
<p>Another treat is the included Wacom electro-magnetic resonance (EMR) stylus. For its placement, there is dock embedded in the notebook&#8217;s body itself. Sounds pretty chic for a budget notebook, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 512 comes with an amazing 8 MP world facing HDR webcam, with auto-focus and an 88-degree wide-FOV.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5233 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Chromebook-spin-512.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="363" /></p>
<p>Both Chromebooks deliver an exceptional battery backup, ranging up to 12 hours that means day and night support for students for at least a couple of days.</p>
<p>Not only are these notebooks extremely elegant, interactive and cheap but also come with military grade robustness. These babies can withstand drops from a 4 ft height and can handle up to 60 kg (132 pounds) of exerted force. All possible due to the strengthened design and shock-absorbing bumper.</p>
<p>Another unique factor of these laptops is that they meet two major toy safety standards and have been declared safe for use for kids. This might be credited to its moisture resistant touchpad and spill-resistant keyboard. It drains any liquid out of the bottom of the chassis, providing protection to the internal components.</p>
<p>For the configurations, Acer has loaded these notebooks with an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 processor, an 8GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage, with lower configuration options also available.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5236 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/acer_chromebook-512.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="297" />Acer has priced both these notebooks for under $500 which is affordable enough for struggling students and for parents supporting them. The Acer Chromebook Spin 512 starts at $449.99 and the Acer Chromebook 512 comes in at $329.99 with their availability expected around April.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA Laptop Review – The Best Cheap Notebook?" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-1-2018-a114-32-c1ya-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer Aspire 1 Review &#8211; The Best Cheap Notebook?</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>TravelMate B114-21</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5234 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Travelmate-B114-21.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="396" />Now its quite understandable for techies to disregard Chromebooks completely no matter how flashy they might be. Considering the instability of Chrome OS with certain apps and its limitations. To cater such users, Acer also released a Windows-based, budget learning companion for students.</p>
<p>Now what makes this notebook categorized under &#8216;educational&#8217;, is its S mode feature. The laptop&#8217;s configurations go up to a 7th Gen AMD A6-9220C processor with integrated Radeon R5 graphics, 16GB of RAM for efficient multitasking and a fast 256GB SSD storage. These combined, ensure powerful support for learning activities and some decent softwares. It also features a generous selection of ports. Including 1 x USB 3.1 port, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a memory card reader, an Ethernet port and an HDMI 2.0 port. However, it misses out on the USB Type-C port.</p>
<p>What Acer has kept uniform among this educational lineup release is the military grade strength of the machine. And yes of-course the affordable price tag. Compliant with the tough U.S. Military Standard MIL-STD 810G, the TravelMate sports a rugged rubber bumper with a shock resistant body. These altogether make the laptop resilient to almost all kinds of bumps, and hits. It can also handle drops from up to 122 cms. It&#8217;s good to see that despite the cheap cost, Acer has added a 14-inch FHD display, and a 180-degree hinge to this laptop&#8217;s specs.</p>
<p>Acer claims that the TravelMate will offer up to almost 10 hours of battery backup, coming quite close to the Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Acer has priced TravelMate for around $320 and is expected to release it for purchase by mid-year 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After CES 2019, it seems like slim notebooks with razor-thin bezels are the new trendsetters in the laptop market. Just like <a title="ASUS has just added a notebook with the ‘world’s slimmest bezels’ to its ZenBook line" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASUS ZenBooks</a>, Acer has also taken it upon themselves to add new, upgraded and slim bezeled notebooks to their already successful lineups.</p>
<p>Their renewed version of the Acer Swift 7 &#8211; already lauded for its slim build and portability, was unveiled at CES 2019. The new model known as the SF714-52T, takes off almost a third of a pound off of the previous Swift 7’s package. Due to its narrow frame, the bezels have shrunk to an unbelievable extent creating a wider, more engaging display. More on the design side, Acer claims the laptop&#8217;s body weight to be just 890 grams and just 9.9mm in thickness. And ofcourse, there is a 14-inch full HD touch Cornilla glass display with a fully immersive experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">With just 92 percent screen-to-body ratio, the latest Acer Swift 7 features an 8th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, 256GB or 512GB SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM. </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Acer promises a boost in the performance as well, highlighting their addition of the “Amber Lake” Intel Core processor. Acer prides their new invention for its compactness and the fact that the size does not arbitrate its productivity. A clear precedent is the inclusion of two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, and 3.5mm headphone jack all on its trim body. And even then, the device is so lightweight that it feels &#8216;barely there&#8217;. Moreover, Acer has promised the optimal performance with all-day battery life, lasting up to 10 hours on a single charge.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5018 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/acerswift72019.jpg" alt="Acer's Refreshed Swift 7 - CES 2019" width="580" height="358" /></p>
<p>But the upgrade that Swift users had desperately been waiting for is yet to be told. That&#8217;s right, the clickable touchpad. It was annoying and frustrating to use the tap to click method which gladly has now been eliminated thanks to this addition.</p>
<p>Now the only concern with slim bezels is the placement of webcams. That&#8217;s where the creativity really unfolds and shows how much thought designers have put into it. Not only did Acer add an HDR camera but also incorporated a push to open mechanism. Which not only is the best solution but also prevents unintended webcam usage which is a huge privacy invasion these days.</p>
<p>All these niceties are beautifully wrapped up inside what Acer calls a “micro-arc oxidation finish”. This gives the machine a ceramic-like look, available either in “Starfield Black” or “Moonstone White” themes.</p>
<p>While the upgraded version of the Acer Swift 7 is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor, it is delightful and also surprising to see that the upgrades have little impact on the costing. The new 2019 Swift 7 SF714-52T is to be priced around $1,699 which is almost the same as its previous version and will be available by May in the US.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has just announced its first Chromebook that is based on the AMD A-series processor that feature Radeon graphics. Acer is well-known for introducing very competitive Chromebooks in the past, and now Acer is adding AMD powered devices to the portfolio with the Acer Chromebook 315, which will give customers more flexibility.</p>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 315 will be powered by the entry-level 7th Gen AMD A6-9220C or A4-9120C processors, which come with Radeon graphics. The chips allow the user to have multiple tabs open and enables better multi-tasking with the help of superior performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4977 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer_Chromebook_315_06_575px.jpg" alt="AMD A-Series Processor Powered Chromebook" width="678" height="422" /></p>
<p>The Chromebook also comes with a Full HD 15.6-inch IPS display and you can choose the touchscreen option if that is what you are interested in. The company claims that the Chromebook will be able to last up to 10 hours on a single charge which is very impressive indeed, but these numbers are under particular conditions. I am guessing that with proper use, it will be able to deliver 7-8 hours which is still pretty decent.</p>
<p>It has two front-facing speakers, which should sound great. Speakers should always be front facing but this is not a feature that we see in most laptops, and I think that companies should do something about it. This is a pretty big device, so you get a full backlit keyboard too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4975 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer_Chromebook_315_02_575px.jpg" alt="AMD A-Series Processor Powered Chromebook" width="678" height="479" /></p>
<p>The device comes with two USB Type-C Gen 1 ports, but if you have older peripherals, then you need not worry as the Chromebook also has two USB 3.0 ports. You also have the headphone jack, support for WiFi 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth 4.2.</p>
<p>The Chromebook 315 will come with 8 GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It is expected to release in February, and the pricing starts at $279.99.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the Acer Chromebook 315 and whether or not this is something that you might be interested in getting for yourself.</p>

It is a competitively priced entry-level laptop from Acer which does not pack much power, but if all you need to do is browse the internet, work on documents and consume content online, this laptop can check all those boxes, and it will not break the bank while doing that.</p>
<p>Here we are going to have an in-depth look at the Acer Aspire 1 (A114-32-C1YA). I will be going through different aspects of the device, talking about the pros and cons as well as the things that I personally liked or disliked during my time with this laptop.</p>

<p>As you can see in the specs, the Acer Aspire 1 is powered by the Intel Celeron N4000 dual-core processor, which is based on Gemini Lake. The CPU has a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz and can boost to 2.6 GHz. The chip also comes with 4 MB of L2 cache. This is the same CPU that you get in the HP Stream 14. Other than that, you get 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>With that said, let&#8217;s begin with our review of Acer Aspire 1, talking about each aspect of the laptop, one by one.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 is an entry-level laptop from Acer, so there isn&#8217;t really anything fancy about the design but it is still a robust machine, and overall it is very clean. The exterior of the laptop looks stylish, especially the brushed aluminum finish on the lid with silver Acer logo in the center. On opening the lid, you&#8217;ll find the same finish around the keyboard and touchpad area as well. While there is nothing to brag about the design of this laptop, it manages not to look cheap.</p>
<div id="attachment_4885" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-image-4885 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Textured-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Textured Lid" width="700" height="525" /><p id="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Brushed Aluminum Finish on the Lid</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, there are certain design flaws on this laptop, and one of them is its bad speaker placement. The laptop has two speakers at the bottom, one on either side, and its poor placement muffled the sound everytime I used the laptop from my lap. If we talk about the sound quality, then it isn&#8217;t that great either. Its two speakers do get loud enough to fill the small-sized room, but I felt a lack of clarity while listening to music. But, considering that this is a $200 laptop, some sacrifice needed to be made, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Talking about the internal design, getting to the internals of this laptop was very hard. I had to open fifteen screws and had to pull the back panel off to gain access to the parts, but that&#8217;s fine because there are no upgradable parts inside the laptop. The RAM and storage drive is soldered on the motherboard, and that makes users stuck with its low 4GB of RAM which kind of bottlenecks its overall performance (more on this later). Moreover, the internal design is fanless so you won&#8217;t be hearing any fan noise when you use the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_4886" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-image-4886 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Internal-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Internal Design" width="667" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Internal Design | RAM Soldered on Motherboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall the Acer Aspire 1 has decent build quality. The materials used do not feel like this is an entry-level device. The texture on the lid adds to the premiums of the laptop, and the laptop not only looks impressive but feels great as well. The device is pretty light, and you can easily take it with you.</p>

<h4>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h4>
<p>There are a couple of useful ports on this laptop that make it great for the price. You get an ethernet port that will allow you to plug in an ethernet cable if you want faster internet speeds and do not want to rely on a wireless connection. You also have an HDMI output port that will deliver 4K at 30 FPS. On the left, you have a USB 3.0 port to transfer data faster. You also get an SD card slot, but the card sticks out which can be an issue if you were looking to expand laptop&#8217;s limited storage with the SD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4887" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Left-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Left Side Ports" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you have the combo jack for headphones and two more USB 2.0 ports. These are slower ports that can be used to connect a mouse or other devices that do not require higher throughput.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Right-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="382" /></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you will be able to take advantage of high-speed internet and routers that use 5 GHz frequencies. The laptop also offers Bluetooth 4.1 which can be used to connect wireless devices like a mouse or a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display on the Aspire 1 is a 14-inch TN panel which does not offer great viewing angles, and as expected it isn&#8217;t color accurate either. The bright side is that while the screen is the same size as the HP Stream 14, it has a higher resolution. That said, the Acer Aspire 1 is the only laptop in this price segment to offer full HD display making it the perfect budget option for binge watchers.</p>
<div id="attachment_4890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-image-4890 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 - Display Review" width="800" height="637" /><p id="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>14-inch Full HD Matte Display</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The screen is a bit dim, but it has a matte coating on top which does a great job of reducing reflections while using this laptop in well-lit areas. Overall, it is a pretty decent panel keeping in mind that this laptop costs just a little <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200</a>.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature is that the screen can be rotated more than 180 degrees. The Acer Aspire 1 is in no means a 2-in-1 device, so I do not really know what Acer is trying to do with this feature, but you can have the screen flat on a surface if you want. The hinge does have a bit of range, and that might keep the screen from snapping off.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Keyboard And Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard on the Acer Aspire 1 is very impressive, the keys have ample travel, and they are decent to type on. The keys are also a bit larger than usual which is great for typing. The only issue is that the placement of some keys can take a bit of getting used to. You will need to adjust to the arrangement of the small arrow keys and the buttons next to the Enter and Backspace keys. This is not a major issue, and once you have used the device for a few hours, you should get used to it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Review-Keyboard-and-Touchpad.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="750" height="590" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is much better than some previous <a title="All Acer Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> that we have used in the past, and the overall design is decent. The touchpad is not all that great though. It is a bit wobbly, but it will get the job done. It uses Windows Precision drivers and supports gestures as well. Compared to the HP Stream 14, the keyboard is fine, but the touchpad could have been better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks of Laptops for Writers with Comfortable Keyboards</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The webcam on the Aspire 1 is another thing after speakers that Acer has compromised to price it competitively. Acer has fitted a very bad webcam on this laptop which produces an unacceptable picture and video quality, even as per the budget laptop standards. The picture that I took of mine with its webcam came out entirely out of focus, grainy and with vanished colors.</p>
<p>So, if you have to make a lot of video calls everyday or attend the video conferences, then this is not the right laptop for you unless you are ready to spend a bit extra for an <a title="External Webcams on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LH16yf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">external webcam</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode which is excellent for students and individuals who need added security. For uninitiated, the S mode limits the third party apps that you can download, and you can only use apps that are verified by Microsoft and are available on the official Microsoft store. Well, if you don&#8217;t like it, opting out of the S mode is not an issue, and you can move to regular Windows 10 Home with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Software-and-Warranty-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Software and Warranty Review" width="735" height="550" /></p>
<p>Along with Window 10, there are a couple of other apps and games as well that come pre-installed. These include the Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Friends Saga, Cooking Fever, Township, Royal Revolt 2, Fitbit Coach, Photastic Collage, ACG player and Amazon. All these apps can be uninstalled, so it&#8217;s not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The laptop also comes with a free year of Office 365 and the Acer Product registration app which you will need to register your device, check the warranty and get customer support.<br />

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 is a netbook with the dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM, so I did not have high hopes when testing the device and it seems that I was right for the most part. The 4 GB of RAM is a major limitation, and it took only four Chrome tabs to get the device to slow down. With eight tabs open in Chrome and one of them playing a YouTube video, there was a noticeable lag when typing.</p>
<p>While this is not a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming machine</a>, we did play Asphalt 9 on the device, and it ran well. There was no noticeable lag, but then again, the game is very well optimized and will even run on smartphones. We also tried Cooking Fever that came pre-installed, and that ran fine as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Real-Life-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Real Life Performance" width="527" height="700" /></p>
<p>As far as thermals are concerned, the device’s bottom does get a bit warm even while normal multi-tasking possibly because of its fanless design. It can be problematic for users like me who like to use the laptop by keeping it on the lap. However, it was completely usable when kept on the table, and its keyboard and palm rest area didn’t show any signs of heat which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Acer Aspire 1 isn&#8217;t great when it comes to multitasking and although it will run games found on the official store just fine, you cannot expect to play games on it. Opening multiple apps or even Chrome tabs will slow it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>Recommended: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The claimed battery life of the 2018 Acer Aspire 1 is around 6.5 hours, and in our tests, it managed to last for 7 hours and 12 minutes which is decent, but there are options in the market that will give you 8-9 hours of battery backup. That is a factor worth considering if you are someone who has to rely a lot on battery power every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laptop took 2 hours and 17 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% which is also a little longer than the other laptops. So, the battery on the Acer Aspire 1 takes its time to charge and does not offer much in terms of battery life either.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Under $200 &#8211; Our Most Recommended Inexpensive Laptops</a></strong></em> </div></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Laptop-Review-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Laptop Review - Featured Image" width="650" height="483" /></p>
<p>One of the strongest points of the Acer Aspire 1 is its 14-inch full HD display which makes hard to find a substitute for this laptop. Moreover, it offers plenty of ports and comes with modern wireless connectivity options so that you can take advantage of high-speed internet and connect your wireless devices. Although its speakers lack in clarity and have an awful webcam, one cannot go wrong with it considering it costs just $250.</p>
<p>So, overall the Acer Aspire 1 is a solid laptop for the price if you consume content online or work with documents. It can handle some mobile games that are available on the Microsoft store and is a well-built machine overall. The storage and RAM are the limiting factors, but if all you need is a device on which you can create documents, browse the web and watch movies, then this is one of the best inexpensive laptops right now that will get the job done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer is one such company, which has made its name and fame in the gaming laptop segment. The company has been launching powerful gaming laptops in various segments at various price points. Acer’s Predator series of laptops are globally reputed for their performance and power.</p>
<p>With the company launching multiple devices in the gaming laptop market such as the beastly Predator 21X and the sleek and stylish Predator Triton 700, the company has recently updated their already well-known Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop. The 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is a very straightforward, powerful, and no-nonsense gaming laptop. The device carries a lot of USPs with it and offers an improved and powerful gaming performance for the asking price.</p>
<p>Priced at under $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 offers all the current generation hardware and the fast refresh-rate display which has made it gain rapid popularity. We spent a good amount of time with the device to test its caliber. And, here is what we think of it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design, there isn’t much of an upgrade here. Having said that, the 2018 Helios 300 looks exactly identical to the last year’s model.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Helios 300 at the very first glance looks to be much thinner and compact than that of the other laptops in the segment. However, when you hold the device and start using it, you’ll realize that it, in fact, is on a bulkier side. The device comes with a dimension of 10.47 x 15.35 x 1.05 inches, which is a little wider and thicker for a 15-inch laptop. The device weighs slightly over 5.5 pounds and can be quite cumbersome to carry around. However, considering the fact that it is a gaming laptop and has a lot of engineering within, it might not be an issue for most of us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Design" width="650" height="406" /></p>
<p>Acer this time has come up with newer color variants, to give gamers a choice. It has unveiled the special edition Acer Predator Helios 300, which comes clad in a white-and-gold chassis. However, we still don&#8217;t know when it will hit the stores.</p>
<p>The one which we tested looks just like its predecessor and has the same angular design going all around with red and black color scheme. Its aluminum lid has a huge Predator logo and a red lining on either side which gives it a proper gaming hue, however, it doesn&#8217;t light up like Alienware and some <a title="All MSI Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/msi-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end MSI laptops</a>.</p>
<p>Most gamers would love the design of this laptop, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an out of the box gaming laptop design, then the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) might not please you that much.</p>
<div id="attachment_3941" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Lid-design.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 - Lid design" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Premium looking Metal Lid with Huge Predator Logo and Red Lines on Either Side</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the build quality, there is a lot of plastic used in the making of chassis of this laptop. However, there are no compromises with the build quality and laptop feels very solid to hold. Moreover, it comes with a pretty ergonomic form-factor making it subtle to carry around and use.</p>
<p>As far as ports and slots are concerned, they are neatly recessed on both sides of the laptop and they are smartly placed in a way that wired gaming mouse won&#8217;t hinder your gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Almost all the Acer Predator series of laptops come with a short-stroke keyboard, which might not often be preferred for gaming. The keys on the Helios 300, comes with a travel of the only 1.2mm into the frame on a press, which is not much. This affects the tactile feedback on the keyboard. However, this doesn’t hold true for regular usage including documents editing and other general tasks.</p>
<p>However, the gamers will like the keys on the device as they are very brightly backlit and come in non-changeable red color hue to match the styling. The keys come with a slight curve, which adds on to the typing experience nonetheless.</p>
<div id="attachment_3943" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3943" class="wp-image-3943 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="800" height="491" /><p id="caption-attachment-3943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong><em>Iron Red Backlit Keyboard with 1.2mm Key Travel</em></strong></p></div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><strong><em>You May Like to Check out: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptop for Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</em></strong></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the trackpad on the device, it is made out of plastic and evidently, one can feel that right away. Although the tactile feedback and the touch sensitivity on the trackpad are fine-tuned, we felt the lack of richness, we ought to get on gaming laptops over $1000. However, it can still take up all the everyday essentials with ease without dropping a sweat.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD widescreen display and it is an IPS LED-backlit panel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What makes it unique though is its fast 144Hz refresh rate</span>. Meaning, the rapid refresh rate shortens the time it takes for frame rendering and provides gamers with an excellent in-game experience. This helps especially when you’re gaming or watching the high-quality video files.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3946" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-PH315-51-78NP-144Hz-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP) 144Hz Display Review" width="900" height="667" /></p>
<p>The display can get bright up to 300 nits and produces a decent 70% NTSC and 90% sRGB color gamut on the scale, making it good enough for content creators. We also played some 4K content on the laptop, and the details were very precise, that we could see every minute detail played.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops for Photo Editing with Most Color Accurate Display</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Overall, the display on the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) gaming laptop is one of its unique selling points and without a doubt, it is one of the best display-equipped mid-range gaming laptop available to buy right now.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the hardware of the device, Acer Predator Helios 300 comes with powerful innards, which makes it one of the latest in the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segment of mid-range gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by a latest 8th gen Intel Core i7-8750H hexa-core processor with clock frequency of up to 4.1GHz and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 video memory. The duo of this CPU and GPU makes it one of the most powerful and value for money gaming laptops available for the asking price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops</a> (8th Gen)</strong></em></div></div>
<p>For multitasking, the laptop has a huge 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of PCIe based NVMe SSD. Although this might not be sufficient to store huge data, be mindful, the SSD storage offered in this laptop is at least 4 times faster than that of the traditional HDD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_3947" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Hardware-and-Upgradability.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-78NP Hardware and Upgradability" width="800" height="546" /><p id="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>New Dual Fan Cooling System | Easy to upgrade RAM (Up to 32GB) and Storage</strong> <em>&#8211; Image taken from Dave Lee YouTube Channel</em></p></div>
<p>To the gamers rejoice, hardware on the Predator Helios 300 is quite easy to upgrade. The laptop&#8217;s back panel gives access to its two RAM slots one of which is empty and it also has an empty storage drive bay inside to upgrade its low storage with the hard drive or another SSD. The WiFi card is also easily accessible but we don&#8217;t think it needs to be changed as the Gigabit card that the laptop comes equipped with, works flawlessly and provides excellent WiFi reception.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming stationed laptop, we expect a lot of additional peripherals to be connected to the device. Accordingly, the Helios 300 comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C port which can support speeds of up to 5GBps. It also sports a USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports. There is an HDMI 2.0 port to plug in the additional display if needed. The HDMI port available comes with HDCP support. Apart from these, it also comes with a microSD card reader, an RJ45 Ethernet port, headphone jack, and a charging port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ports-and-Slots-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="800" height="367" /></p>
<p>The only disappointment here is its USB Type-C port which doesn&#8217;t support the Thunderbolt 3. We expected this year&#8217;s model with Thunderbolt 3 as the last year&#8217;s model didn&#8217;t had it. However, it isn&#8217;t a huge problem if you don&#8217;t plan to use the External GPU or other Thunderbolt accessories.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We spent a decent time gaming and doing other mediocre to demanding tasks on this laptop. The laptop stood up to the expectations and did well in terms of providing reliable performance and efficiency. We tested the laptop by <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rendering video</a> on the Adobe Premiere and even played some AAA games at high graphics settings. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop was able to handle our multitasking and gaming tests quite easily.</p>
<p>A gaming laptop is often discredited due to its heating issues but to our surprise, this year&#8217;s Acer Predator Helios 300 did well in terms of thermal management, despite having powerful CPU and GPU inside it. Thanks to its new all-metal dual AeroBlade fans and huge exhaust vents at the back, the laptop dissipates all the inside heat out and allows CPU and GPU to work at its full potential.</p>
<p>The data transfer speeds and superfast app loading speeds are yet another impressive aspects of this laptop. Its 256GB PCIe NVME SSD doesn&#8217;t offer adequate room, but it does help in reducing the bootup times and load times of games and other applications.</p>
<p>Speaking about the benchmarks, we ran a couple of benchmark tests on the laptop to find out its actual potential. Accordingly, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (with i7-8750H and GTX 1060) scored a good P13214 on the 3DMark 11 and a 19800 on multi-core and 4560 on single-core tests via Geekbench 4 64-bit. These scores are on par with most of the other offerings in the segment which makes the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) again king of the mid-range gaming laptops segment.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>All credits to the powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics baked in, the Helios 300 does deliver exceptionally well-performance for the mid-range gaming stationed laptop. We had a good time playing games on it and even at the highest graphics settings, laptop managed to deliver the respectable framerates. However, the fans get quite vocal while gaming and its battery lasted for just 58 minutes in our gaming tests.</p>

<p>The laptop also supports virtual reality, but GTX 1060 isn&#8217;t the best GPU you can get for the VR related tasks. We tested its VR capabilities by playing some VR games, and the laptop managed to run all of them. However, the experience wasn&#8217;t the smoothest and GPU did felt a bit underpowered for VR. But, the GPU is overclockable and overclocking does reduce the lag up to an extent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Like the last year&#8217;s model, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 also comes with the same dual stereo speakers located on the bottom front of the laptop. They are backed by the Acer’s proprietary Acer TruHarmony audio tech and Dolby Audio premium, which claims to enhance the audio quality. However, the audio isn&#8217;t the loudest and its sound gets suppressed due to the bad placement of speakers.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#b3b3b3;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#cdcdcd;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You May Like to Check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life on the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is definitely not the main selling point as it comes with the same 4-cell Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery that we saw in the last year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the laptop can provide up to 7 hours of continuous usage, during our real-time usage, we managed to sustain the battery for close to 4 hours with normal usage. However, while gaming the battery life dropped to a mere 58 minutes which is tad disappointment and less as per the gaming laptop&#8217;s standards of 2018. Moreover, it takes up to two and a half hours to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>So, battery on the new Predator Helios 300 is another thing after design, Acer has used to cut manufacturing costs, and that can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If one is looking for a powerful mid-range gaming laptop, then the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is our top pick right now. It checks a lot of right boxes with its segment first 144Hz display, powerful and latest hardware, and a rather old yet good built chassis. However, a bit heavy form factor, small battery and a 256GB of SSD might be a bit of concern for few. But it&#8217;s hard to find an alternative to this laptop, especially for the price that it comes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Aspire series of laptops are undeniably a complete value for money devices. After spending months on premium laptops, I have got the budget segment Acer Aspire E 15 laptop to review. It is a common tendency to focus on the flaws and deficits the laptop has as the styling, form-factor, features, and specifications of a budget laptop are definitely far behind that of premium devices.</p>
<p>However, to my surprise, the Aspire E 15 stood up really well exceeding my expectations from a laptop priced under $400. Quite frankly, you’ll have a hard time in finding a laptop with impressive specifications, a reliable battery backup, a full HD display, and an abundant amount of RAM <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for less than $400</a>. But, Acer has again hit the sweet spot in the budget segment and their 2018 Acer Aspire E 15 notebook offers all the current generation hardware with the steeped down price tag of just $379!</p>
<p>But, how is the build quality? And, how does it perform in real world? Let’s drill down to the detailed review of Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) laptop and find out if it really is the best budget laptop of 2018.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Usually, when a 15-inch laptop strikes in your mind, there is already a typical image in everyone’s mind and it is the very first and most common impression users get. However, it is not the same case with the Aspire E 15. The laptop although comes with an old-school design pattern, like most of the other 15-inch laptops, it comes with good ergonomics.</p>
<p>Weighing at 5.27 pounds, the laptop is a tab heavy and bulky. However, thanks to its design and engineering, the weight is very uniformly distributed all across the device, making it easy to carry around.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3869 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Design-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15-inch Laptop - Design &amp; Build Quality" width="550" height="480" /></p>
<p>The laptop looks completely identical to the last year&#8217;s model as its design has been carried forward from its predecessor (<a title="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop Review – A Solid Budget-Friendly Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e15-e5-575-33bm-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E5-575-33BM</a>) which is fine because Acer is providing better specs on this year&#8217;s model by cutting down its designing and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>As far as build quality is concerned, the laptop is built from a high quality poly-carbonate plastic and it is finished in black color and has a textured lid which gives it a rather aging yet professional look. The device comes with almost the standard dimensions in terms of length, width, and height and measures 15.02 x 10.2 x 1.19 inches. The laptop feels sturdy but it does have some amount of keyboard and screen flexes which are acceptable considering the price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the port alignment on the device, you get a DVD drive, a charging port, a USB port, and an audio jack aligned with the right edge of the device. On the left edge, you get a couple of USB ports, an HDMI port, and a LAN port, neatly recessed.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD display. The display panel on the laptop is an LED-backlit one, which offers decent resolution for all the essential everyday uses. It sports a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which also makes it one among the very few laptops offering a Full HD resolution in the segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_3870" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-image-3870 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-Laptop-Display-.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H Laptop Review - Display" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>15.6&#8243; Full HD Display &#8211; Best in Segment</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Although the laptop had a decent color accuracy, the brightness was relatively low at only 175 nits. However, the laptop’s display had punchy blacks and decent contrast levels. Watching quality video content on the laptop will be satisfying but the display’s underwhelming brightness might be a bit of concern for some users. However, considering the price point, the display is definitely serviceable.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 comes with latest and top of the line specifications for the asking price. Under the hood, the device sports an 8th generation Intel Core i3-8130U dual-core processor which is the biggest highlight of this year&#8217;s model. The Coffee Lake Intel Core i3 processor is clocked at 2.2 GHz and under full throttle it can turbo boost up to 3.4GHz. The latest processor also comes with an Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics for better overall graphical performance.</p>

<p>The latest processor on the device is paired with a 6GB of RAM which is 2GB more than the last year&#8217;s model, however it is slower DDR3L RAM and this laptop&#8217;s 4+2 RAM configuration also eats up both of its RAM slots. But the good news is, RAM on the laptop can be upgraded up to whopping 32GB. As far as storage on the device is concerned, it is managed by a slow 5400 RPM 1TB hard drive which can also be replaced easily with an SSD.</p>

<p>The laptop also comes with an 8X DVD Double-Layer RW (M-Disc enabled) drive which can read and write from any CD or a DVD.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The Aspire E 15 comes with a backlit keyboard, which is a very rare scene for a laptop priced under $400. The keyboard provides a very comfortable typing experience and comes with a very sturdy and sharp key. The keys provide very good tactile feedback while using and this definitely adds on to the great typing experience. On our typing tests, I hit a rate of 72 words per minute, which is great. One should have absolutely no issues in using this laptop’s keyboard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="750" height="445" /></p>

<p>The touchpad on the device is also very neatly recessed and is very spacious. It does the job adequately well and it comes with both the left and right clickers, like the usual touchpad on a keyboard.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with an abundant number of ports and other connectivity options, which makes the laptop stand out in the segment. It sports 1 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x USB Type-C port, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, an audio jack, and an SD card reader slot.</p>
<div id="attachment_1607" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1607" class="wp-image-1607 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-576-392H Ports &amp; Slots" width="800" height="94" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-300x35.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-768x90.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-610x72.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-600x71.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-50x6.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1607" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Comes with USB Type-C, Ethernet, HDMI, VGA, USB 3.0 ports and DVD RW Drive</strong></em></p></div>
<p>On top of this, the device also comes with a VGA and a DVD writer for the ease of usage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with an HD webcam which sports a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The webcam on the device also supports High Dynamic Range, for better imaging and rendering during a video call or telephony. However, the camera isn’t that great when it comes to capturing some still photographs. The image tends to get a little smoothened and blurred out, losing out on a lot of details in the image. The sensor is, however, fast enough to render the image and adjust it on the screen quickly. Having said that all, the camera on the device serves the cause.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer has always been an exceptionally good multipurpose laptop manufacturer. Accordingly, their Aspire E 15 notebook comes equipped with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two built-in stereo speakers</span> for a surround sound effect. We used the laptop to play heavy music including various genres such as metal, symphony, and mid-focused vocals. The laptop did well and has a powerful sound, which can fill a small room.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the speakers are powered by the company’s proprietary True Harmony sound, which ensures quality audio output with more depth and details. This adds on to the experience while watching movies and playing games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As for watching videos is concerned, the laptop can take it almost any video format at any resolution and play it with ease. We played true 4K content to which the laptop had no struggle playing it whatsoever.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H), being a sub-$400 budget laptop, is still an excellent multimedia performer.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 runs on the latest Windows 10 Operating system, which is confined to the Home variant by default. Apart from housing some of the proprietary applications form the company, the laptop also packs in some additional applications, which we want to term as bloatware.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we personally felt that the laptop comes with slightly more bloatware than that of an ordinary Windows 10 running laptop. Nonetheless, one can easily uninstall the preinstalled apps with ease. The <a title="Acer Laptops Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> come with Acer Recovery management application, which we feel is quite handy, especially if you’re someone who wants to explore more out of your device. Often, people mess up with it and lose their valuable data.</p>
<p>The display of the device comes with two settings, which can be chosen by the user as per their requirements. It comes with a third-party file explorer app known as the ‘App Explorer’, which organizes and sorts the files and folders in the laptop in a slightly better manner. It also comes with CyberLink PowerDVD 14 by default, to run the inbuilt DVD writer.</p>
<p>We faced absolutely no hiccups or hurdles while using the laptop during our review, and the software on the device, never really bothered us despite the bloatware it packs in.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Intel Core i3-8130U processor paired with the 6GB of memory in the Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop provides enough power and speed for productive multitasking on the laptop. During our review, we had multiple multitasking sessions and the laptop did quite well. We even used split screen feature of Windows to play a YouTube video in full HD resolution and running a bunch of benchmarks simultaneously, to which the laptop did quite well, without any lags or stutter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3874" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) 15-inch Laptop Review" width="550" height="530" /></p>
<p>Speaking about our benchmarks, the laptop scored a decent 7,140 on the Geekbench, which gives a pretty much overall performance of the device. This is on par with all the laptops priced under $400. However, the 1TB hard disk drive provided with the laptop had poor read, write and data transfer speeds.</p>
<p>We almost tested out all the connectivity options on the laptop too and it didn’t disappoint us. The device was latching on to the Wi-Fi networks quickly and had a good connectivity range.</p>
<p>As far as the gaming on the device is concerned, considering the price, one should be aware of the fact that, it is not meant for heavy gaming. However, the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics chipset does well for basic gaming. We tested the laptop with some mediocre games such as Dirt 3 racing with graphics set to minimal-medium levels and the laptop did well handling the game and graphics. However, one cannot expect to run heavy games on the device. But what you’re getting in this device at this price range makes it a total steal for the buck.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Our current laptop, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) comes with a 6-cell Li-Ion battery (each 2,800 mAh), which makes it one of the very few devices to come with a 6-cell offering in the segment. Accordingly, the device gives an exceptional battery backup of over 7-8 hours on a continuous usage. Although the company claims that the laptop will give a battery life of over 13 hours, it doesn’t really stand true.</p>
<p>The device takes slightly over 2 hours to charge fully from 0 to 100, which is rather okay for most users. The laptop’s battery life didn’t let us down whatsoever during our usage and this is definitely one of the strong zones of this device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you’re someone asking us ‘Should I buy this laptop?’, then the answer is ‘YES’ blindfolded. That said, there is undeniably no better competitor for the laptop at this price range, yet. It has powerful innards, offers good performance, lasts long in terms of battery life, and comes with powerful multimedia abilities. What more can you expect from a laptop at this price range?</p>
<p>However, we would have been taken by a storm, if the device had an even brighter display, as that is one of the very few areas, where the laptop falls short.</p>
