<h3 class="p1">Design</h3>
<p>Few contemporaries might give Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop a tough time when it comes to specifications but in the context of design, it is going to emerge as a winner. The modern day design adds up to the image of new generation laptop; the sleek, stylish and fitting in design makes this laptop the best product for everyone looking forward to do their work in style.</p>
<div id="attachment_2400" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-image-2400 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-15.6-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 15.6- Laptop Design" width="550" height="386" /><p id="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Icicle Gold Metallic Frame</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The fact that Asus F5556UA is a lightweight laptop, makes it easier for people to chose this particular machine over the others because there are very less laptops in this segment weighing near to 5 lbs. The Asus F556UA weighs 5.1lbs and it is one of the sleekest 15 inch laptop available in the market right now. So all you tech fanatics, who wanted to have something slim in your bag packs, here is the love of your dreams.</p>
<p>Although, Asus F556UA is a slim and sleek laptop, it doesn&#8217;t compromise in offering any of the required ports &amp; slots. For more info on what ports and slots does it offer, continue reading.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The stylish Asus F556UA has a screen quality that will put critics to shame, the quality output and controlled emission of blue-light makes movies more fun and safer. The 15.6-inch Full HD LED-Lit display has a matte coating, which minimizes screen glare and protect eyes against fatigue.</p>
<div id="attachment_2401" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-image-2401 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blue-light-filter-on-Asus-F556UA-AB54-NB-15-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Blue light filter on Asus F556UA-AB54 NB 15 inch Laptop" width="611" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54&#8217;s <em>Eye Care Mode to reduce blue light</em></strong></p></div>
<p>The display panel is way slimmer and stylish when compared to other contemporaries. People who are looking forward to have an affordable laptop with some stylish features can definitely go ahead with this laptop. Even prolonged laptop users like <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops For Programming – A One Stop Shop Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers</a> are going to love the unique combination of Full HD screen view with eye-protection features.</p>
<p>Color accuracy and brightness levels of display are also up to the par, making it <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right choice for photo editing pros</a>. Overall display quality of Asus F556UA is really good and there’s hardly any laptop in this segment that can give it a tough competition. I would give five out of five stars to this laptop when it comes to serving people with quality entertainment.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>When it comes to laptop, people think of HDD and RAM as the only legitimate specifications but there’s a lot more to consider like clock speed, processor count and also processor brand. Yes! clock speed and processor count are directly proportional to the speed at which a laptop processes data. That said, the Asus F556UA-AB54 sports a powerful dual core 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U processor which is from the latest 7th Generation family of processors from Intel.</p>
<div id="attachment_2402" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-image-2402 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-Laptop-Hardware-Specifications.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 Laptop Hardware Specifications" width="550" height="411" /><p id="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>256GB SSD | 7th Generation Intel Core i5 Processor | Windows 10 64-bit &#8211; still<em> so slim!</em></strong></p></div>
<p>While Asus F556UA may appear as the thought leader in processor segment but it is bit disappointing with disk space, the laptop comes with a 256GB of SSD, which is neither enough nor in competition with the other contemporaries. Laptops in this segment generally have 1TB of HDD, whereas 500GB of HDD is considered to be the basic. Asus must work on it and release a newer version with doubled disk-space sooner.</p>
<p>Let alone the processor and disk-space, the RAM is designed to empower the already impressive processor speed. The 8GB of RAM will be able to queue up more processes and allow the processor to process them without making the laptop freeze. The smart combination of Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM is going to do wonders for workaholics and entertainment freaks.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Asus is generally not known for camera quality but with the newly designed display in place, this F556UA produces pretty impressive images. One can easily depend upon this webcam for <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating tutorial videos for youtube</a> and help the tech naysayers out there. Long story short, the webcam on Asus F556UA-AB54 is not the best you can get in segment but it is pretty good for business meetings on Skype.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Unlike the modern day laptops, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is slim and still houses all kind of ports, there’s a USB 2.0, 3.0, Type-C, an HDMI, a DVD+RW, a card reader slot and also 3.5 mm jack for quality audio video output.</p>
<p>So, you get all the ports and slots that you were familiar with on your previous computer and also the newest and fastest USB Type-C port, which is expected to do the wonders with future of computing.</p>
<div id="attachment_2403" style="width: 1015px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-image-2403 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ports-and-Slots-on-Asus-F556UA-15-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots on Asus F556UA 15 Inch Laptop" width="1005" height="265" /><p id="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Asus F556UA being a laptop with slim &amp; sleek profile provides best in class connectivity.</strong></em></p></div>
<p>I think other laptop manufacturers should learn something from Asus about making slim laptops without compromising on REQUIRED ports and slots!</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA comes pre-installed with Windows 10 64-bit operating system. It is a premium Windows laptop, which ensures free upgrade to all further Windows 10 updates. With that said, the Asus F556UA does come with a few free preloaded software packages which are &#8220;actually useful&#8221;. Asus F556UA comes with one-year warranty but the customer service of the enterprise is not that great! <a title="Laptop Tech Support Showdown! Our 2017 Ratings" href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/tech-support-showdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer and Dell emerges as a better leader</a> when it comes to providing customers with quality support and after sales support. On top of all these features, the Windows 10&#8217;s proprietary voice-assistance Cortana, is a big added advantage for the potential laptop users, and now it supports multiple languages and regions, making it geographically distinct in terms of support.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Packed with Intel core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, the laptop is designed to cater people with exceptional performance. From students, to employees to artists, this laptop is perfect for anyone with normal to mediocre level of requirements.</p>
<p>The dual core Kaby Lake i5-7200U processor has the base clock frequency of 2.5GHz and turbo boost frequency up to 3.10GHz. The processor has got all the caliber required to run and accommodate almost all the apps very smoothly without much lag. The laptop during our review, did respond well to the inputs and all the hardcore apps we threw at it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2405" style="width: 903px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-image-2405 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Performance-review-of-Asus-F556UA-laptop.jpg" alt="Performance review of Asus F556UA laptop" width="893" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS IceCool Technology keeps laptop always COOL and STABLE</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also responds very efficiently when a series of programs are launched simultaneously. One can definitely multi-task on this laptop without witnessing an iota of heat being produced. It also has the smart Asus ice-cool technology which controls inside temperature of the laptop and makes sure that the laptop always stay at comfortable temperature.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop is going to rank par above the contemporaries because the Full HD LED-lit 15 inch screen and the pitch perfect audio makes it easier for the artists to note the nitty gritty of each and every songs. The output through 3.5mm jack is an immaculate example of quality. One can finally posses a laptop that produces exceptional stereo output and is in the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">range of $500</a>. The laptop comes with the ASUS’s proprietary <strong>SonicMaster audio technology</strong> meant to fine-tune the audio output. It was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. It supports a long list of professional codecs to ensures precise sound performance. In addition to all these, it has an optimised amplifier to deliver louder volumes and deeper bass.</p>
<div id="attachment_2406" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-image-2406 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SonicMaster-Powered-Immersive-Audio-and-Video-Experience.jpg" alt="SonicMaster Powered Immersive Audio and Video Experience" width="550" height="437" /><p id="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Pitch-perfect Audio</strong></em></p></div>
<p>To test the video playback abilities of the Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop, we ran a set of HD, Full HD, and 4K content on it, to which the laptop responded really well. The detailing of the screen and the sound quality were simply superb thanks to its powerful speakers and bright display panel.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>This laptop is certainly not designed specifically for gaming but one can always run some old games on this laptop with great ease. Designed to leverage people with an exceptional working experience, this laptop is packed with specifications that can run some of your most favorite games with great ease. The laptop may lose when it comes to graphic output capacity because of lack of dedicated cards but the quality is certainly not poor. That said, it can run quite a good menu of games from the market, and being powered by the Windows 10 OS, the laptop supports a wide-range of games and apps to choose from. The modern games from the current market catalogue are also pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to checkout &#8211; <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA is packed with a 38-Whr-polymer battery which performans 2.5 times better than the standard Li-ion battery. It was compulsory for this laptop to have a long lasting battery because of the Full HD display that it is fitted with. The exceptional battery-life is going to make easier for people to go on and on without looking for a charger every now and then. The Li-polymer battery retains its 80% charge capacity even after completing hundreds of charge cycles. The battery also complies with the highest safety standards, which makes it radiation proof. During our usage, the laptop lasted for slightly over 6 hours, under heavy usage and it gets charged from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours, which is rather good.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<div id="attachment_2407" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-image-2407 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ASUS-F556UA-AB54-NB-15.622-FHD-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop Review" width="550" height="393" /><p id="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Asus F556UA emerges as winner when it comes to processing power, quality entertainment and leveraging healthier experience but fails to impress people with storage capacity.</p>
<p>The top-notch performance with audio-video output is going to win hearts and make people crave for more and more. We are pretty impressed with Asus F556UA when it comes to audio-video experience; we love the way it makes it easier for people to continue binge-watching movies without feeling restrained.</p>
<p>Like every other laptop in market, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is also not the perfect laptop. It has little dim display and the storage provided on the laptop is also not adequate for most of the users but if you&#8217;re fine with these cons then it is one of the best laptop you can buy in $700 price range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dell is globally renowned for providing laptops in various segments and it has been doing quite well to attract a huge audience with their offerings. This time, the brand has brought a mid-range 2-in-1 laptop, which comes with a cut-throat pricing for a mainstream convertible laptop.</p>
<p>Our current contender, the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, is an intruding product from the Dell’s Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 notebooks. The entire range of laptops from Dell is now coming with the latest 7th Generation Intel core processors for better performance. Since this laptop is constantly being a global best-seller, we decided to put this laptop to test, and this is what we feel of this affordable 2-in-1 notebook.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design and built quality of the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, the notebook comes with <strong>grey matte finished chassis</strong>. The laptop resembles most of the other laptops in the segment and is recessed inside a plastic chassis. On the top, the laptop comes with a gunmetal grey slab with Dell’s logo recessed in the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2302" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-image-2302 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-13-5000-2-in-1-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378 13 5000 2 in 1 Laptop - Design" width="600" height="404" /><p id="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop (Gun Metal Color)</strong></p></div>
<p>It sports a 13.3-inch display and comes with a <strong>backlit enabled chuckle keyboard</strong>, which is very well designed for all forms of usage. The trackpad is also very well placed and is comfortable to use. On the either sides of the laptop, you have one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a charging slot. Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with dimensions of 325 x 224 x 20.4mm, which makes it a slim offering in the segment. Also, the laptop <strong>weighs just 3.4 pounds</strong>, making it a perfect portable and easy to carry around laptop, which is <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students – Pro Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most suited for college students</a>, business men or anyone who wants powerful and lightweight laptop for their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2303" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-image-2303 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Different-Modes.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Different Modes" width="700" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1. Tent Mode | 2. Stand Mode | 3. Tablet Mode</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, getting deeper into the convertibility and ergonomics of this laptop, it comes with an innovative <strong>360-degree hinge</strong>, which adds on to the versatility and comfort of usage. The laptop allows you to switch easily between four different modes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tent mode</span> is perfect for using recipes in real time, this mode is also perfect for video calling your friends and family while working on something. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand mode</span> of this convertible notebook is meant for movies on the go. The typical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop mode</span> is meant for most of your routine work that you&#8217;d do from your laptops such as <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on word documents</a>, writing emails, and more.  Finally, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tablet mode</span> makes reading easy while you’re leant or reclined.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop sports a <strong>13.3-inch Full HD display</strong>, which comes with a new design emphasised on more screen and less bezel. This not only gives a larger display but also provides a wide-angle display. The display panel on the device is a TrueLife LED-backlit touch display, which provides a brilliant wide-angle view. The laptop’s screen comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving it a sharper image quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-image-2305 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-convertible-display.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 convertible laptop - display" width="800" height="553" /><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>13.3 Inch Full HD Touchscreen Display with 1920 x 1080 Resolution</strong></p></div>
<p>The laptop’s display is not the brightest you get in the segment, and we felt that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was quite dull</span>. The laptop’s sunlight legibility isn&#8217;t the best, and the blacks on the display weren&#8217;t accurate as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre. All in all, the laptop’s display is surely a worth considering drawback of the notebook. However, its touchscreen functionality works absolutely fine in almost all the use cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as aforementioned offers a good set of specifications and hardware for the asking price.</p>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, speaking about the actual innards of this laptop, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with a handsome set of hardware and features. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, the processor can achieve a clock speed of 3.10GHz, which makes it very easy for the device to handle heavy games and apps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i5 Processors (New 2017 Kaby Lake Laptops)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive <strong>1TB of hard disk with 5400RPM</strong>, which is another attractive feature for the price segment it comes under. It also houses Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor to handle all the graphic related content.</p>
<p><em>Like most of the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small convertible laptops</a>, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop also <strong>doesn&#8217;t house a CD/DVD drive</strong> with it.</em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Dell Inspiron i5378 sports a 720p camera, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. Although the images captured using the laptop’s webcam are kind of grainy, the video calls made are serviceable. The colour reproduction is accurate and a camera does manage to capture a lot of details in the images.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the laptop’s <strong>webcam uses infrared technology to bolster facial recognition</strong>. It&#8217;s actually very hard to find facial recognition in laptops at this price range, which is again a very good aspect of the laptop.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Like all other Dell Inspiron 5000 series of laptops, the 2-in-1 i5378 also comes with a good set of ports to support additional peripheral devices and to make the most of a laptop. Speaking of the ports, the laptop houses <strong>one USB 2.0 port</strong> for your regular usage, <strong>two USB 3.0 ports</strong> for enhanced data transfers and added functionalities when you connect any peripherals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY - Ports and Slots" width="519" height="334" />The laptop also houses a full sized <strong>HDMI port</strong> to connect to any display devices. As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Dell Inspiron also houses a <strong>Micro-SD card reader</strong> slot to connect with an SD card. We would have loved the USB Type-C port and we hope that Dell will include it, may be in their next generation 5000 series convertibles?</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY runs <strong>Windows 10 64-bit Home</strong> variant right out-of-the-box. Windows 10 is absolutely the most productive OS in the contemporary world and evidently, doesn&#8217;t need an introduction in the field of laptops. It is not just productive but is also the most common, easy-to-use, reliable, and an OS with the highest number of compatible apps for laptops.</p>
<p>Like all the latest Inspiron laptops, the current laptop also comes with a set of useful apps, readily installed with the laptop. These includes <em>Dell’s SupportAssist</em> app, which is a fairly useful app to provide the right tech support in case of troubleshooting. The <em>Dell Update</em> app makes sure the laptop runs on the latest OS and has all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the other apps which come preloaded with the laptop, there is some <a title="Software bloat - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloatware</a> includes such as DropBox, Royal Revolt 2, Facebook, Netflix, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Twitter, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, and Houzz. Some of them are useful but others can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>laptop comes with a one-year warranty</strong></span>, like most of the other laptops. However, Dell’s after sales support is far better than that of most of the other brands.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to the latest <strong>Kaby Lake (7th Gen)</strong> Intel Core i5-7200U Processor clocked at up to 3.10 GHz, the new Dell Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop runs utterly smooth in almost all the everyday essentials such as handling apps, using for multimedia purposes, gaming, and more. The processor is paired with a good <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which makes the laptop able to handle multitasking with ease. During our review, we tested the laptop with multiple apps running simultaneously, to which the laptop responded really well. Although there was a very minute lag, it was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>For multitasking, we tested the laptop by running benchmarking apps in the background, Google Chrome with up to 15 tabs opened simultaneously, music in the background, and with a constant connectivity to the internet. The laptop was hardly warmed even after 1 hour of such extensive usage session.</p>
<p>During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good <strong>62,482</strong> on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. On Geekbench 4, the laptop scored <strong>6800</strong> which depicts the overall system performance with a stress on graphics reproducibility. These numbers are pretty impressive for a <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops in $500 - $600 Price Range" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop priced just little above $500</a>.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics bolstered by the <strong>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor</strong>. Although the laptop does have a decent set of specifications, it is not meant for extensive and heavy gaming with high graphics and is, therefore, not a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily gaming stationed laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Although the laptop is not meant to handle heavy games such as GTA V, Battlefield, or the DEUS EX in their highest graphics mode, most of the games like the Counterstrike, heroes of the Storm, and Shadowman were still pretty much playable when the graphics set to low/medium.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop can although handle games and graphic-intense apps to an extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s not for the people whose primary concern is gaming</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with <strong>two built-in Stereo speakers</strong>, which are powered by MaxxAudio technology, for better all round sound. The speakers do a great job in providing decent audio output and also doesn&#8217;t turtle at the volume set to maximum. We played high-quality FLAC files on this laptop and the output was just as loud and clear as expected.</p>
<div id="attachment_2308" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-image-2308 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop Review" width="600" height="574" /><p id="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>High resolution display and 2-stereo speakers makes playing games and watching movies fun</strong></p></div>
<p>As far as playing videos, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop can handle HD, Full HD, 2K, and 4K videos without an issue</span> and thanks to the wide-angle screen, watching videos and movies on this 2-in-1 convertible is fun and convincing.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5378 2-in-1 is a powerful laptop with a decent set of specifications including a Full HD display. As for the battery life, the laptop stays juiced up by a 3-cell, 42 Whr battery pack. During our review, the laptop lasted for around <strong>6 hours of continuous usage</strong>. The battery backup is not the greatest considering other similar laptops in the segment delivering 8-10 hours of battery backup. The laptop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">takes about 3 hours to get charged</span> from 0 to 100.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1937" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY 13-Inch FHD Laptop" width="550" height="350" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-300x191.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />Dell Inspiron i5378 is definitely a power-packed convertible 2-in-1 laptop, which you can get at this price. The laptop does have few pros and cons, but after an extensive review, we personally feel that the laptop has more advantages and benefits than that of its drawbacks. The <strong>dull display can be overlooked</strong> with its convertible feature. Mediocre battery life can be overlooked by its powerful performance.</p>
<p>All in all, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop</span> is definitely a must buy, if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop to flaunt with looks, portability, and performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS ROG has been playing a prominent role in the gaming laptops arena since a while now. The brand is very well known to provide powerful gaming laptops under its ROG (Republic Of Gamers) series in various budget segments. Accordingly, our current contender, the ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD is a close to $1000 gaming laptop, which not only looks attractive but also provides an attractive set of features and specifications.</p>
<p>Although you won&#8217;t be getting a ground staggering gaming beast at this point, but you definitely get quite a lot more than what you pay for. The laptop is also one of the very first laptops from the ASUS ROG series to come with an RGB-backlit keyboard, which gives an absolute gaming hue to the laptop. All these styling aspects and powerful configuration of the laptop, made us pick this for our review, and here is what we think of it:</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Asus ROG Strix GL553VD comes in a furious looking blend of black and orange coloured chassis, which gives it all the necessary gaming look, one would expect from a gaming laptop. The laptop is made up of all plastic chassis, which, however, feels of superior quality and feels sturdy. The laptop’s lid sports a pair of orange strips running across the ROG logo, which gives a slightly different look from its predecessors. The bottom of the laptop comes with rubber feet, to give an extra grip even at inclined and smooth surfaces.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2096" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD Gaming Laptop Build Quality Review" width="600" height="547" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review-300x274.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review-50x46.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking of the measurements and weight of the laptop, it weighs around 5.5 pounds and comes with dimensions of 15.1 x 10 x 1.2 inches. The laptop measures just like any of the usual 15.6-inch laptop in the market. As per the measurements, the laptop isn&#8217;t heavy or bulky to carry around. However, that said, it&#8217;s not pretty light either.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD - Thinness" width="600" height="622" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-289x300.jpg 289w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-48x50.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking about the alignment of ports on the laptop, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, and a couple of USB 3.0 ports, a USB type-C port, and a headphone jack on the left end. Towards the right end, it comes with a single USB 2.0 port, a DVD drive, and a locking slot. The laptop comes with an SD card reader towards the lower end of the keyboard and is located just beneath the palm rest.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the GL553VD is a completely redesigned one. It is now a RGB lighting keyboard which Asus calls it as a <em>Aura lighting keyboard</em>. The lights on the keyboard can be customised through the pre-installed Asus keyboard color adjustment software. As far as typing is concerned, the keys on keyboard are spacious and gives very nice tactile feedback while typing. The key travel distance is also 2.5mm which is standard and good for the &#8220;gaming laptop&#8217;s keyboard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Overall, the all-matte black finish on the laptop makes this laptop look extremely stylish and thanks to its well-built ergonomics, the laptop feels easy to hold and carry around.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD gaming laptop sports a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS-like display panel and comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. The laptop comes with a wide view of 178 degrees, which we felt was pretty good in the real time usage. Moreover, the panel gets equipped with a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is also a good aspect for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2100" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-image-2100 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Display Review" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-caption-text">15.6 Inch Full HD Matte Finish 178 Degree Wide View Display</p></div>
<p>The blacks on the display were punchy, and almost all the colours were pretty accurate. The display on the laptop has got the right amount of contrasts, one would be needing in gaming and other viewing experiences. The best part about the display we felt during the review was the colour consistency which was pretty uniform even from extreme positions. And although the laptop doesn&#8217;t come with an anti-glare coating, it does resist reflections and glare on the screen. These aspects of the display qualifies this <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/">laptop for photo editing</a> and also for other works where color accuracy of the display is  important.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a 17-inch variant of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL753VD</em> which comes with exactly the same specs as this laptop but it sports a bigger 17.3 inch display. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a bigger laptop to play games then you can go with GL753VD, which will cost you around $30 bucks more than the current model. | <a title="Recommended Laptop Retailer - Amazon.com" href="http://amzn.to/2mcYSJj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL753VD 17.3 Inch Gaming Laptop</strong></em></a>.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Now with all that said about the design and display of this power-packed gaming laptop, let&#8217;s dive into the hardware specifications of the Strix GL553VD. Speaking about the innards of this laptop, the ASUS ROG Strix comes with an equally powerful set of hardware configuration. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th gen intel core i7 processor paired with an abundant 16GB of RAM. The quad-core i7 kaby lake processor is clocked at 2.8GHz and can turbo boost up to 3.8GHz, making sure that, multiple demanding applications run on the laptop with ease. Graphics on the laptop are bolstered and are handled really well by newer Pascal based NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card.</p>
<div id="attachment_2101" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-image-2101 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD Hardware Review" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-300x180.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-50x30.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-caption-text">Next-Generation Performance | New NVidia GeForce GTX Pascal Based Graphics &amp; Kaby Lake CPU</p></div>
<p>As far as the storage on the laptop is concerned, it is backed by a 1TB of HDD with a speed of 7200RPM. The laptop also comes with a DVD drive to read and write CD/DVDs. Upgrading this laptop is also fairly easy. The RAM is easily accessible and it can be upgraded up to 32GB. Even storage drive of this laptop can be upgraded but that is the little complicated process and you may void the warranty if you do this on your own.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another model of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL553VE</em> which has slightly more powerful GPU and faster SSD storage. To be accurate, it has powerful NVidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti Graphics and it offers 1TB of 7200RPM hard drive and an extra 256GB of SSD storage which vastly improves the gaming performance of the laptop. Of-course, this added performance will come by spending some extra money! | <strong><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2naefqf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL553VE Gaming Laptop</em></a></strong>.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<div id="attachment_2102" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-image-2102 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD - Webcam" width="600" height="247" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-300x124.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-caption-text">With HD Webcam You Can Stream Your Game Play with Friends or on YouTube</p></div>
<p>We never focus a primary light on this aspect of a laptop, especially if it is a gaming-stationed one. However, we understand that the webcam on a laptop should be serviceable for occasional video calls. Thankfully, the 720p camera on the Strix manages to take decent images and is pretty serviceable for video calls. However, the images captured are not very sharp and tends to get blurry at times. The image adjusts quickly on the screen, which we felt was very good for video calling.</p>

<p>The laptop comes with a long list of ports and connectivity options to accommodate additional peripherals (gaming accessories). It sports a couple of USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port. In addition to that, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, a <strong>USB Type-C port</strong>, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Unlike most of the current laptops, it comes with a DVD drive, which read/writes data from DVDs and CDs. The laptop also houses an SD card slot to transfer files back and forth between memory card and laptop.</p>
<h4>Software</h4>
<p>Asus has preloaded its Strix laptop with the right fusion of gaming beneficiary software, which is high on productivity and gaming aspects. The laptop comes with Windows 10 preloaded on the software front, and also comes equipped with the ASUS&#8217;s proprietary ROG gaming centre.</p>
<p>This gives games a whole new level of overall performance increase and also keeps the laptop’s temperature in control even after heavy gaming. The ROG gaming centre properly utilises the CPU and GPU performances and provides the most of the both. In addition to this, this laptop also includes alternatives to boost up the exhaust speeds and disable the Windows key during gaming.</p>
<p>The laptop comes preloaded with almost all the Windows 10 apps and features and is, therefore, an equally able laptop in terms of overall productivity.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD comes with a fully-loaded future-proof set of specifications and hardware. So evidently, we expect top class performance from the laptop. We put this laptop to test, to check out whether it can really provide us with the performance we expect from a gaming beast of this calibre. And here is what we found:</p>
<p>The laptop runs absolutely smooth and does a great job in multitasking. During our entire review, we never faced any performance related hiccups, and the laptop was able to handle almost everything we threw at it. Thanks to its latest 7th gen Intel core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM, the Strix delivers impeccable performance. We multitasked the laptop with Chrome running around 15 tabs simultaneously, a 4K video running in the background, a benchmarking app loaded and was connected to WiFI all the time. The laptop was able to handle them all with ease.</p>
<p>For the overall performance of the laptop, we tested it with Geekbench 3, in which the laptop notched a score of 14,120, which is absolutely great for a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptop priced $1000</a>. As far as the gaming is concerned, the in-house 4GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU is a show-stealer here. The laptop can handle almost all the modern games even the graphics set to maximum. However, you&#8217;ll feel that smooth lag-free gaming with more than 35-40fps when you play them with graphics set to medium. We played GTA V on high graphics mode and the laptop although responded very well to the games, we personally felt that it did a better job when graphics were set to medium.</p>
<p>All that said, The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD unarguably provides a beastly performance for the asking price.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop easily handled almost all formats of video content. We tested it with 4K, Full HD, and HD videos and the Strix GL553VD handled them all with ease. However, it was the audio quality, which failed to reach our expectations. The audio felt muffled at times and was not detailed on the notes. At maximum volume, we felt a crackling like sounds, which disappointed us.</p>

<p>Audio on the laptop is also a bit thin and weak when compared to its rivals in the price segment. However, the sound output on the laptop is still serviceable. Thanks to the preinstalled ICEpower AudioWizard software programs tuning audio was easy.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Like most of the gaming laptops these days, ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD also comes with a pretty mediocre battery life, and you&#8217;ll have to carry your power adapter if you take Strix anywhere out. The laptop is powered by a non-removable 4-cells 48 WHr battery, which lasted for just over 4 hours for us on our usage. This included casual web browsing, online videos streaming, few benchmarking apps, and some gaming. The laptop takes around 3 hours to get fully charged from 0 to 100. All in all, the battery backup of this laptops isn&#8217;t groundbreaking and is strictly average. We seriously felt this was an area the laptop was lagging behind its rivals to an extent.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2041 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD Gaming Laptop Full In depth Review" width="500" height="365" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000.jpg 500w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000-300x219.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Keeping it very simple, the Asus ROG Strix GL553VD is a very attractive looking gaming laptop with punchy aesthetics and powerful hardware. The laptop also provides very good performance and gaming experience. The only aspects which are a let down in this laptop are its battery life and audio output. However, on an overall note, the laptop is a complete show stealer, when compared to its rivals and is, therefore, our choice of gaming laptop if your budget is around $1000.</p>
