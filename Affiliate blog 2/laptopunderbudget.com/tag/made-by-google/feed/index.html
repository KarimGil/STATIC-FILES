										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s about time that Google decided to up their tablet game with their Chrome OS. The Pixel Slate was unveiled on October 9th and it seems to shatter all the stereotypes that were widely accepted about Google&#8217;s slight incompetency in crafting premium tablets.</p>
<p>Although Google has decided to abandon Android tablets altogether, the Pixel Slate&#8217;s touch has a very Android-like feel to it. The UI however, has a quite Pixel-y sense to it. Even though the screen is 12.3-inches which is pretty wide for a phone like interface with icons spread across the screen. The device weighs a total of 1.6 pounds and quite frankly, feels even lighter. Google was quite particular in ensuring the center balance of the device is intact for improved accessibility when the device is held up like a tablet.</p>
<p>The convertibility aspects are quite spectacular too. The cover of the tablet smoothly glides on the back surface of the device to be adjusted in 3 different positions. It latches on to the embedded magnets inside the device which takes out the annoying hinges and screws out of the picture. The Pixel Slate auto shifts from tablet mode to PC mode. Though convenient- but at times the lack of manual switching might feel like a restriction. The Slate detects the presence of a mouse or trackpad and transforms into cursor mode for more precision during usage and of course, to give the users a PC like feel. The backlit keyboard is an appreciable addition to the Google tablets and was long overdue as well. On top of backlighting, the keys are in circular shape which although is a nice innovation but might take some time getting used to.</p>
<h3>Have a look at more detailed specifications:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions: 7.0mm x 290.85mm x 202.04mm</li>
<li>Weight: 1.6 lbs (without keyboard)</li>
<li>Color: Midnight Blue</li>
<li>Display: 12.3” 3000 x 2000 (293 ppi) LCD “Molecular Display” (400 nits) with Pixelbook Pen support</li>
<li>Processor options: 8th Gen Intel Core m3, i5, i7 or Intel Celeron</li>
<li>RAM options: 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB</li>
<li>Storage options: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, or 256GB SSD</li>
<li>Battery: 48 WHr, up to 10 hours (supports fast charging)</li>
<li>Ports: two USB-C, keyboard connector</li>
<li>Wireless: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, no LTE option</li>
<li>Audio: Dual front-facing speakers, two mics</li>
<li>Front camera: 8MP,  ƒ/1.9 aperture, 1.4um pixel size, 1080p video at 30 fps</li>
<li>Rear Camera: 8MP, ƒ/1.8 aperture, 1.12um pixel size, Auto Focus, 1080p video at 30 fps</li>
<li>Security: “Pixel Imprint” fingerprint sensor on power button, Titan C security chip</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeap, we know what you are thinking. Where&#8217;s the headphone jack? Turns out, Google has decided to skip the 3.5mm headphone jack altogether. Google says that the decision was based on the fact that most advanced users are transitioning towards Bluetooth accessories. There is, however, a headphone jack dongle with the device but seems kind of silly using it with a sleek, convertible laptop/tablet. Loses its essence don&#8217;t you think? On the bright side, there are two USB-C ports. Largely intended for fast charging and 4K video output. There is also a custom keyboard connector and two microphones along with a power button with an embedded fingerprint scanner. A classy move indeed.</p>
<p>The display of the device is quite extraordinary. The Slate has a pixel density of 293 ppi surrounded by thin bezels which only compliments the resolution of 2000 x 3000 pixels. Google has chosen to brand the screen technology of Pixel Slate by giving it the name “Molecular Display.” The screen technology uses low-temperature polycrystalline silicon or LTPS which is known for its effects on optimal battery life. Google claims that their Slate cum PC can hold up to 10 hours of juice in a single run.</p>
<h3>Pricing sheet</h3>
<p>The specs and display of the Pixel slate scream convertible more than any other tablet that Google has released. If paired with the right accessories, this Slate has every capability to be used as a full-fledged PC.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4276" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Google-Pixel-Slate-revealed.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Slate revealed" width="690" height="345" /></p>
<p>For the keyboard, there are three choices to opt from.  Any Bluetooth keyboard, a $149 Brydge Bluetooth keyboard specifically designed for the Pixel Slate with an included trackpad, much like the ones Brydge sells for the iPad and Surface Pro. Last but the best &#8211; Google’s very own first-party accessory, the $199 Pixel Slate Keyboard.</p>
<p>The Pixel Slate is priced like PCs too. The tablet is available in multiple variants, starting from $600 with an Intel Celeron processor to a $1600 model with an Intel Core i7 processor.</p>
<h4>Here is the full price sheet:</h4>
<ul>
<li id="0ITYN6">$599 (4GB RAM, 32GB SSD, Intel® Celeron processor)</li>
<li id="0KRLKK">$699 (8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, Intel® Celeron processor)</li>
<li id="85pbgP">$799 (8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, 8th Gen Intel® Core m3 processor)</li>
<li id="taWdZr">$999 (8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 8th Gen Intel® Core i5 processor)</li>
<li id="AbBSCW">$1599 (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 8th Gen Intel® Core i7 processor)</li>
<li id="i1hwn6">Pixel Slate Keyboard &#8211; $199</li>
<li id="rUGXEk">Brydge Bluetooth Keyboard &#8211; $159</li>
<li id="zUJtJ8">Pixelbook Pen &#8211; $99</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final word</h3>
<p>The Pixel Slate is a massive jump for Google from their failed Nexus tablets to Chrome-based PC convertibles. And I mean it in a good way.</p>
<p>Due to its slim design, the device is not lap friendly when connected with a keyboard but that seems like one of the few minor inconveniences of the device.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that Google is in line and ready to compete with the strongest tablet contenders in the market &#8211; the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro. It will be interesting to see how this pans out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only a week left before the &#8216;Made by Google&#8217; event which is the grand launch of Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones. Nonetheless, techies are also psyched about the unveiling of Pixel Slate and more so because it is rumoured to dual boot Windows 10.</p>
<h3>But why do we think so?</h3>
<p>It was revealed in the Chromium documentation that surfaced sometime in July, a <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/1155570">commit</a> that mentions &#8216;<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/upcoming-chromebook-nocturne-named-pixel-slate/">Nocturne</a>&#8216; a.k.a Pixel Slate along with Windows 10.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Windows 10 will BSOD early during boot with the way things are currently laid out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This might just mean that Windows 10 might appear in a future <a title="Chromebook Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/chromebooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook</a> model. But with the upcoming Google event and the rumors about Pixel Slate, it only makes so much sense that these two might come in a package.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/bmpblk/+/1236014">Chromium code commit</a> suggests renaming &#8216;alt-os&#8217; to &#8216;dual boot&#8217;. This seems like good enough evidence to raise speculations about a dual boot OS related to this project.</p>
<blockquote><p>Add select_os, rename &#8216;alt os&#8217; to &#8216;dual boot&#8217;.</p>
<p>Add campfire specific image resources</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Alt-OS&#8217; a.k.a &#8216;Project Campfire&#8217; believed as Google&#8217;s project for incorporating dual-booting option and Chrome OS in a single device.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, another <a href="https://review.coreboot.org/c/coreboot/+/27605/1..3//COMMIT_MSG">commit</a> resurfaced stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve got an OS that can&#8217;t boot with the way things are currently laid out</p></blockquote>
<p>With these slight hints, I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that Google has been planning this for a while and what better device to inaugurate this feature in than their very own hybrid, Pixel Slate.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; letter-spacing: -1px;">Final Verdict for Pixel Slate</span></p>
<p>Uptil now, only the Pixel Book has officially been declared to have support for both Google OS and Windows 10. With the Pixel Slate having rumored to have the same capabilities, might not necessarily be a mean a good thing. Since Windows 10 already has a vast user base, there is a huge possibility that the Chrome OS might fail in this tablet. Which would be a shame considering that a hybrid convertible tablet, having the robustness to support  Chrome OS, Linux, Android and Windows 10 singularly is a bold yet an impressive move by Google.</p>
<p>But since Google has extended their Chrome OS to support Linux and Android apps, we can see  Chrome OS is rapidly emerging as a powerful and versatile OS.</p>

<p>With Google&#8217;s Pixel phone leaks and rumors taking over the news feed like a storm, the Chromebook updates are certainly not left behind.</p>
<p>Seems like the much awaited &#8216;Nocturne&#8217; &#8211; a tablet 2 in 1 convertible with a detachable keyboard and two Intel processor generations, is going to be unveiled as the <em><strong>Pixel Slate</strong></em>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/RDRv3/status/1045319666141290497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1045319666141290497&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2018%2F09%2F27%2Fgoogle-pixel-slate-nocturne%2F">David Ruddock</a>, the infamous tech-journalist, the news comes from a reliable source.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google Pixel Slate is the name of Google&#8217;s first Chrome OS tablet. This name has been offered up so many times as a possibility I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s worthy of a story, but this is from a source I trust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although there is no official word regarding the latest hybrid Chromebook being named Pixel Slate, there are certainly enough rumors to support the evidence. For instance, the addition of a fingerprint sensor on top of the the tablet screen &#8211; a feature that has long been missing from the Chrome OS. Some leaked images have also resurfaced suggesting that this hybrid &#8216;Slate&#8217; will include a third-party keyboard made by Brydge. These features if true, fit the Pixel description perfectly.</p>
<p>Being one of Google&#8217;s novelty tablets featuring the Chrome OS, Pixel Slate is also rumored to dual boot Windows 10. This might be the trump card for Pixel Slate on this year&#8217;s Made by Google event as currently the only device to support this feature is the Pixelbook. That being said, the Pixel Slate is not necessarily to be launched with Windows 10 support. All we can say at this point is that the Windows 10 addition might be in Google&#8217;s roadmap for this device.</p>
<p>The rumors do seem to fit the puzzle as with these specs, the Nocturne might as well be the sibling of Google&#8217;s other Pixel products. But there so much we can speculate, we will leave the rest to be confirmed on October 9th, that is the launch of Google&#8217;s Pixel 3 phone . Despite the launch of Pixelbook being not less than a year ago, the Chromebook fans are definitely excited to see what Made by Google event might have in store for them this year.</p>
