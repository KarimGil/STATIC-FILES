<p>It is evident that there is hardly a difference of around 10-20fps in the gameplay of graphics intensive games in both these segments of laptops. Moreover, all three games are playable on the Acer Predator Helios 300 in ultra settings with fps ranging around 60-70fps, and that is not at all disappointing. Moreover, you can scale down a few settings to add up of about 10-15fps for more smoother gameplay.</p>

<p>Well, a&nbsp;gaming laptop under 1000 dollars can do most of the tasks efficiently, but&nbsp;a laptop priced at around 1500 dollars can provide a better graphics output and performance. That said, if you are a kind of user who needs the most from a device and needs a <a title="The Best Laptops for CAD – Our Most Recommended Laptops for AutoCAD &amp; SOLIDWORKS" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-cad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop&nbsp;to work on CAD</a>&nbsp;or any other intensive applications like&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Premiere&nbsp;and Sony Vegas to edit videos</a>, the higher specced device will be a good fit, provided you have a budget of around $1500.</p>

<p>Here comes the best pure gaming based laptop in the list, the Dell Alienware m17. Alienware series of laptops from Dell are very well renowned in the market for their impeccable and uninterrupted gaming performance.</p>
<p>This is the newest Alienware 17.3-inch laptop which sports a 1080p IPS display with brightness up to 300-nits. It can satisfy almost all the core laptop users including the hardcore gamers. The laptop is powered by the newest 9th generation Intel core i7 processor clocked up to 4.5GHz. Multitasking on the laptop is driven by a 16GB of fast DDR4 RAM which is ample for playing games and in case if you need more RAM then it also has an extra slot to upgrade the RAM up to 32GB. As far as storage is concerned, it has a spacious 512GB SSD which will be sufficient for most gamers however, if you want more storage then storage drives are easily accessible to upgrade.</p>
<p>Graphics on this laptop are also very well managed. It has Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card with 6GB of DDR6 memory. This laptop can run all the latest games without any problem, and it manages to stay cool all the times hence it has managed to top our list of the best gaming laptops under 1500 dollars.</p>
<p>The only downside — Alienware m17 has huge dimensions and it weighs around 6 pounds which makes it hard to travel with and carry to different places. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a smaller and portable gaming laptop, then you should probably check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/gaming-laptops-desktops/new-alienware-m15-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alienware m15</a> which is equally powerful and far more portable than the Alienware m17.</p>

<p>Razer has a well-established portfolio in the field of thin and light gaming laptops. The laptops from this manufacturer are very well-renowned to possess solid configuration in a very slim MacBook like chassis.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the recently launched 2019 Razer Blade 15 comes heftily loaded with the powerful configuration in just a 0.7-inch thick chassis which weighs just 4.4 pounds. The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch full HD display with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">100% sRGB coverage</span> which makes it unique in the segment. The device is powered by the latest and greatest 9th generation Intel Core i7 six-core processor paired with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of HDD and 256GB of SSD storage. Graphics on this laptop is backed by a powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q GPU which is hard to believe considering the overall size and weight of the notebook. Moreover, the laptop doesn&#8217;t even compromise with the connectivity options. Its thin profile accommodates 3 standard USB 3.1 ports, 1 USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 support, a Mini Display port, a full-sized HDMI and even Gigabit Ethernet jack!</p>
<p>It comes with a clean copy of Windows 10 Home pre-installed with zero bloatware which is something you expect when you pay premium. Moreover, it has two front facing speakers which delivers an excellent multimedia experience. On a conclusive note, the Razer Blade 15 is a lightweight gaming beast which although costs a little more than $1500, we think it&#8217;s still a great value for money machine for professional gamers and content creators.</p>

The Sager-15 is their recently launched gaming laptop which comes packed with newest Intel processor and Nvidia GPUs. The laptop comes with a black brushed matte finishing throughout and features an aluminum lid with a minimal looking Sager logo which adds on to the elegance of the laptop.

It provides a decent amount of storage with 512GB of SSD and there&#8217;s also an empty storage drive bay to put an another HDD or SSD inside.</p>
<p>On a full charge, the laptop can outlast for slightly more than 5 continuous hours, which is a decent backup considering the configuration it packs in and its 15-inch full HD IPS 144Hz display. Sager NP8957 15&nbsp; has thus managed to creep into our list of best gaming laptops under $1500.</p>

<p class="p1">Buying a gaming laptop under $500 can be quite subjective. Evidently, at this budget one cannot expect the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop to run most graphic-intensive games</a> at higher frame rates because $500 is still a&nbsp;starting range to buy the&nbsp;gaming laptop.</p>
<p class="p1">With that said, I am not underrating&nbsp;the gaming laptops under $500 by any means.&nbsp;They are the best power packed budget laptops&nbsp;to play games, but the fact is, they will only be able to run the older games like CS GO, League of Legends, Minecraft, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">You cannot expect to run the newer gaming titles like PUBG, Fortnite or GTA 5 on these laptops because they aren&#8217;t capable enough to run them. There may be a possibility, that some budget laptops might run these games but they will still struggle to deliver the smooth gameplay.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore I&nbsp;highly recommend you to increase your budget to at least $800 because <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptops in&nbsp;$800 price range</a> are capable enough to run most of the new games at decent graphics&nbsp;settings.</p>
<p class="p1">
</div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well if you don&#8217;t want to increase your budget and want to&nbsp;buy the&nbsp;gaming laptop within your 500 dollars budget then&nbsp;finding&nbsp;a laptop which is fit for your need and budget is no less than a herculean task.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 has been one of our most recommended gaming laptops since it was launch in 2017. We got a revision in 2018 with some changes in internals, but it was a mere spec bump as the chassis did not see anything new. In 2019, Acer has remastered it’s best selling machine by giving it a complete design overhaul and revamped thermals which Acer claims will lead to a significant difference in the experience of an average gamer.</p>
<p>When put to the test, the new Predator Helios 300 does deliver the claims made by the company while still keeping the price near to $1000. The new design appeals a look which is more modern than ever, the spec sheet with the Core i7 9750H hexa core processor and Nvidia’s Turing graphics ticks all the checkboxes and leaves nothing more to be desired. The new cooling solution also seems to help a lot. Overall, on the performance front, Acer has delivered the no-nonsense gaming machine which every gamer always asked for.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design is the most improved aspect of this machine. The 2019 Predator Helios 300 has an entirely new blue design which calls for a breath of fresh air after years of generic red and black gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The laptop has an aluminum top surface and deck, which combined with the sturdy hinge, provide the feel of strong build quality. It does add a little bit of weight though, the laptop weighs 5.1 lbs (2.3 kg) which is not light by any means, but it is slightly lighter and slimmer than the <a title="Acer Predator Helios 300 Review (PH315-51-78NP) – Breaking Stereotypes of Budget Gaming Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-review-ph315-51/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous generation</a>. It is still on the bulkier side but in line with the competition and portable enough to carry in a backpack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5868 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-2019-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 (2019) Gaming Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="680" height="400" /></p>
<p>The design is ergonomic and minimalist. The only problem I faced was that the outline is a little angular which caused some trouble while typing and needs getting used to. Apart from that, the overall new design language by Acer was a much needed change and will be appreciated by every user.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 houses a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS display, which has a refresh rate of 144 Hz and a response time of 3ms. On-paper, the display is on par with the other <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costly gaming laptops</a> out there.</p>
<p>The thin bezels add to the clean design language that Acer is going for. The 79% screen-to-body ratio provides the laptop with a sleek and modern look. They are not super-thin, so it can house the webcam up top unlike modern ultrabooks even though nobody is going to use it because it’s only good enough for video calls as there is no Windows Hello support.</p>
<div id="attachment_5871" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-image-5871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL 1080p 144Hz Display Review" width="612" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Best Display in Sub-$1000 Gaming Laptops Category</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The color accuracy is better than average with 97% SRGB and 75% ARGB color gamut. It’s not <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect for color accurate work</a>, but more than enough for a great gaming experience. The peak brightness of the panel was recorded at 343 nits which should result in good visibility outdoors.</p>
<p>The panel does suffer from backlight bleed issues. It is not the same on all the laptops and will depend totally on luck if your panel is unusable in a worst-case scenario. Backlight bleed does not affect gaming or reading text a lot, where it’s most noticeable is movies that have black bars on the corners of the screen.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard and trackpad are the most easily underlooked parts in <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptops</a>. The keyboard on this laptop is similar on the inside as the last year’s model. Even though it looks different with the blue accents and RGB backlighting, the underlying functionality and the layout is the same for the most part.</p>
<div id="attachment_5873" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-image-5873 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Trackpad.jpg" alt="2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Trackpad Review" width="750" height="484" /><p id="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>White Backlit Keyboard with Blue Accent</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Small improvements are made to the keyboard like increased key travel distance and 4 zone RGB backlight instead of the red backlight from last year. Some lower configurations don’t have the complete customizable RGB backlighting but only a subtle white light which is still better than red.</p>
<p>The trackpad has a plastic surface; it is inferior to glass trackpads but does the job. It does not suffer any hiccups or misreads thanks to windows precision drivers. The size is also good enough. Both the trackpad and keyboard are easy to get used to, and most people will find them comfortable to use without any complaints.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The new Acer Predator Helios 300 features the same specifications as any other $1200 gaming laptop in 2019, a hexa-core i7-9750H CPU that can boost up to 4.5 GHz on a single core and 4.0 GHz on all cores, 16GB of dual-channel memory and Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics with 6GB of GDDR6 virtual memory.</p>
<p>However, the spec sheet is not where it’s at. The optimization and tuning done by Acer take this laptop one step ahead of the competition. It comes factory-undervolted, which allows the CPU to maintain boost clock while sucking less power and generating less heat as a result. The ‘Turbo’ button overclocks the GPU and runs the fans at max speed to get the most out of the machine. Acer has taken care of every small detail which allows this laptop to edge out the competition. One thing to note here is that Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti comes in a few different configurations meant for different form factor designs. The Predator Helios 300 houses a full 80W TDP configuration of the GTX 1660 Ti. It’s safe to say it is the most powerful GTX 1660 Ti laptop out there.</p>

<p>The rest of the components are pretty well balanced; there are a few storage options to choose from. You can configure the laptop on Amazon with either a 256GB or a 512GB NVMe SSD. The read and write speeds are similar to most NVMe SSDs out there. On the inside, there are 2x SODIMM memory slots, 2x M.2 drive slots and an empty 2.5-inch drive bay to add a SATA SSD or a spinning HDD of your choice. Ram, storage and WiFi card can easily be upgraded by opening only a few screws. Acer has ensured the machine is very user-friendly to upgrade and service.</p>

<p>Gaming performance is where the 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 shines; it manages to stick out from the stack of all GTX 1660 Ti laptops by beating every single one of them. The dual-channel memory helps to achieve better 1% lows, and the experience is seamless. The CPU stayed at peak boost frequency all the time while playing Battlefield V.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of competitive multiplayer titles, dropping the graphics settings a bit can help max out the fps to match the display’s 144 Hz refresh-rate which is the best way to enjoy these titles.</p>
<h3>Thermals &amp; Acoustics</h3>
<p>The two fans, one dedicated to the CPU and GPU each, exhaust air out of the four vents, two on the rear, and two on the sides. Acer has done a great job of keeping this laptop cool by pre-undervolting the CPU. Under full load, the keyboard deck stays under a manageable 50°C. The CPU temperature reached a high of 85°C, and the GPU touched a max of 70°C. These temperatures are easily manageable, and no thermal throttling or power limit throttling was noticed. The testing was done with an ambient temperature of 22°C, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<div id="attachment_5874" style="width: 667px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-image-5874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3D-Aero-Blade-Fans-on-2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="New 3D Aero Blade Fans on 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop" width="657" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Improved 4th Gen 3D Aero Blade Fans for Better Airflow</strong></em></p></div>
<p>If you’re doing any CPU-heavy tasks on this laptop, you’re going to see the best results with the Turbo profile that can be initiated with the Turbo button on the deck. It automatically sets the optimum clock speed for the GPU and provides the CPU 25% more power to work with. It does increase the fan noise to slightly uncomfortable 55dB as it ramps up the fans to max speed. But that’s a sacrifice you’re going to have to make to maximize performance. It’s unnoticeable when you have headphones on.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>On the left, the laptop features a Kensington lock, power connector, an RJ45 ethernet jack, 2x USB 3.1 ports, and a combo headphone jack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5876 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Gaming Laptop Ports and Slots" width="708" height="602" /></p>
<p>On the right, we see a full-size HDMI port, a mini DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.1 port, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port.</p>
<p>The only thing missing here is an SD card slot, which is a bummer for <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative professionals</a> who use SD cards to transfer data to and from cameras. The type-c port, sadly, does not support Thunderbolt 3.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery on this laptop is a 58 Wh unit. Battery backup was recorded at 3-3.5 hours while doing normal tasks like browsing and watching a video with screen brightness at 250 nits and using Nvidia Optimus to force use the integrated Intel graphics. Under load, while gaming or doing any heavy tasks, don’t expect more than 45 minutes of juice out of the small battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5882 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-PH315-52-78VL-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Review - best gaming laptop in $1000 price range" width="628" height="500" /></p>
<p>The 180W AC adapter is fairly large but can be easily managed in a backpack. It adds some weight making the package about 6.1 lbs (2.8 kg) heavy to carry around.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>For $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 provides amazing value when compared to the competition. Not only does this machine outperform every <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other similarly priced laptop</a>, it does so without any compromises. With the out of the box CPU undervolt, Acer has knocked this one out of the park.</p>
<p>The balanced specifications on this laptop make it a good buy for gamers and content creators. It has a good screen, a stellar keyboard, can be easily upgraded, provides excellent gaming performance, and stays cool while doing so. The price drops to below $1100 often, and in the Black Friday sale, it dropped to a lowest of $930, which makes the Predator Helios 300 the best bang for the buck gaming laptop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer is one such company, which has made its name and fame in the gaming laptop segment. The company has been launching powerful gaming laptops in various segments at various price points. Acer’s Predator series of laptops are globally reputed for their performance and power.</p>
<p>With the company launching multiple devices in the gaming laptop market such as the beastly Predator 21X and the sleek and stylish Predator Triton 700, the company has recently updated their already well-known Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop. The 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is a very straightforward, powerful, and no-nonsense gaming laptop. The device carries a lot of USPs with it and offers an improved and powerful gaming performance for the asking price.</p>
<p>Priced at under $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 offers all the current generation hardware and the fast refresh-rate display which has made it gain rapid popularity. We spent a good amount of time with the device to test its caliber. And, here is what we think of it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design, there isn’t much of an upgrade here. Having said that, the 2018 Helios 300 looks exactly identical to the last year’s model.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Helios 300 at the very first glance looks to be much thinner and compact than that of the other laptops in the segment. However, when you hold the device and start using it, you’ll realize that it, in fact, is on a bulkier side. The device comes with a dimension of 10.47 x 15.35 x 1.05 inches, which is a little wider and thicker for a 15-inch laptop. The device weighs slightly over 5.5 pounds and can be quite cumbersome to carry around. However, considering the fact that it is a gaming laptop and has a lot of engineering within, it might not be an issue for most of us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Design" width="650" height="406" /></p>
<p>Acer this time has come up with newer color variants, to give gamers a choice. It has unveiled the special edition Acer Predator Helios 300, which comes clad in a white-and-gold chassis. However, we still don&#8217;t know when it will hit the stores.</p>
<p>The one which we tested looks just like its predecessor and has the same angular design going all around with red and black color scheme. Its aluminum lid has a huge Predator logo and a red lining on either side which gives it a proper gaming hue, however, it doesn&#8217;t light up like Alienware and some <a title="All MSI Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/msi-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end MSI laptops</a>.</p>
<p>Most gamers would love the design of this laptop, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an out of the box gaming laptop design, then the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) might not please you that much.</p>
<div id="attachment_3941" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Lid-design.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 - Lid design" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Premium looking Metal Lid with Huge Predator Logo and Red Lines on Either Side</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the build quality, there is a lot of plastic used in the making of chassis of this laptop. However, there are no compromises with the build quality and laptop feels very solid to hold. Moreover, it comes with a pretty ergonomic form-factor making it subtle to carry around and use.</p>
<p>As far as ports and slots are concerned, they are neatly recessed on both sides of the laptop and they are smartly placed in a way that wired gaming mouse won&#8217;t hinder your gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Almost all the Acer Predator series of laptops come with a short-stroke keyboard, which might not often be preferred for gaming. The keys on the Helios 300, comes with a travel of the only 1.2mm into the frame on a press, which is not much. This affects the tactile feedback on the keyboard. However, this doesn’t hold true for regular usage including documents editing and other general tasks.</p>
<p>However, the gamers will like the keys on the device as they are very brightly backlit and come in non-changeable red color hue to match the styling. The keys come with a slight curve, which adds on to the typing experience nonetheless.</p>

<p>Speaking about the trackpad on the device, it is made out of plastic and evidently, one can feel that right away. Although the tactile feedback and the touch sensitivity on the trackpad are fine-tuned, we felt the lack of richness, we ought to get on gaming laptops over $1000. However, it can still take up all the everyday essentials with ease without dropping a sweat.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD widescreen display and it is an IPS LED-backlit panel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What makes it unique though is its fast 144Hz refresh rate</span>. Meaning, the rapid refresh rate shortens the time it takes for frame rendering and provides gamers with an excellent in-game experience. This helps especially when you’re gaming or watching the high-quality video files.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3946" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-PH315-51-78NP-144Hz-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP) 144Hz Display Review" width="900" height="667" /></p>
<p>The display can get bright up to 300 nits and produces a decent 70% NTSC and 90% sRGB color gamut on the scale, making it good enough for content creators. We also played some 4K content on the laptop, and the details were very precise, that we could see every minute detail played.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops for Photo Editing with Most Color Accurate Display</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Overall, the display on the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) gaming laptop is one of its unique selling points and without a doubt, it is one of the best display-equipped mid-range gaming laptop available to buy right now.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the hardware of the device, Acer Predator Helios 300 comes with powerful innards, which makes it one of the latest in the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segment of mid-range gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by a latest 8th gen Intel Core i7-8750H hexa-core processor with clock frequency of up to 4.1GHz and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 video memory. The duo of this CPU and GPU makes it one of the most powerful and value for money gaming laptops available for the asking price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops</a> (8th Gen)</strong></em></div></div>
<p>For multitasking, the laptop has a huge 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of PCIe based NVMe SSD. Although this might not be sufficient to store huge data, be mindful, the SSD storage offered in this laptop is at least 4 times faster than that of the traditional HDD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_3947" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Hardware-and-Upgradability.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-78NP Hardware and Upgradability" width="800" height="546" /><p id="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>New Dual Fan Cooling System | Easy to upgrade RAM (Up to 32GB) and Storage</strong> <em>&#8211; Image taken from Dave Lee YouTube Channel</em></p></div>
<p>To the gamers rejoice, hardware on the Predator Helios 300 is quite easy to upgrade. The laptop&#8217;s back panel gives access to its two RAM slots one of which is empty and it also has an empty storage drive bay inside to upgrade its low storage with the hard drive or another SSD. The WiFi card is also easily accessible but we don&#8217;t think it needs to be changed as the Gigabit card that the laptop comes equipped with, works flawlessly and provides excellent WiFi reception.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming stationed laptop, we expect a lot of additional peripherals to be connected to the device. Accordingly, the Helios 300 comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C port which can support speeds of up to 5GBps. It also sports a USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports. There is an HDMI 2.0 port to plug in the additional display if needed. The HDMI port available comes with HDCP support. Apart from these, it also comes with a microSD card reader, an RJ45 Ethernet port, headphone jack, and a charging port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ports-and-Slots-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="800" height="367" /></p>
<p>The only disappointment here is its USB Type-C port which doesn&#8217;t support the Thunderbolt 3. We expected this year&#8217;s model with Thunderbolt 3 as the last year&#8217;s model didn&#8217;t had it. However, it isn&#8217;t a huge problem if you don&#8217;t plan to use the External GPU or other Thunderbolt accessories.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We spent a decent time gaming and doing other mediocre to demanding tasks on this laptop. The laptop stood up to the expectations and did well in terms of providing reliable performance and efficiency. We tested the laptop by <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rendering video</a> on the Adobe Premiere and even played some AAA games at high graphics settings. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop was able to handle our multitasking and gaming tests quite easily.</p>
<p>A gaming laptop is often discredited due to its heating issues but to our surprise, this year&#8217;s Acer Predator Helios 300 did well in terms of thermal management, despite having powerful CPU and GPU inside it. Thanks to its new all-metal dual AeroBlade fans and huge exhaust vents at the back, the laptop dissipates all the inside heat out and allows CPU and GPU to work at its full potential.</p>
<p>The data transfer speeds and superfast app loading speeds are yet another impressive aspects of this laptop. Its 256GB PCIe NVME SSD doesn&#8217;t offer adequate room, but it does help in reducing the bootup times and load times of games and other applications.</p>
<p>Speaking about the benchmarks, we ran a couple of benchmark tests on the laptop to find out its actual potential. Accordingly, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (with i7-8750H and GTX 1060) scored a good P13214 on the 3DMark 11 and a 19800 on multi-core and 4560 on single-core tests via Geekbench 4 64-bit. These scores are on par with most of the other offerings in the segment which makes the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) again king of the mid-range gaming laptops segment.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>All credits to the powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics baked in, the Helios 300 does deliver exceptionally well-performance for the mid-range gaming stationed laptop. We had a good time playing games on it and even at the highest graphics settings, laptop managed to deliver the respectable framerates. However, the fans get quite vocal while gaming and its battery lasted for just 58 minutes in our gaming tests.</p>

<p>The laptop also supports virtual reality, but GTX 1060 isn&#8217;t the best GPU you can get for the VR related tasks. We tested its VR capabilities by playing some VR games, and the laptop managed to run all of them. However, the experience wasn&#8217;t the smoothest and GPU did felt a bit underpowered for VR. But, the GPU is overclockable and overclocking does reduce the lag up to an extent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Like the last year&#8217;s model, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 also comes with the same dual stereo speakers located on the bottom front of the laptop. They are backed by the Acer’s proprietary Acer TruHarmony audio tech and Dolby Audio premium, which claims to enhance the audio quality. However, the audio isn&#8217;t the loudest and its sound gets suppressed due to the bad placement of speakers.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#b3b3b3;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#cdcdcd;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You May Like to Check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life on the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is definitely not the main selling point as it comes with the same 4-cell Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery that we saw in the last year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the laptop can provide up to 7 hours of continuous usage, during our real-time usage, we managed to sustain the battery for close to 4 hours with normal usage. However, while gaming the battery life dropped to a mere 58 minutes which is tad disappointment and less as per the gaming laptop&#8217;s standards of 2018. Moreover, it takes up to two and a half hours to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>So, battery on the new Predator Helios 300 is another thing after design, Acer has used to cut manufacturing costs, and that can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If one is looking for a powerful mid-range gaming laptop, then the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is our top pick right now. It checks a lot of right boxes with its segment first 144Hz display, powerful and latest hardware, and a rather old yet good built chassis. However, a bit heavy form factor, small battery and a 256GB of SSD might be a bit of concern for few. But it&#8217;s hard to find an alternative to this laptop, especially for the price that it comes.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15 comes with standard design, which although isn’t ground-breaking in terms of looks, but does give a solid look and feel.</p>
<p>The overall build quality and the chassis made is evidently a considerable improvement over the previously launched Pavilion series of notebooks by the company and comes with a toughed rigidity. The laptop’s edges and corners are stronger, sharper, and well-defined with better finish. Thanks to the improvised look and feel, the laptop feels far more aesthetic and versatile.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3678" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop - Design" width="750" height="484" /></p>
<p>The laptop has been designed and engineered considering the everyday usage. The laptop’s lid lifts the rear base of the laptop for the air flow, which maintains the laptop’s temperature. The display can be tilted to a maximum of <em>150 degrees</em>, which will suffice most of the regular users. Keyboard, trackpad, ports, and other connectivity slots are neatly recessed and are properly placed on the laptop. Both the edges consistently house the ports and other connectivity options.</p>
<p>Dimension wise, the laptop measures 9.93 x 14.88 x 0.95 inches, which is pretty much the norm in a 15-inch laptop. The laptop however, weighs just <strong>4 pounds</strong> which makes it ideal for daily commuters like college students and business people. On an overall, comparative note, the laptop’s dimension and weight are not much different than that of the other notebooks in the segment.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr laptop sports a 15.6-inch diagonal Full HD display. The display comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels and the panel on the device is an IPS WLED-backlit enabled one.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3679" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15 Gaming Laptop - Display Review" width="843" height="633" /></p>
<p>The 1080p IPS display works fine on most of the occasions. It does provide good vibrant color reproduction along with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">178-degree of wide-viewing angles</span>. However, we felt the display tended to be a bit grainy, which could take out the fun while playing games or watching videos at higher resolutions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Laptops with Most Color-Accurate Displays for Photo Editing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, the contrast levels on the laptop, were also a bit behind the competition. The color temperature on the laptop is not overly cool nor is very warm, which is a good thing. It has the right balance of color, which will suffice most of the gamers, and regular users. Backlit is subtle and can provide enough thrust for daylight viewing.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Pavilion Power packs in some robust and powerful innards for the asking price. Speaking about the hardware and specifications, the device packs in a latest 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor. The processor of the device comes with a default clock speed of  2.8GHz, which can go up to 3.8GHz in full throttle.</p>

<p>For multitasking and handling applications, the laptop comes with a 16GB of DDR4 SDRAM. The latest and the spacious 16GB of RAM ensures smoother and efficient performance at faster speeds. For the storage, the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of Serial ATA hard disk drive. The device also comes with a 128GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 solid-state drive. The read and write speeds of SSD are excellent and hard drive used on the laptop is also faster with 7200RPM speed.</p>
<p>As far as graphics are concerned, the laptop comes with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU with 4GB of DDR5 VRAM. So, from specs sheet the laptop looks pretty good but how&#8217;s the real-life performance? More on that later.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr series comes with an all new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full-size island-style chiclet keyboard</span>. The keyboard is more rigid, and provides better tactile feedback. Although the keys are plastic built, they come with a right concave structure, making typing easy and effective. The keyboard is backlit enabled which comes quite handy.</p>

<p>There are no separate fancy colors for WASD keys though, but that&#8217;s what makes this HP pavilion laptop stand out. Being a professional looking device, this laptop is beast inside and hence, the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best all-purpose laptop in $1000 price range</a> with perfect mixture of work and play.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3680" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-Keyboard-and-Toucpad-review.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="600" height="557" /></p>
<p>The touchpad on the device is also very spacious and comes with a proper surface area to suffice all the gestures and inputs. Moreover, it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chrome-trimmed trackpad</span>, giving it a rich feel while using.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15 comes with an <strong>integrated 720p HD web camera</strong>. The device’s camera can aid in video callings but cannot suffice someone who will use this as a means of capturing images. Although the device can capture images, the results might be a tad disappointing. There is evident visual noise in the images and they appear to be a bit blurry. However, the image gets adjusted quite well to the frame, and the camera’s reception rates are acceptable.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with all the set of ports and input slots, one would expect from a laptop. It comes with a pair of USB 3.1 Gen 1 Ports, an audio jack and kensington lock on left hand side and on right hand side there is one USB Type-C 3.1 Gen 1 port, one USB 3.1 Gen 1 port, RJ-45 port, an HDMI port, and a media card reader.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3681 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="1500" height="570" /></p>
<p>The ports selection on the laptop is very good and you would never run out of ports with this laptop but we think that the ports are aligned slightly close to each other and that might be problematic while connecting thumb drives to adjacent USB ports.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr laptop runs Windows 10 out of the box which is pretty much a norm, when it comes to gaming-stationed laptops. It has a large application market, and an even larger user base, making it an ideal choice for every gaming laptop.</p>
<p>As far as bloatware is concerned, the HP Pavilion Power 15 does come with some softwares pre-installed but some of them are useful. However, they can be uninstalled pretty easily and you can enjoy pure Windows experience with this laptop.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Thanks to the stellar set of specifications, the laptop offers, the performance on this device is not a compromise by any means. That said, the device delivers, powerful performance and can keeps up with all the multitasking demands of the users.</p>
<p>We tested the laptop in its full throttle by throwing multiple heavy applications at it. Thankfully, the laptop handled multiple apps exceptionally well. We were watching 4K content on the laptop, with multiple applications including benchmarks, chrome with almost 15 tabs open, and more, to which the laptop responded really well.</p>

<p>We did not had any issue in using the laptop as the primary work machine. The spacious keyboard and the trackpad helped us stay productive with the works. All the connectivity options provided with the laptop worked like a charm with no hassles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3682 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop Review - Gaming performance" width="700" height="455" /></p>
<p>We ran a couple of benchmarking tests to determine the power and performance of the device. The laptop gave very adequate benchmarking scores, easily topping the lists of most of the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other gaming laptops under $1000</a>.</p>
<p>We also did a couple of other performance tests including the data transfer rate tests, to which the laptop gave amazing results. Thanks to its combination of HDD+SSD, the device was able to achieve very good data transfer rates.</p>
<h4>Gaming Performance</h4>
<p>As far as the gaming on this HP Pavilion is concerned, the integrated <strong>4GB of GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 TI graphics coprocessor</strong> is a show-stealer here.</p>
<p>Being a primarily gaming-stationed laptop, the HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr laptop can handle almost all the modern games with ease even with the graphics set to mid-high level settings. To test its 3D rendering strength, we ran 3D Mark on the device, and the laptop scored a decent <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8800 points</span></strong>.</p>
<p>However, do not expect the buttery smooth gaming experience from demanding games at highest graphics settings. So on a conclusive note, users will be satisfied with the gaming performance of the device, if they keep their expectations in check. We played a couple of modern games including the GTA V on highest graphic mode and the laptop did well.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15’s speakers aren’t very powerful. But, they are subtle enough to give a good audio and listening experience. The device comes with dual Speakers, which are internally tuned by <em><strong>B&amp;O PLAY</strong></em> for better audio output. Moreover, the laptop comes with the company’s proprietary <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HP Audio Boost technology</span> for better audio at various presets.</p>
<p>As far as video experience is concerned, the laptop’s full HD display can handle almost all the content you throw at it. Be it 4K, UHD, Full HD, or HD, we had good time watching video content on the laptop. But, as we mentioned earlier the display is bit grainy and it isn&#8217;t the brightest to use easily in the daylight conditions.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The company claimed that the laptop can provide a battery backup of up to 11 hours on a single charge, which is very huge for any gaming laptop. However, when we put the laptop to test, it provided us an endurance period of about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7-8 hours on a single charge</span></strong>, which is still pretty commendable for a gaming laptop. The device is powered by a lithium-ion polymer battery, which <em>takes just 1 hour for a full charge from 0 to 100</em> which is again an added advantage of this laptop. So, battery life is where this laptop shines and stands out in the segment and we would like to applaud HP for that.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3135 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HP-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop Review" width="550" height="359" /></p>
<p>HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr is unarguably one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best value-for-money gaming laptop in sub-$1000 segment</strong></span>. The laptop has got able hardware paired with decent specs. Although the laptop lags slightly behind the competition in terms of display quality and audio output, its performance, built, and battery life makes it a very worthy buy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS ROG has been playing a prominent role in the gaming laptops arena since a while now. The brand is very well known to provide powerful gaming laptops under its ROG (Republic Of Gamers) series in various budget segments. Accordingly, our current contender, the ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD is a close to $1000 gaming laptop, which not only looks attractive but also provides an attractive set of features and specifications.</p>
<p>Although you won&#8217;t be getting a ground staggering gaming beast at this point, but you definitely get quite a lot more than what you pay for. The laptop is also one of the very first laptops from the ASUS ROG series to come with an RGB-backlit keyboard, which gives an absolute gaming hue to the laptop. All these styling aspects and powerful configuration of the laptop, made us pick this for our review, and here is what we think of it:</p>

<p>Asus ROG Strix GL553VD comes in a furious looking blend of black and orange coloured chassis, which gives it all the necessary gaming look, one would expect from a gaming laptop. The laptop is made up of all plastic chassis, which, however, feels of superior quality and feels sturdy. The laptop’s lid sports a pair of orange strips running across the ROG logo, which gives a slightly different look from its predecessors. The bottom of the laptop comes with rubber feet, to give an extra grip even at inclined and smooth surfaces.</p>

The laptop measures just like any of the usual 15.6-inch laptop in the market. As per the measurements, the laptop isn&#8217;t heavy or bulky to carry around. However, that said, it&#8217;s not pretty light either.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD - Thinness" width="600" height="622" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-289x300.jpg 289w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-48x50.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking about the alignment of ports on the laptop, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, and a couple of USB 3.0 ports, a USB type-C port, and a headphone jack on the left end. Towards the right end, it comes with a single USB 2.0 port, a DVD drive, and a locking slot. The laptop comes with an SD card reader towards the lower end of the keyboard and is located just beneath the palm rest.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the GL553VD is a completely redesigned one. It is now a RGB lighting keyboard which Asus calls it as a <em>Aura lighting keyboard</em>. The lights on the keyboard can be customised through the pre-installed Asus keyboard color adjustment software. As far as typing is concerned, the keys on keyboard are spacious and gives very nice tactile feedback while typing. The key travel distance is also 2.5mm which is standard and good for the &#8220;gaming laptop&#8217;s keyboard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Overall, the all-matte black finish on the laptop makes this laptop look extremely stylish and thanks to its well-built ergonomics, the laptop feels easy to hold and carry around.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD gaming laptop sports a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS-like display panel and comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. The laptop comes with a wide view of 178 degrees, which we felt was pretty good in the real time usage. Moreover, the panel gets equipped with a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is also a good aspect for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2100" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-image-2100 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Display Review" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-caption-text">15.6 Inch Full HD Matte Finish 178 Degree Wide View Display</p></div>
<p>The blacks on the display were punchy, and almost all the colours were pretty accurate. The display on the laptop has got the right amount of contrasts, one would be needing in gaming and other viewing experiences. The best part about the display we felt during the review was the colour consistency which was pretty uniform even from extreme positions. And although the laptop doesn&#8217;t come with an anti-glare coating, it does resist reflections and glare on the screen. These aspects of the display qualifies this <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/">laptop for photo editing</a> and also for other works where color accuracy of the display is  important.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a 17-inch variant of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL753VD</em> which comes with exactly the same specs as this laptop but it sports a bigger 17.3 inch display. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a bigger laptop to play games then you can go with GL753VD, which will cost you around $30 bucks more than the current model. | <a title="Recommended Laptop Retailer - Amazon.com" href="http://amzn.to/2mcYSJj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL753VD 17.3 Inch Gaming Laptop</strong></em></a>.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Now with all that said about the design and display of this power-packed gaming laptop, let&#8217;s dive into the hardware specifications of the Strix GL553VD. Speaking about the innards of this laptop, the ASUS ROG Strix comes with an equally powerful set of hardware configuration. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th gen intel core i7 processor paired with an abundant 16GB of RAM. The quad-core i7 kaby lake processor is clocked at 2.8GHz and can turbo boost up to 3.8GHz, making sure that, multiple demanding applications run on the laptop with ease. Graphics on the laptop are bolstered and are handled really well by newer Pascal based NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card.</p>
<div id="attachment_2101" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-image-2101 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD Hardware Review" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-300x180.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-50x30.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-caption-text">Next-Generation Performance | New NVidia GeForce GTX Pascal Based Graphics &amp; Kaby Lake CPU</p></div>
<p>As far as the storage on the laptop is concerned, it is backed by a 1TB of HDD with a speed of 7200RPM. The laptop also comes with a DVD drive to read and write CD/DVDs. Upgrading this laptop is also fairly easy. The RAM is easily accessible and it can be upgraded up to 32GB. Even storage drive of this laptop can be upgraded but that is the little complicated process and you may void the warranty if you do this on your own.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another model of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL553VE</em> which has slightly more powerful GPU and faster SSD storage. To be accurate, it has powerful NVidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti Graphics and it offers 1TB of 7200RPM hard drive and an extra 256GB of SSD storage which vastly improves the gaming performance of the laptop. Of-course, this added performance will come by spending some extra money! | <strong><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2naefqf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL553VE Gaming Laptop</em></a></strong>.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<div id="attachment_2102" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-image-2102 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD - Webcam" width="600" height="247" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-300x124.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-caption-text">With HD Webcam You Can Stream Your Game Play with Friends or on YouTube</p></div>
<p>We never focus a primary light on this aspect of a laptop, especially if it is a gaming-stationed one. However, we understand that the webcam on a laptop should be serviceable for occasional video calls. Thankfully, the 720p camera on the Strix manages to take decent images and is pretty serviceable for video calls. However, the images captured are not very sharp and tends to get blurry at times. The image adjusts quickly on the screen, which we felt was very good for video calling.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<div id="attachment_2104" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-image-2104 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Ports &amp; Slots" width="700" height="209" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots.jpg 700w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-300x90.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-610x182.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-600x179.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-caption-text">Reversible USB Type-C Port with Hyper Fast Data Transfer Speeds</p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a long list of ports and connectivity options to accommodate additional peripherals (gaming accessories). It sports a couple of USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port. In addition to that, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, a <strong>USB Type-C port</strong>, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Unlike most of the current laptops, it comes with a DVD drive, which read/writes data from DVDs and CDs. The laptop also houses an SD card slot to transfer files back and forth between memory card and laptop.</p>
<h4>Software</h4>
<p>Asus has preloaded its Strix laptop with the right fusion of gaming beneficiary software, which is high on productivity and gaming aspects. The laptop comes with Windows 10 preloaded on the software front, and also comes equipped with the ASUS&#8217;s proprietary ROG gaming centre.</p>
<p>This gives games a whole new level of overall performance increase and also keeps the laptop’s temperature in control even after heavy gaming. The ROG gaming centre properly utilises the CPU and GPU performances and provides the most of the both. In addition to this, this laptop also includes alternatives to boost up the exhaust speeds and disable the Windows key during gaming.</p>
<p>The laptop comes preloaded with almost all the Windows 10 apps and features and is, therefore, an equally able laptop in terms of overall productivity.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD comes with a fully-loaded future-proof set of specifications and hardware. So evidently, we expect top class performance from the laptop. We put this laptop to test, to check out whether it can really provide us with the performance we expect from a gaming beast of this calibre. And here is what we found:</p>
<p>The laptop runs absolutely smooth and does a great job in multitasking. During our entire review, we never faced any performance related hiccups, and the laptop was able to handle almost everything we threw at it. Thanks to its latest 7th gen Intel core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM, the Strix delivers impeccable performance. We multitasked the laptop with Chrome running around 15 tabs simultaneously, a 4K video running in the background, a benchmarking app loaded and was connected to WiFI all the time. The laptop was able to handle them all with ease.</p>
<p>For the overall performance of the laptop, we tested it with Geekbench 3, in which the laptop notched a score of 14,120, which is absolutely great for a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptop priced $1000</a>. As far as the gaming is concerned, the in-house 4GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU is a show-stealer here. The laptop can handle almost all the modern games even the graphics set to maximum. However, you&#8217;ll feel that smooth lag-free gaming with more than 35-40fps when you play them with graphics set to medium. We played GTA V on high graphics mode and the laptop although responded very well to the games, we personally felt that it did a better job when graphics were set to medium.</p>
<p>All that said, The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD unarguably provides a beastly performance for the asking price.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop easily handled almost all formats of video content. We tested it with 4K, Full HD, and HD videos and the Strix GL553VD handled them all with ease. However, it was the audio quality, which failed to reach our expectations. The audio felt muffled at times and was not detailed on the notes. At maximum volume, we felt a crackling like sounds, which disappointed us.</p>
<div id="attachment_2106" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106" class="wp-image-2106 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review.jpg" alt="Asus GL553VD Speakers Review" width="750" height="517" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-300x207.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-610x420.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-600x414.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106" class="wp-caption-text">Loud Speakers for Immersive In-Game Audio</p></div>
<p>Audio on the laptop is also a bit thin and weak when compared to its rivals in the price segment. However, the sound output on the laptop is still serviceable. Thanks to the preinstalled ICEpower AudioWizard software programs tuning audio was easy.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Like most of the gaming laptops these days, ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD also comes with a pretty mediocre battery life, and you&#8217;ll have to carry your power adapter if you take Strix anywhere out. The laptop is powered by a non-removable 4-cells 48 WHr battery, which lasted for just over 4 hours for us on our usage. This included casual web browsing, online videos streaming, few benchmarking apps, and some gaming. The laptop takes around 3 hours to get fully charged from 0 to 100. All in all, the battery backup of this laptops isn&#8217;t groundbreaking and is strictly average. We seriously felt this was an area the laptop was lagging behind its rivals to an extent.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2041 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD Gaming Laptop Full In depth Review" width="500" height="365" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000.jpg 500w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000-300x219.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Keeping it very simple, the Asus ROG Strix GL553VD is a very attractive looking gaming laptop with punchy aesthetics and powerful hardware. The laptop also provides very good performance and gaming experience. The only aspects which are a let down in this laptop are its battery life and audio output. However, on an overall note, the laptop is a complete show stealer, when compared to its rivals and is, therefore, our choice of gaming laptop if your budget is around $1000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS was one of the very first brands among all the traditional laptop makers, to step into the gaming arena and challenge the pioneers like MSI and Alienware series of laptops. It all started with the ROG (Republic of Gamers) series of laptops from ASUS, which was not only priced competitively but was also a very good all-around performer. Soon after the company started to earn fame and reputation in the gaming arena, it started to release a series of laptops with the primary emphasis on gaming to attract a large audience.</p>
<p>Our current laptop, the ASUS FX502VM Gaming Laptop is one among the newly launched gaming series of laptop from ASUS, which is now one of the most selling gaming laptops at around $1000. The laptop does pack in some interesting set of specifications and also packs in a lot of additional features. We were initially surprised to hear about the intelligent thermal design and several other futuristic features of the laptop and therefore, decided to have a look at it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1851" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Asus FX502VM 15.6 Gaming Laptop" width="750" height="519" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-300x208.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-610x422.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-600x415.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.6-Gaming-Laptop-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Here is our take on the ASUS FX502VM-AH51, so let’s just quickly drill down to the review.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM looks thick and hefty right from the very first look. However, the laptop is very finely engineered and ergonomically built. The laptop comes with a curved chassis as seen on the ROG series with imposed curves with an ASUS logo imposed on the lid. The laptop is thick at the centre and gradually gets narrower towards the edges.</p>
<div id="attachment_1852" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-image-1852 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png" alt="Asus FX502VM Gaming Laptop - Dimensions" width="469" height="550" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png 469w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-256x300.png 256w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-43x50.png 43w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t see gaming laptops this thin more often!</p></div>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15.4 x 10.5 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weights around 4.9 pounds, which although isn&#8217;t that hefty for a gaming laptop, still feels a little cumbersome to carry around.</p>
<p>Both the sides of the laptop are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The laptop comes in matte finished colour giving a perfect gaming hue to the users. As soon as you open the lid, you see a very aggressive looking futuristic keyboard. The keyboard on the laptop comes with red backlit keys, which adapts a theme according to the game we play. Moreover, the trackpad on the laptop is also spaciously arranged in the body, giving it a perfect ease of usage.</p>

<p>All in all, the ASUS FX502VM comes with a finely engineered futuristic design. The laptop feels really sturdy but is, unfortunately, slightly heavy to carry around.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Our ASUS FX502VM features a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. With these numbers kept in mind, it is quite vibrant enough for movies and games. As soon as we started testing out the laptop, we played some 4K content on it, to which the laptop’s display responded really well. When watching a 4K trailer of injustice: Gods among us, all the colours popped up really well with high colour gamut. Moreover, the viewing angles on the laptop are also really great and can easily cover over 160-degrees without getting smudged.</p>
<p>Our lab tests also proved the ASUS FX502VM’s impressive colour performance. The laptop managed to produce 184.7 percent of the sRGB colour gamut, which is by far one of the best we measured. That not only means that this display is bright and colourful, but also means that it is accurate than most of its rivals in the price segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_1855" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-image-1855 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Display" width="780" height="502" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png 780w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-300x193.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-768x494.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-610x393.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-600x386.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-caption-text">15 Inch Display with Full HD Resolution, 100% sRGB and Wide Viewing Angles.</p></div>
<p>During our entire review and usage, we never ever felt that the display on the ASUS FX502VM was even a bit dim. It is bright, vivid, colourful, and wide. As far as the benchmarking numbers are concerned, ASUS’s notebook managed to register an average brightness of 289 nits on our light meter, which is an edging out figure for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware on ASUS FX502VM: It is powered by a sixth generation gaming-centric Intel core i5-6300HQ mobile processor clocked at 2.3GHz. For multitasking, the processor is paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM. The laptop comes with thermal cooling technology, and thus makes use of dual cooling fans, to prevent the innards getting warm even under heavy usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_1856" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1856" class="wp-image-1856 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM.jpg" alt="Intelligent Thermal Cooling on Asus FX502VM 15 Inch Gaming Laptop" width="750" height="586" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-300x234.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-610x477.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-600x469.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1856" class="wp-caption-text">Intelligent Thermal Design &#8211; Hyper cool duo-copper cooling system keeps laptop always at comfortable temperature.</p></div>
<p>As far as storage on the laptop is concerned, it comes with a 1TB of hard disk, with an RPM of 7200. This not only ensures faster data transfers but also ensures of being a reliable data storage medium. Graphics on the laptop are handled by NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics coprocessor with a dedicated DDR5 memory of 3GB. This is the new Pascal architecture based GPU from NVidia. Hence, Asus FX502VM is a VR Ready gaming laptop and it can run all 360° games, videos and other VR content without any problems.</p>
<p>ASUS FX502 has a specially-designed chiclet gaming keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys that offer the users a large 1.6mm of travel distance. Greater the travel distance, better is the tactile feedback for keystrokes. In addition to that, the laptop also features highlighted WASD keys for user convenience. The keyboard on this laptop is undoubtedly best for gaming, but apart from that it can also be used by <a title="Top Recommended Laptops for College for Every Budget" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students for college</a> or by <a title="The Best Laptops for Computer Programmers for Coding/Programming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers for coding</a> and playing games.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The laptop sports an HD Webcam on top of the display. The camera on this laptop is not the best you get at this budget but is adequate enough to meet the basic requirements of a typical laptop’s webcam. Yes, you can make Skype calls, and can even take few selfies during your leisure. On top of that, there is nothing much to be discussed in this section.</p>
<h4>Ports</h4>
<p>ASUS FX502VM crams a number of useful and productively usable ports onto its small frame. On the left side, you&#8217;ll find a proprietary power port, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI-out, an audio jack, 1x mini Display Port, and a microSD card reader.</p>
<div id="attachment_1858" style="width: 780px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1858" class="wp-image-1858 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Asus FX502VM 15.3-Inch Affordable Gaming Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="770" height="618" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 770w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-300x241.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-768x616.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-610x490.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-600x482.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-15.3-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1858" class="wp-caption-text">Extensive connectivity options on Asus FX502VM-AH51 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</p></div>
<p>The right side houses two USB 2.0 ports, which are more than good enough for most peripherals you might attach, but we wish there was another USB 3.0 so we could take advantage of the <a title="Shop External Hard Drives on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2htYAfG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fastest external hard drives available in market</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS FX502VM runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and is naturally, one of the flexible operating systems for laptops. The Windows 10, is not just good at UI but is also very productive. It has millions of apps, compatible with it and provides a deeper level of customizations to its users. Apart from all the standard lineup of Windows 10 applications and software, the ASUS FX502VM also packs in some of the ASUS’s proprietary applications of security and productivity.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with 1-year Accidental Damage Protection along with 30 days of Zero Bright Dot Guarantee, which is one of the most comprehensive coverages available for laptops. This gives you protection against accidental drops, spills and electrical surges of the laptop.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The laptop does deliver an outstanding performance in its class. Thanks to an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of hard disk drive, the laptop is surely a power-packed performer.</p>

<p>We personally feel that the laptop could have been even better if it had an SSD drive instead of HDD. During our usage, the laptop’s hard drive was reading data at 145MB/s and was writing at 135MB/s, so while nowhere near as fast as the SSD it&#8217;s clearly a decent 7200rpm model. Keeping the hard drive details aside, the laptop being a powerful gaming performer, can handle all the general daily essentials with ease. During our usage, we ran a couple of RAM consuming benchmarks, brewer with more than 15 tabs opened, music playing in the background, with a high-end game running in the background. The laptop was handling multitasking with ease and is a powerful, stable, and reliable daily performer.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, we can accolade the ASUS FX502VM for being a gaming-stationed laptop and to the fact that it is stuffed with the Nvidia’s latest GTX 1060 GPU (the main reason to get excited about this laptop). The laptop was able to handle Alien Isolation with all settings maxed out and resolution set to 1080p at an average 75fps. However, the laptop did face few hiccups at 188fps wherein the visuals dropped slightly.</p>
<p>We installed a long list of high-end games on this laptop, thanks to its massive 1TB of hard drive. We tested the laptop with our all time favourite The Witcher III, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm. The best part, the laptop was able to handle all these games with ease even with the graphics set to max. Surely, the laptop stands in its words- The best gaming laptop at the budget. So for all the gaming lovers out there who are slightly tight on budget, this is probably the best you can get.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, it is essential for the ASUS FX502VM to accommodate powerful, detailed, and loud stereo output. During our usage, we found the speakers are excellent and hold their ground. As we always mention, multimedia is one of the most vital aspects of any laptop and our contender is packed with dual HD stereo speakers with DTS tech-enabled, which does the task of providing punchy audio pretty well.</p>

<p>We tested the speakers with bass heavy punchy tracks such as no church in the west and power bass, to which the speakers on the laptop responded really well. We also tested the laptop with treble based cleaner tracks, to which it responded well again. The laptop can play all sorts of HD content including 4K with ease. After all, this packs in the latest Nvidia’s GTX 1060!</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM is juiced using a 4-cell Lithium-ion battery. After all our usage, all we can say is the laptop does provide an outstanding battery backup. That said, being a gaming-stationed laptop, we honestly, didn&#8217;t expect much from it. The laptop lasted for just over 4 hours under continuous gaming, which is still a decent backup for a laptop with this configuration and features. However, if you aren&#8217;t gaming continuously you can expect slightly better battery backup. The laptop can be charged fully from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Bottom line: <em>Are you a hardcore gamer but slightly tight on budget? Go for it blindfolded!</em></h3>
<p>With a price tag of around $1250, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASUS FX502VM 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</span> is undoubtedly our first choice, if you need a power-packed gaming machine. Moreover, there aren&#8217;t many laptops at this price point which is primarily meant for gaming. Although the laptop is not as powerful as the ASUS’s flagship ROG series of laptops or the MSI’s dominators, it still is a very efficient, reliable, and powerful all-round performer.</p>
