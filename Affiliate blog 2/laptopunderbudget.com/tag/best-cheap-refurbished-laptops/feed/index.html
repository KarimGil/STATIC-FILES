										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laptops under $100? Do they really exist?&nbsp;The answer is YES! There are few laptop manufacturers who are offering laptops for the price as low as 100 dollars. But, finding a best cheap laptop isn&#8217;t an easy task as there are very&nbsp;few &#8220;box packed new laptops&#8221; available in this price range so buying a refurbished laptop is the only way to crack a deal here.

<p>Technology is improving every day and to cope up with all the latest technologies in the market, laptop manufacturers launch new laptop models with minor improvements to its predecessor laptops.

Well if we talk about <strong>buying the laptops under $100 budget</strong> specifically then you will hardly find any new laptops in this price range because one hundred&nbsp;dollars isn&#8217;t enough to buy a device like a laptop. But still, there&nbsp;are few refurbished laptops to buy under $100 which will&nbsp;let you do&nbsp;basic works like editing documents, making presentations, surfing the internet and other low performance requiring&nbsp;works. Yes, we will have a look at the list of best cheap laptops in a while&nbsp;but before that&#8230;</p>
