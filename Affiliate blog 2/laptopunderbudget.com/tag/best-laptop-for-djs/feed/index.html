										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of people believe that highly specced laptops are good for music production. Well, they are right. High-performance hardware is must to run the DAW and djing software efficiently but not all high-end laptops have what it takes to be a good music production laptop. So, what exactly constitutes to an ideal laptop for music recording and DJing? And, considering the fact that most professional music producers use MacBook for their work, should you consider spending your money on a costly MacBook or can a windows machine suffice your needs?</p>
<p>To answer all your questions, here is a complete guide on laptops for music production which will help you to make an informed purchase of your next laptop for making music.</p>
<p><span id="more-3410"></span></p>
<p>First things first, buying a laptop for music production is not an easy task. You have to be very picky with the hardware as DAW software are resource-demanding, and you also have to take care of various other things such as the laptop&#8217;s fans noise, the available number of ports, and more. We will be talking about all these important aspects of a music production laptop later in this guide but before that let&#8217;s conclude:</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">Should you buy a MacBook or Windows Laptop for Music Production?</h4>
<hr>
<p>Well, which laptop to buy for music production will mostly depend upon the DAW software you use and of course the amount you are willing to spend on a new laptop.</p>
<p>If you can shed a couple of thousand bucks on your new laptop then definitely top of the line <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2MHTr72" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Pro with touch bar</a> is the best choice for music production right now as it offers a very stable performance, and it is also fairly easy to travel with, which is very important if you&#8217;re into DJing.</p>
<p>But, if you&#8217;re on a budget, then Windows laptops are also an excellent choice for making music. In fact, for the price of an entry-level MacBook Pro, you can buy a pretty beefy specced Windows laptop which can run even the most demanding DAW and djing softwares smoothly.</p>
<p>However, refinement and robustness of Windows is not as good as macOS. macOS is perfectly optimized to synchronize and work with the hardware on MacBooks, and that&#8217;s the reason why even older MacBook Pros still excels in performance than most of the new Windows laptops. But, there are few excellent Windows laptops which give MacBook Pro a good run for the money (you&#8217;ll find them in the list of our most recommended laptops for music production below).</p>
<p>Apart from this, the DAW software you use is also an essential thing to consider before you choose the operating system of your laptop. Make sure to check the DAW software you want to use for making music supports the operating system you choose for your laptop. This might be a silly point to make, but there are few novice and beginners who end up buying Windows laptop thinking that they will be able to use Logic Pro X on it. The Logic Pro X is available for macOS only so you&#8217;ll have to purchase the MacBook to use it.</p>
<p>So, research properly about the DAW software and other tools you want to use before deciding the operating system of your laptop for music production.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the crucial things to take care of while deciding whether you should buy a MacBook or Windows laptop for your music production work. If you are new to any of these operating systems, then I would recommend you to refer some articles related to these operating systems, or you can check out the videos on YouTube to get the better idea of it.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, if you plan to go with the macOS, then it&#8217;s easy you can buy the MacBook Pro model that suits your budget and requirements. But, if you choose Windows, then there are tons of different Windows laptops available in the market and to find the best laptop that suits all your recording and music production requirements is no less than a herculean task.</p>
<p>So, to help you out, our team of laptop experts tested a lot of different laptop models by running DAW and DJing softwares on them and cherry-picked some of the best ones that performed well in our tests of music recording, mixing and djing.</p>
<p>But, before we check out those shortlisted laptops for music production, let&#8217;s discuss all the essential things that one needs to check on a laptop to make it ideal for recording and making music. It will be helpful when you want to buy any laptop which is not present in our list and based upon the guidelines you can do your research and find your laptop for music production or DJing on your own.</p>

<hr>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3608" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/choosing-specs-for-music-production-laptop.jpg" alt="choosing specs for music production laptop" width="650" height="428"></p>
<p>Hardware is one of the most crucial things to check in the laptop for music production, regardless of you need it for DJing or just producing the music in your studio.</p>
<p>Choosing the hardware of your laptop shouldn&#8217;t be that hard if you already know what DAW software you&#8217;ll use to make music. Just check the recommended hardware to run the DAW software you want to use and buy the laptop with same hardware specifications or if your budget allows, get the laptop with more powerful hardware than recommended, it will future-proof your device.</p>
<p>But, if you&#8217;re unsure about the DAW software and want to buy the laptop which could let you use any DAW software then below is an ideal configuration to look for in a laptop for music production and recording purposes.</p>
<h5><strong>Powerful multi-core processor</strong></h5>
<p>Always pick the laptop with quad-core or hexa-core processor for music production because extra cores help to render the music files faster. Of course, the best processor to pick will be Intel&#8217;s new hexa-core i7 processor (i7-8750H or i7-9750H) if you&#8217;re not on a budget, but if you&#8217;re looking for a budget laptop for music production, then Intel&#8217;s quad-core i5 processor is also a fairly decent choice. You can check out our guides on&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel Core i7 laptops</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel Core i5 laptops</a> to find the best Intel multi-core processor powered laptops.</p>
<p>You can also buy an AMD powered laptops, in fact, the new Ryzen mobile CPU looks very promising in terms of performance, but you might have to struggle a bit to find the right drivers for your midi controller and other audio peripherals.</p>
<h5><strong>More than 8GB of RAM (16GB Recommended)</strong></h5>
<p>For basic music production works, 8GB of RAM is more than enough to run any DAW software, but if you use a lot of plugins and work with multiple tracks simultaneously then you&#8217;ll need a laptop with more RAM (16GB or even 32GB). Also, make sure that the laptop you buy has extra RAM slots so that you can upgrade the RAM in future.</p>
<h5><strong><del>Hard Drive</del> Solid State Drive</strong></h5>
<p>Solid state drive is highly recommended for the laptop which will be used for recording because SSDs don&#8217;t have any moving parts, so they stay quiet, and reading and writing speeds of SSDs are also far better than hard drives so booting of OS and launching of bulky DAW software will be lightning fast with SSDs.</p>
<p>As far as size is concerned, the 512GB SSD will be best considering the large size of DAW software, but if you&#8217;re on a budget, then you can buy the laptop with small sized SSD (256GB or 128GB) and use the external hard drive to store your other data.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re on an extreme budget and cannot afford the laptop with SSD for your music production work then&nbsp;make sure to buy the laptop with a 7200RPM hard drive. The 5400RPM hard drives are very slow and can reduce the overall speed of your computer despite powerful CPU or higher amount of RAM.</p>
<p>You can also buy the laptops with hybrid drives (<a title="What is hybrid drive or SSHD?" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SSHD</a>) for music production. They are faster than laptops with traditional hard drives and costs just a little extra.</p>
<h5><strong>Mediocre GPU</strong></h5>
<p>The integrated graphics on newer generation processors are so powerful that you no more need dedicated GPU in a laptop for music production but having a dedicated GPU will undeniably aid if you use graphics-heavy plugins with the DAW software. So, you don&#8217;t need a top of the line GPU for recording and making music but having an entry-level one from Nvidia like MX150 or an equivalent from AMD will definitely help to improve the overall performance of the laptop.</p>
<p>Well, if you are the one who would like to play all the latest games alongside music production, then you will need a better graphics backed laptop (with Nvidia GTX 1050 or 1060 GPU). You can check out our <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptop buying guides</a>; they will help you to buy the best laptop for music production and gaming for yourself.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e57f;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF99;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"></p>
<p><strong>Note &#8211;</strong> Dedicated GPUs come with its separate cooling fans, and when you do something intensive they run at pretty high speeds making a lot of noise, so if you want a laptop for music recording then laptops with powerful GPUs might not be the right choice unless you have a two-room recording setup.</p>
<p></div></div>
<p>Apart from hardware, other things such as the display, ports and slots, and of-course noise of CPU cooling fans are also very important things to check in the laptop which will be used for music production and DJing.</p>
<p>Starting with the display, we aren’t going to emphasize much on the resolution of the screen, we aren’t saying a music production laptop need to have a 2K or a 4K resolution display, but make sure that you have a clear, vivid, and large enough display to evidently see the music timelines and work accordingly. That said, make sure your laptop’s display comes with at least Full HD resolution.</p>
<p>As far as size is concerned, we&#8217;d suggest going with a <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">large sized laptop</a> (15 or 17-inch preferably) for the people who will be using their laptop mostly from the studio or any fixed place but for DJing, we think smaller <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13-inch</a> or <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14-inch laptop</a> will be an optimum size as DJs have to travel a lot and perform live at different places. Touchscreen would also be a very nice addition to the djing laptop.</p>
<p>The number of ports and input slots also plays a very vital role in choosing a music production laptop. Because, you’ll have to connect multiple devices such as microphones, amplifier, speakers, midi controllers, and more to make music. So make sure, the laptop you’re going to get have an abundant number of ports. On an optimal note, you can always use USB hubs and port extenders, to connect multiple devices to your laptop for music production.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, the laptop you buy for music production should have a very good thermal management system. The laptop should have large-enough vents to easily ventilate the inside heat, and fans of the laptop should also be as silent as possible so that its noise don&#8217;t hinder while recording audio.</p>
</div>

<p>So, these are the important things to check in a laptop which will be used for making music and DJing and believe us, finding the laptop with all the aforementioned aspects takes a lot of time. So, if you don&#8217;t want to baffle your mind by researching and sifting different laptop models then below is the list of our most recommended laptops for recording and making music which are tested by our team of laptop experts and proven to satisfy all the requirements of musicians and DJs.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro series of laptops are currently the market&#8217;s best and class-leading devices when it comes to music production. Although they can be used as a multipurpose laptop, they hold their strong points in music production and recording. The laptop comes with a solid set of hardware, which gives it all the necessary performing power and abilities to handle music production software smoothly. Under the hood, it has a latest 9th Gen 2.5GHz six-core Intel Core i7 processor with 12MB cache. The processor needs no introduction and is undeniably, an able and powerful processor. Moreover, it can turbo boost up to 4.5GHz under heavy usage. The device comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB of fast, secure, and ultra-efficient SSD storage. The laptop is also aided by a powerful <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AMD Radeon Pro 555x GPU</span> and automatic graphics switching Intel UHD Graphics 630 chipset for that extra punch of power when you want to edit your vacation pictures and videos.</p>
<p>Apart from the power and abilities of the MacBook Pro, what makes it best for music production is macOS. macOS, by default, comes with a standard set of editing tools, which are extremely useful for music producers and in addition to that you can also use <strong>Logic Pro X</strong> &#8211; one of the best DAW softwares available exclusively for Apple computers. Moreover, almost every popular DAW and music production software is available for macOS, making it the right machine to house all your music related applications and tools.</p>
<p>MacBook Pro is known to provide the highest level of power, performance, and efficiency needed to produce music without any lag or delay in the music recording, and rendering. On top of this, the device comes with excellent battery backup, which makes it an ideal choice for DJs who like to mix and produce music on-the-go and also for the students majoring in music for uninterrupted learning.</p>
<div id="attachment_3588" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3588" class="wp-image-3588 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro" width="700" height="452"><p id="caption-attachment-3588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Logic Pro X and Touch bar</strong> | <em>Image credits &#8211; Apple</em></p></div>
<p>This MacBook Pro model, in particular, comes with a <strong>Touch bar</strong> which can be used in multiple ways. Touch bar can come very handy to music producers while scrolling through the timeline and minimal to maximal tunings and tweakings. But, do note that the new MacBook Pro 15 comes with just four ThunderBolt USB Type-C ports. That said, to connect all your audio gear and peripherals, you&#8217;ll need USB Type-C hubs and dongles, and sadly Apple doesn&#8217;t include one in the box. This might be the biggest let down for most musicians and composers who wanted to buy the MacBook Pro but do note that there are hardly any laptops that can match the performance and reliability that MacBooks offer. And, that&#8217;s the reason why most professional music producers recommend and use MacBook Pro for making music and djing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several other variants of the MacBook Pro, which the users can choose from. All these variants although run on the same macOS, they come with a varied spec sheet, which ultimately decides their price.</p>

<p><strong>Apple&#8217;s 13&#8243; MacBook Pro</strong>, is an equally able work machine for music production that comes with a touch bar. The device comes with a 2.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD. The device comes with retina display and costs slightly less than the above-mentioned variant. | <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/31rSVNw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Check Price on Amazon</strong></em></a></p>
<p>The <strong>baseline MacBook Pro 13</strong> is also an excellent choice for recording and making music for those who are on a budget. It is available for about $1200, and it doesn&#8217;t come with touch bar and also gets a compromise on the number of ports, which might be a bit of concern. However, speaking about the specifications and other aspects, this device is equally able and comes with a 13-inch retina display, i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD. For those looking for an affordable MacBook for music production, this would be the best choice. | <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2FJZxLZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Check price on Amazon</strong></em></a></p></blockquote>

<h3>3. ASUS ZenBook UX331FA Ultrabook <span class="su-label su-label-type-info">For Music Students</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2WKCY6D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5623 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ASUS-ZenBook-13-UX331FA-AS51-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook UX331FA-AS51 - best laptop for music students" width="550" height="370"></a></p>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX331FA is yet another power-packed windows laptop and it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recommended most to the music students and DJs</span> as it&#8217;s an extremely lightweight machine, <strong>weighing just 2.5 pounds</strong>. However, its lightweight design is not the only reason to put it on this list; there&#8217;s a lot more. So, let&#8217;s discuss it in detail.</p>
<p>Starting with the display, the laptop sports a 13.3-inch Full HD display with wide 170-degree viewing angles which makes the screen easy to see while playing and recording audio from the guitar or any other musical instruments. Moreover, the screen also comes with an anti-glare coating which protects the eyes from strains while extended work sessions.</p>
<p>The laptop being a recently launched machine runs on latest Windows 10 OS out of the box and it packs powerful hardware inside to run most of the DAW and djing softwares with ease. It is powered by the latest 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8250U 1.6 GHz quad-core processor which comes with 6MB cache and can be throttled up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode. Storage on the device is managed by a fast and efficient 512GB SSD, which will suffice most of the audio affectionates demand. Multitasking and application handling, which acts as an essential aspect of any music production laptop is handled by an 8GB of RAM on this ASUS ZenBook. However, it doesn&#8217;t come with a dedicated GPU but its integrated Intel HD graphics does the needful to run the music production softwares smoothly.</p>
<p>For any laptop, meant for music production, the connectivity options must not be limited. Following the above maxim, the ASUS ZenBook UX331FA houses enough number of ports to connect all your audio equipment and other peripheral devices. Moreover, the device also comes with a <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fingerprint sensor</span></em>, which keeps all your produced music and other data secured.</p>
<p>The only drawback of this laptop is, in order to make this laptop slimmer and lightweight, ASUS has soldered all its parts on motherboard so you can&#8217;t update its RAM or add extra storage drive in this laptop. But, in our tests, the laptop performed quite exceptionally. And, that&#8217;s why we recommend the ASUS ZenBook UX331FA-AS51 laptop to the young DJs and musicians who are looking for a pocket-friendly ultrabook for making music.</p>

<p>The above mentioned ASUS ZenBook UX331FA is indeed the best laptop for students majoring in music, but it doesn&#8217;t come with a dedicated GPU so you can&#8217;t play newer games on it and it might also slow down when you use demanding plugins with DAW software. So, if you would like to trade off a little bit of portability for better performance, then <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ASUS VivoBook S 15</strong></span> is another excellent option for music production in the same price range.</p>
<p>It offers 8th generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of HDD and 256GB of SSD for storage. As far as graphics are concerned, it is handled by dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU on this laptop. The laptop also houses a more prominent 15-inch full HD IPS display which gives plenty of room to work on DAW and djing softwares. The laptop weighs 3.7 pounds so it is still a pretty lightweight machine to take anywhere in the backpack and its battery can also last up to 6 to 7 hours (depending on usage) to easily work on-the-go. However, its fans aren&#8217;t the quietest, but overall, it&#8217;s still a great option for students and beginners in music production.<span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> | <strong><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2IElIpI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Amazon</a></strong></span></p></blockquote>

<h3>7. Microsoft Surface Book 2</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2piKnY8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3074 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Microsoft-Surface-Book-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Book 2 - best 2-in-1 laptops for music production and djing" width="550" height="388"></a></p>
<p>Surface series of convertibles, laptops, and tablets from Microsoft have gained quick-popularity and have been one of the most productive and versatile devices ever since. Our current contender, the Surface Book 2 is one such device from the collection, which can not only prove out to be an excellent everyday work-machine, but can also be an ideal device for DJing and music production, thanks to its powerful specs and long battery life.</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface Book 2 comes in two different sizes, 13 and 15-inch, and you can choose from different processors, RAM and storage capacity as per your requirements and budget. However, we recommend its 15-inch variant for music production with quad-core Intel i7 Processor, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. The best thing about opting for a 15-inch Surface Book 2 is, all the 15-inch variants come with <strong>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB DDR5 VRAM</strong> which makes this laptop capable enough to play new games. However, the device isn&#8217;t meant for gaming. It is designed for productivity tasks such as photo-video editing, and making music and djing, and we think it serves the purpose quite well.</p>
<p>Being a 2-in-1 laptop with such a unique design, it still doesn&#8217;t miss out on any essential ports and slots which is yet another reason to make it our top pick for djing. That said, the Surface Book 2 houses a two full-size USB 3.0 ports, one USB Type-C port, a microSD card reader and a 3.5mm audio jack.</p>
<p>Overall, Microsoft Surface Book 2 is a more favorable device for DJs rather than the music producers who work from studios. It makes travelling and making music on-the-go so effortless, thanks to its versatile form-factor, and its powerful hardware and its ample amount of connectivity options make sure that you&#8217;re ready for DJing every time you hit the stage.</p>
