<h3 class="p2">MacBook Air Discounts<span class="s1"><b><br />
</b></span></h3>
<p>The 2019 MacBook Air although not leaps and bounds ahead in terms of features than the 2018 model is a great all-around ultrabook for anyone who needs a thin and light MacBook with all-day battery life. That said, it is the cheapest MacBook in the entire lineup of Apple laptops right now, and with the discounts it has become accessible to even budget buyers. With a dual-core 8th-Generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and integrated UHD 617 graphics its performance is good enough even for intensive workloads. If display is what makes you tick, then the 2019 MacBook Air comes now with a True Tone 13-inch Retina display, which is the only notable difference from the 2018 model.</p>
<p>If this model resonates with your needs and preferences, Best Buy is offering you a chance to own the brand new 2019 <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/KLW1A" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Air with 128GB SSD</a> storage for just $899.

That’s $200 less than its original price.</p>
<p>The 2018 MacBook Air models are also discounted right now on Amazon and Best Buy, but the 2019 model retails for almost the same price right now, so it’s better to get the new model.

<h3>MacBook Pro Deals</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best MacBook deals this month came from the MacBook Pro line of products. Here are the most notable ones:<br />
</span></p>
<h4>MacBook Pro 13&#8243; Deals</h4>
<p>The 2019 MacBook Pro was just a specs update and a few adjustments to its controversial butterfly keyboard switches. It’s available now with the newest quad-core 9th Gen Intel CPUs and Touch Bar and Touch ID still remains standard across all the MacBook Pro models which is a great addition that Apple made last year to the 13-inch MacBook Pro models, so more or less, it’s a great option for power users who are looking for the Mac that enables them to perform high performance tasks such as coding, photo-video editing, etc.</p>
<p>Though the new model is only a few months old, we’ve already spotted some irresistible deals on them.</p>
<p>The base 2019 MacBook Pro 13″ model with 1.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD is available for <a href="https://amzn.to/38TbnkE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,229 on Amazon</a>, saving you $80 which is not a very great deal.

That is $200 less than its list price which is an excellent deal!</p>
<p>For those who need more horsepower, but still don’t want to lose out on small size, the 2019 MacBook Pro with 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor offers adequate amount of power to get you through almost anything.
