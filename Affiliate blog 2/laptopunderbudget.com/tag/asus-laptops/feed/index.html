										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far as CES 2019 is concerned, ASUS has been at the top of their game. They have come up with the most accessible, yet innovative solutions to cater to almost every kind of audience. Not a few days ago, ASUS introduced <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-officially-unveils-four-new-chromebooks-ces-2019/">rugged and thick notebooks for students and kids</a> &#8211; able to withstand almost any sort drop and bump that you can imagine. Now, they are back with a more premium and exquisite version of their well-worshipped Flip C302, named the Chromebook Flip C434.</p>
<p>The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 boasts a beautiful edge-to-edge screen and the signature Flip 360 hinge as its main attractions. The chassis is an all-metal aluminum body weighing just about 3.3 pounds and is only 15.7 mm thick. The rough rubber might be durable but there is just something about a silver metal finish you can&#8217;t turn away from. Plus its a good camouflage for those nasty fingerprints as well. The 2-in-1 book&#8217;s 360 ErgoLift hinge transforms the device into a traditional laptop, tablet, and tent modes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5087" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C434-1.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook Flip C434" width="599" height="498" /></p>
<p>Now, the ASUS Flip C302 was a classic success among budget users no doubt, as it provided great value for money. The Flip C434 not only does maintain the same aspect but also comes with a bunch of new upgrades. For instance now there is support for Intel’s 8th Gen Y-Series (choice between an i7-8500Y, i5-8200Y, or M3-8100Y) CPUs and the addition of a USB-A port. Apart from the affordability, there are still a lot of similarities left between the older and the latest version. Like the 8GB of RAM, upto 128GB of storage, and the microSD card slot.</p>
<p>The reason ASUS is able to offer premium looks, mid-range price, portability, and a good processor is due to the lightweight ChromeOS. This lightweight operating system has been a long companion of budget users and comes in good looking books as well. Just like the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 which stands out with its Full HD NanoEdge 14-inch touchscreen display. And that too with maintaining the very &#8216;in&#8217; trend of slim bezels which are just 5mm on this one. What&#8217;s even more impressive is that they have still to fit in a front facing camera at the top.</p>
<p>ASUS also hasn&#8217;t lost the chiclet keyboard that provides one of the most comfortable typing experiences and is also backlit. And thanks to the flexible hinge, the experience just gets better.</p>

<p>ASUS has announced this all-purpose premium ultrabook to be out in a few months. For the price &#8211; ASUS points out that instead of going overboard with either fancy specs or huge savings, they have decided to level both and offer surpassing specs within a mid-range cost and is offering its notebook with a starting price of $569.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you call a Surface Pro that&#8217;s been fitted with enough firepower to effectively replace a desktop gaming rig? Apparently, you&#8217;d call it the ASUS ROG Mothership.</p>
<p>With the goal of &#8220;redefining the form factor for desktop replacement gaming laptops&#8221;, the ASUS ROG Mothership has done that, and more.</p>
<p>At CES 2019, ASUS turned a lot of heads when they announced the 17.3-inch 2-in-1 gaming laptop. Mirroring the design of the Surface Pro, complete with the pop-up kickstand and detachable folding keyboard, the ASUS ROG Mothership isn&#8217;t just any gaming laptop though. It&#8217;s what you&#8217;d refer to as a &#8220;Surface Pro on steroids&#8221;.</p>
<h3>A Gaming Laptop Quite Unlike Any Other</h3>
<p>While the ASUS ROG Mothership may share a similar design with the Surface Pro, the two have a lot of differences.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5039" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ROG-Mothership-from-Side-CES-2019.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Mothership from Side - CES 2019" width="750" height="522" /></p>
<p>For starters, the ROG Mothership is bigger. It comes with a 17.3-inch 1080p display with a 144HZ refresh rate and a 3ms response time, and perhaps more importantly, NVIDIA&#8217;s proprietary adaptive sync technology, G-Sync.</p>
<p>The screen, though, isn&#8217;t the only thing that makes the ASUS ROG Mothership the gaming equivalent of Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Pro. It&#8217;s also powered by the recently-announced mobile version of NVIDIA&#8217;s all new RTX 2080 graphics card, as well as Intel&#8217;s premiere Coffee-Lake processor, the i9-8950HK processor. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, ASUS also announced that they have overclocked both the CPU and the GPU beyond their stock settings. This is something that they could reportedly afford to do so because of how the vertical design gives the souped up 2-in-1 better cooling capabilities.</p>
<p>Storage-wise, the ASUS ROG Mothership comes equipped with three NVMe SSDs in RAID 0. It also comes with up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy features include facial recognition support for Windows Hello, and a wide assortment of available ports (1 x USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port, 1 x USB-C port, 4 x USB Type-A ports, 1 x HDMI port, 1 x SD card slot, 1 x Ethernet port), as well as dual-280W charging ports.</p>
<h3>Accessories and Weight</h3>
<p>For easy one-handed setup, ASUS worked hard to make sure that kickstand pops out automatically from the bottom of the computer. The keyboard isn&#8217;t half bad either. You can attach it to the ROG Mothership magnetically, or you can also use it as a wireless keyboard. To save space, you can even fold the entire keyboard in half. If you&#8217;re worried about latency issues, you can still connect the detached keyboard via the USB-C port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5038" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ROG-Mothership-Keyboard-Style-CES-2019.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Mothership Keyboard Style - CES 2019" width="920" height="500" /></p>
<p>For all of its greatness, the one glaring problem with the ASUS ROG Mothership is its weight.</p>
<p>Whereas the 5th-generation Surface Pro weighs just 1.73 pounds for the i7 model, ASUS estimates that the ROG Mothership will be around 10.36 pounds. Although it does indeed succeed in being a &#8220;desktop replacement gaming laptop&#8221;, it might just be a bit too heavy for gamers who are literally always on the go.</p>

<h3>Are There Other Things that ASUS Announced?</h3>
<p>While the ASUS ROG Mothership headlined ASUS&#8217; announcement at CES 2019, it wasn&#8217;t the only eye-catching product that the Taiwan-based gaming company had to offer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5040 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-17-GX701-with-Nvidia-RTX-GPU.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX701 with Nvidia RTX Max-Q GPU" width="650" height="455" /></p>
<p>Overshadowed by its bigger and more ambitious sibling are the stealthier and sleeker ASUS ROG Zephyrus S laptops, the all-new GX701 and an updated GX531. The former is essentially a bigger version of last year&#8217;s GX531 for gamers who need the additional real estate. The GX701 upgrades the screen from 15.6 inches to 17.3 inches. Despite making the display larger, ASUS claims that the GX701 remains the most compact 17-inch gaming laptop available on the market. At just 18.7mm thick, 15.7-inches wide, and roughly 6 pounds, it&#8217;s hard to deny that claim. It&#8217;s also much thinner and lighter compared to the ASUS ROG Mothership.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 17-inch Laptops &#8211; Buying Guide</a></strong></p>
<p>At the same time, ASUS will also upgrade the latest GX531 to have the same specs as the all-new GX701. The only difference is that the GX531 will retain the 15-inch display and will be slightly thinner than the GX701 at just 15mm.</p>
<p>Other than the size difference, both the all-new GX701 and updated GX531 will feature the same specs under the hood when they launch. This includes the latest Intel processors and NVIDIA&#8217;s Max-Q design RTX mobile GPUs, as well as the ability to charge over the USB-C port.</p>
<h3>Shipping Date and Pricing</h3>
<p>ASUS expects the ROG Zephyrus S GX701 and the GX531, as well as the ASUS ROG Mothership to hit the market sometime later in Q1 2019. However, ASUS have yet to release any info regarding the pricing and exact configurations of the gaming laptops.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS has taken their &#8216;new year resolutions&#8217; a bit too seriously and we are not complaining. The laptop giant has just announced their two slimmest ultrabooks at <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/ces-2019/">CES 19</a>, packing some hefty features. Their 2019 lineup includes two beautiful additions to their ZenBook line. The ZenBook S13 and ZenBook 14.</p>
<p>Both ultrabooks are expected to be out in a few months. While little information is available on their pricing, the thing we know for certain is that these notebooks are not a typical case of chunk reduction like most small laptops. ASUS has made sure that the small footprint of the devices does not affect their marks and traits.</p>
<h2>Asus ZenBook 14 UX431</h2>
<p>The beefier of the two &#8211; the ASUS Zenbook 14 UX431 is nonetheless classified as a decent machine. But the Zenbook 14 does take the cake in some aspects. Such as it comes with two additional bass boosters at the bottom, providing a comparatively better and immersive sound. Adding more to this list is an HDMI port and SD card slot along with a USB Type-C port, and a standard USB 2.0 and 3.1 port in the Zenbook 14.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5014" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ZenBook-14-UX431.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook 14 UX431 Launched at CES 2019" width="654" height="657" /></p>
<p>While it might not have the extraordinarily slim form factor of its sibling, what it does have is the latest Whiskey Lake Intel processor. Nicely complimenting this addition is the  Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics, up to 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM. One of the few reasons this model is classier by today&#8217;s standards is because of its build and chassis.</p>
<p>The ASUS Zenbook 14 packs all this amazing hardware into a slender, Utopia Blue color and the spun metal chassis. The shiny, slim device apart from looking phenomenal- weighs so light you&#8217;ll barely feel it. Weighing just under 3.2 pounds and has an 86 percent the screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s cool though is the touchpad on the Asus ZenBook 14 doubles as a numpad. It illuminates and makes up for the missing numpad on the keyboard which will be helpful while creating spreadsheets. Moreover, there is a small adjustment where when the notebook is flipped open, the lid slides a little to prop up the keyboard. This Ergolyft hinge creates a more comfortable setting for typing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers with Most Comfortable Keyboard</a></strong></p>
<p>The Asus ZenBook 14 is expected to be available sometime in early 2019 starting at $749. Which is a relief as the price tag keeps this device from being listed in the expensive range.</p>
<h2>Asus ZenBook S13 UX392</h2>
<p>Featuring a whopping 97% screen-to-body ratio. the ZenBook S13 is definitely the talk of the town. Smaller, more elegant and more premium than its sibling, this one is ASUS&#8217; new shiny trophy. This laptop has condensed the bezel size to just 2.5mm with an FHD frameless four-sided NanoEdge display. The S13 stands for everything the ZenBook line is known for. Power, with a mix of style and portability. What&#8217;s the most impressive part is that the ZenBook S13 was able to meet the demanding MIL-STD 810G military standards of durability. Which says a lot about ASUS&#8217; vision with this machine. That is to create a delicate looking all-purpose PC with the ability to withstand harshest environments.</p>
<p>All I will say is that do not get deceived by the ultra-portability of the ZenBook S13 as its roomy enough to hold an NVIDIA GeForce MX150 discrete graphics card, 1TB of PCIe x4 SSD storage, and the latest 8th Gen Intel Core Whiskey Lake quad-core processor. Asus claims that even with a comparatively smaller chassis than the ZenBook 14, its 50Wh battery will provide up to 15 hours of life. It also sports all the good bits of its sibling as well which is the illuminating touchpad cum numpad and the shiny blue chassis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5015" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-ZenBook-S13-UX392.jpg" alt="ASUS ZenBook S13 UX392" width="720" height="512" /></p>
<p>I know what you might be thinking. The narrow bezels usually mean a poorly placed camera as there isn&#8217;t much you can cram on such a tiny bezel. Well, ASUS has found their way around that dilemma too. Thanks to the additional micro bezel or a notch (call it what you like) at the top of the screen, the camera placement has not been compromised one bit. Besides that, the notch actually helps to open the lid of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus ZenBook S13 is expected to be available around the same time as the ZenBook 14. No information about its pricing is shared by ASUS as of yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years after their successful foray into the Chromebook market with the Skylake-powered C302, ASUS has officially released a direct follow up to the popular Chromebook at CES 2019. Additionally, the Taiwan-based tech giant also released three more Chrome OS devices, for a total of four new releases. Each one is designed to cater to a specific range of students. In total, the entire line aims to cover every kind of student, from toddlers to teenage adolescents.</p>
<h3>Introducing ASUS&#8217; Latest Line of Chromebooks</h3>
<p>The Chromebook C204, Chromebook Flip C214, Chromebook C403 and Chromebook Tablet CT100 all feature near-identical specifications across the board and follow a similar design philosophy. However, there are a few differences in each one. For starters, the Chromebook C204 is ASUS&#8217; follow up to their popular Chromebook C202, which they released roughly two years ago for kids in primary school. Meanwhile, the Chromebook Flip C214 will serve as the successor to last year&#8217;s C213, a 2-in-1 convertible that comes with stylus support, as well as a 360° hinge and a touchscreen display, allowing for use as a traditional laptop and as a tablet at the same time.</p>
<p>As for the other two, The Chromebook C403 and the Chromebook Tablet CT100 are both totally new. The former is essentially a bigger version of the C204. Housed inside a larger chassis with <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a> but with similar, albeit slightly but older specs. The C403 is the perfect laptop for students in middle school and high school who mostly prefer the larger real estate for homework and personal use. The latter is ASUS&#8217; first Chrome OS tablet. It comes with a 9.7&#8243; display and stylus support to draw and take notes. The CT100 <a title="The Best Tablets For Kids – Our Most Recommended Kids Tablets That Come With Comprehensive Parental Controls" href="https://tabletunderbudget.com/best-tablets-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tablet is designed specifically for kids</a> who are just starting out to learn and understand computers, but comes with the same Chrome OS found in the chromebooks.</p>
<h3>Military-grade Build Quality</h3>
<p>ASUS prides themselves on their use of military-grade &#8220;ruggedized&#8221; designs for all four of their latest Chrome OS devices, using reinforced and rubberized edges to help protect the devices from the occasional bumps and falls. Also, each Chromebook come equipped with water-resistant and tamper-resistant keyboards for added durability. Although the CT100 tablet doesn&#8217;t have a keyboard, it features the same &#8220;ruggedized&#8221; design that makes it both accessible and durable enough to withstand everyday use by a toddler.</p>
<h3>Display, Size, and Weight</h3>
<p>Although all of the Chromebook devices follow the same design philosophy, each one comes in a different display size, total size, and of course, weight.</p>
<p>The largest of the four is the C403. It comes with a 14-inch HD LED display with anti-glare coating, measuring at 13.5&#8243; x 9.2&#8243; x 0.8&#8243; and weighing at 3.7 pounds. It&#8217;s considerably larger than the smaller C204, which only weighs 2.6 pounds, measuring at 11.5&#8243; x 7.8&#8243; x 0.8&#8243; and is equipped with a smaller 11.6-inch LED display with anti-glare coating. However, both models come with a 180° hinge that makes it easier for users to show their work to other people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 11-inch Laptops</a></strong></p>
<p>As for the Chromebook Flip C214, it comes with an 11.6-inch HD touch display. It can serve as either as a tablet or as a laptop, depending on its user&#8217;s needs, thanks to its durable 360° hinge. It clocks in at 2.6 pounds, which is the same weight as the C204.</p>
<p>Finally, the CT100 is a 9.7-inch tablet that weighs only 1.3 pounds and is designed specifically for kids.</p>
<h3>Specs and Battery Life</h3>
<p>Both the 2-in-1 Chromebook Flip C214 and the smaller Chromebook C204 are powered by the latest Intel Gemini Lake processors. Meanwhile, the larger C403 comes equipped with a slightly older Apollo Lake processor. All three can support up to 8GB of LDDR4 memory and up to 32GB of eMMc storage. However, only the C214 can support up to 64GB eMMc storage. The port selection on both the C204 and the C403 include 2 x USB Type-C 3.1 ports, 2 x USB Type-A 3.0 ports, a MicroSD card reader, an audio combo jack, as well as Bluetooth 4.2 support. The C214 comes with roughly the same port selection, but only just 1 x USB Type-A 3.0 port.</p>
<p>As for the battery, ASUS has equipped their latest line of products with 45 WHr batteries, although the C204 comes with a little bit more juice at 50WHr.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>ASUS have yet to announce pricing for all regions for their latest line of Chrome OS devices. However, according to ASUS, retailers should have the devices in stock sometime later this year, with the C403 and the C214 possibly already available in Spring.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>

A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">ASUS has been one of the global best sellers in laptops division and has been launching various segment of laptops to satisfy various niches. ASUS has recently announced their new gaming series of laptops under TUF (The Ultimate Force), which is derived from the company’s motherboard naming. Considering the major shift of users towards the budget segment laptops, the company has launched the TUF series of gaming laptops, which are mid-rangers, unlike the high-end ROG series of gaming laptops.</p>
<p>TUF motherboards from ASUS are known for their reliability, and stability under extreme conditions. And, same has been brought down in building these new mid-range TUF gaming laptops by the taiwanese giant. On top of this, all these laptops are now powered by the all-new, 8th-generation Intel Core processors.</p>
<p>ASUS has been claiming that the latest TUF series of gaming laptops were designed to last longer than most of the already-available average laptops.</p>
<p>So, after hearing so much about these series of laptops, we decided to put the ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop to the test in our lab, to make our readers familiar with the real-time usage of this mid-range gaming laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX504 comes with an all-plastic body with a red hue to the finishing. The laptop looks stylish and lushes out the gaming pattern from every angle. It comes with the right placement of keyboard, trackpad, ports, and slots, making it one of the most ergonomic laptops in the segment.</p>
<p>Speaking about the dimensions of the device, it measures 15.12 x 10.31 x 0.98 inches in length, breadth, and thickness. The laptop weighs <strong>just over 5 pounds</strong>, making it easy to carry around. Without speaking much about the regular aspects of the device, let’s drill down to what are the special features in the design of this laptop.</p>
<div id="attachment_3776" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3776" class="wp-image-3776 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-Review-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop Review - Design" width="550" height="555" /><p id="caption-attachment-3776" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Metallic Premium Steel Finish on Lid with a Glowing Red ASUS Logo</strong></em></p></div>
<p>ASUS has worked hard and equipped the TUF FX504 with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">advanced anti-dust cooling system</span>. This system is meant to expel the dust particles out of the innards of the laptops through the two available dedicated tunnels, ensuring zero dust residues inside the laptop. Being a gaming laptop, the FX504 has to manage the heating issues and to deal with this, ASUS has integrated the HyperCool technology in the laptop for thermal maintenance. During our test, we couldn&#8217;t tell about the dust as internals were already neat and tidy, but laptop remained cool and calm during our heavy to hardcore usage including gaming.</p>
<p>All in all, the laptop looks absolutely charm and considering the price point, its build quality is also top-notch. Of-course, it isn&#8217;t like a laptop built completely from a single piece of metal, but materials used by ASUS to built their new TUF series of gaming laptops are tough and will ensure the longer life span, no matter in what conditions you use this laptop.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 laptop comes with three different display options with varied refresh rates. Our current contender, the FX504 sports a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Our review unit had a low quality 60Hz TN Panel with 45% in NTSC color gamut. As you would expect, the viewing angles are pathetic and color-reproduction is also very dull. However, it is decent enough for gaming once you set it in the right position and we also liked the matte finishing on the display.</p>
<p>Well, if you want a better display, then Asus does offer TUF FX504 laptop with a full HD 120Hz IPS panel (94% in NTSC color range) but that costs extra and adds up a lot to its original price.</p>
<p>So overall, we think that the display on the laptop could have been a bit better in terms of brightness and viewing angles to suffice the gaming enthusiasts needs.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the internals of the ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop, it is powered by the latest 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. This latest processor can be turbo boosted up to a massive 3.9GHz under full throttle, making it one of the fastest laptops in its segment.</p>
<p>On graphics front, our unit had a less powerful 2GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU but TUF FX504 laptop is also available with GTX 1050 Ti (More on the gaming performance later). Storage on the device is handled by a 1TB of FireCuda storage, bagging the laptop yet another advantage over the other laptops with a normal HDD.  The solid-state hybrid disk (SSHD) on this laptop offers speed, which is twice as fast as a normal hard disk. This helps in faster data transfer speeds, and also helps in loading the applications quickly. The hard drive also ensures less power consumption while maintaining performance and durability.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the laptop is concerned, the laptop has two RAM slots which can accept the RAM up to 32GB and there&#8217;s also a PCIE Gen 3 slot inside for SSD.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800 of 2018</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 comes with a very sturdy keyboard, which the company claims to take up to 20 million key presses. Each key on the keyboard delivers a 1.8mm travel distance, to give a better and more efficient tactile feedback.</p>
<div id="attachment_3779" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-image-3779 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Review.jpg" alt="Keyboard with 1.8mm key travel and spaced function keys" width="643" height="424" /><p id="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>1.8mm traveling curved keys</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop has been designed with gaming in mind while not compromising on the looks and design. Accordingly, the keyboard on the device also gives the laptop the right gaming hue to satisfy almost all the users. The keyboard is backlit enabled and is curved to the right extent to give a better usage for working in dark.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers with Most Comfortable Keyboard</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Considering the fact that this laptop is a primarily gaming-stationed one, you get a decent list of specifications, which will suffice the gaming needs. The device comes with two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and an HDMI 1.4 port. The device also comes with a microSD card reader.</p>
<div id="attachment_3778" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3778" class="wp-image-3778 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-from-Side.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop from Side" width="531" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-3778" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>No ports on right hand side to keep your gaming mouse</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Moreover, all these ports are aligned on the left hand side of the notebook, keeping the right side fully-free for the mouse. That earns ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop 10 out of 10 for the ergonomics.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 runs on the Windows 10 operating system out of the box. Windows 10 is the most efficient and productive operating system to date and is highly optimized to house and run most of the modern games and apps.</p>
<p>Thanks to the windows store, users can get almost all sort of applications such as productive, utilities, entertainment, gaming, and more with ease. The device also comes with some handy features such as multi-window, small-window support to show important notifications and instructions, without interrupting the gaming experience. Considering all these aforementioned features, Windows 10 is an ideal operating system for all the hardcore gamers.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 is one of the few laptops available in the market right now to come with the latest 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H quad-core processor right now. Accordingly, the laptop did surprise us with its impeccable speeds and resource handling abilities. Thanks to its 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop&#8217;s multitasking is quite well, and during our usage, we never actually had to shed a sweat using it. That said, the laptop is undeniably an able device for almost all the everyday essentials such as browsing, watching videos, playing audio files, working on documents and more.</p>

<p>Speaking about the connectivity of the device, it comes with super fast Wave 2 WiFi for high speed reliable wireless connectivity. Moreover, the 2&#215;2 MIMO configuration provides up to 30% wider coverage area than the basic 1&#215;1 configuration for uninterrupted gaming even at the less WiFi reception areas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3780" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Performance" width="550" height="564" /></p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming on the device, the higher clock speed of the processor and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU runs the show. The laptop does exceptionally well in handling almost all of the moderate games. High-end games can also be played on the device, with some restrictions considering this is a mid-range gaming device which has less powerful GPU with just 2GB of DDR5 VRAM.</p>
<p>One thing that we note during our test is the laptop doesn’t heat up even after heavy gaming, thanks to its dual fans with advanced hyper cooling technology. All in all, we had a good time with this laptop in terms of everyday performance as well as gaming.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>As I’ve been saying, the laptop also does pretty well in terms of serving as a multimedia powerhouse. It comes with an immersive 7.1-channel surround sound along with DTS headphone slot. When using the laptop with a headset on, we actually felt the theatre like sound, which helped a lot while playing First-person Shooter games on the laptop. In addition to the powerful speakers, it also comes with a powerful built-in equalizer, which allows adjusting the sound as per the user’s requirements.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; Djing of 2018</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>We also played almost all video formats on the device, and we didn’t have any issue worth mentioning. The built-in microphone on the ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop is also worth applauding. We tested it by recording the audio and to our surprise it sounded crystal clear. We also tried using its built-in microphone for commanding the Cortana (Windows assistant) in a room with a lot of noise, and in such conditions as well, it filtered out all the ambient noise and picked up clear voice quite efficaciously.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a lithium-ion battery, which takes about <strong>2.5 hours to fully charge</strong> from 0 to 100. During our review, we were actually surprised to see the battery backup of the device considering the fact that it’s a gaming stationed laptop. Even after heavy usage and multitasking, we still managed to get about 6 hours of continuous usage on a single charge, which is pretty good for a gaming laptop of this calibre.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3782" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Thin-and-Light-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Thin and Light Gaming Laptop Review" width="550" height="569" /></p>
<p>With all our experience with the different laptop models, we can definitely assert that no device is perfect. Every laptop has to undergo a couple trade-offs if not more to meet the requirements. Accordingly, the ASUS TUF FX504 is a very reliable and powerful laptop with decent specifications. However, there are couple of misses, which we could evidently notice. The first being the display, which is a very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">low-quality TN panel</span> and second is its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less powerful Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU</span> which provides just 2GB of dedicated video memory.</p>
<p>But if we exclude these things, then ASUS is offering a very good package overall with the trust seal of TUF. You get all the latest set of hardware specifications and highly intuitive anti-dust cooling system which not only improves the performance but also enhances the life-span of the laptop.</p>
<p>So, if you want a &#8220;tough&#8221; gaming laptop that can run most AAA titles at medium graphics settings then the ASUS TUF FX504 is the gaming laptop you will love it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA has been launched against the likes of Dell’ XPS and Lenovo’ Yoga series of laptops. VivoBook is a sleek and stylish laptop, which is powered with ample configuration to give a tough fight to its rivals in the segment. However, the unique selling point of this laptop is its price. The laptop is priced just under $500, which makes it stand out from its competitors.</p>
<p>First looking at the specifications, we were actually a bit amazed to see VivoBook offer so much for so less amount. Therefore, without any further delay, we quickly brought the laptop and put it to the test so that we can aid our readers and make them know about this premium looking budget-friendly laptop.</p>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is being publicised as a premium yet affordable all-rounder. And here is our take on this laptop:</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA is a revamped version of the previous VivoBook edition of laptops launched by the company. This time ASUS has been in trend and made its laptops much more elegant, sleek, and stylish. The laptops are also lighter and are marginally thinner than its predecessors and weigh just about 3.7 pounds and come with measurements of 14.2 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches.</p>
<div id="attachment_3097" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-image-3097 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop - Design" width="650" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thinner &amp; Lighter (Just 0.8-inch thick and weighs 3.7 pounds)</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a brushed metal, shiny chassis, in a glittering grey color. The laptop is thicker at the hinge-edge and gradually gets narrower. The design aspects of the VivoBook, we feel, are largely drawn from the likes of the <a title="Check Current Price of MacBook Air on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2hKvugK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple’s MacBook Air</a> externally. The placement of ports, trackpad, keyboard, and other vitals are very similar to the previous generation of VivoBooks, and all in all, the laptop feels quite easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3098 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop Review" width="650" height="386" /></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of this laptop is that it comes with an ultra-narrow 0.3-inch ASUS’ proprietary NanoEdge bezel, which gives an amazing 80% of screen-to-body ratio. The bezels on the laptop are fairly negligible and are probably one of the rarest laptops in the market currently to offer such slim bezel display in a laptop at such low price.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, ASUS VivoBook F510UA makes it feels like you have a full-size 15.6” FHD WideView display embedded into a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a>, which not only makes it compact and sleek to use, but also offers wider, bigger, and much better display. On a final note on the design and build quality, the laptop comes with a uniform solid build quality and certainly is beautiful enough to attract the masses.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LED display which is vibrant. As far as the resolution of the display is concerned, it comes with a Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. As mentioned earlier, the laptop’s WideView makes it look even better, and thanks to its larger display, the viewing angles on this machine are perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_3099" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-image-3099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop - Display Review" width="800" height="445" /><p id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also comes with the ASUS’ proprietary Splendid visual optimization technology, which automatically provides the optimized visuals to the user for almost any kind of content being played. The laptop comes with custom features as well as pre-installed display modes such as Normal, Vivid, Eye-Care, and Manual, which can be accessed and enabled based on the user’s choice. The videos on the screen also turn out to be a visual treat all thanks to the ASUS Tru2Life Video technology which enhances the movie watching experience on this laptop. The display on this device comes with an intelligent set of sensors which optimises the essential visual parameters such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and hue in every pixel to produce vivid and lively imagery.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA laptop offers a robust set of innards and is undeniably a powerful device on the paper. Let’s have a quick glance at what does the laptop offers. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the latest and the most advanced, 8th Generation of Intel Core i5-8250U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 1.6GHz which can, however, rattle up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Laptops with Intel Core i5 8th Gen Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Multitasking and the applications on the device are handled by an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage department on the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of HDD, which is although ample amount of storage, still lags behind SSD when it comes to data transfer speeds and efficiency. We hoped that the laptop comes with an SSD storage, this could have been a deadly combination for a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $500</a>. The laptop comes with an integrated graphics coprocessor and doesn’t come with any additional GPU.</p>
<p>VivoBook also comes with a fingerprint sensor to add a layer of security to the device and the data in it. This is certainly one of the rare finds in a laptop priced at this range.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the hardware is concerned, the laptop&#8217;s RAM can be upgraded up to 16GB, and its hard drive is also swappable with solid state drive. So, overall ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is a future-proof device which not only provides all current generation hardware specifications but also ensures that it stays up to date with time.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The VivoBook comes with a VGA front-facing camera, and like most of the other laptops in the segment, the front camera on the device is just serviceable. It can capture decent images in daylight conditions and fails to add details under low-light. The image rendering of the device’s camera is quick and is able enough to capture fleeting moments during a video call. There’s nothing exceptional about the webcam on this laptop, and at the same time, do note that there’s nothing to complain as well.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the ports and connectivity options on the VivoBook, it comes with a standard set of ports, which is more or less a common practice in most of the laptops. All the ports are uniformly distributed along the two sides of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Ports and Slots" width="800" height="370" /></p>
<p>The device comes with one USB 3.1 and one USB 3.0 port, for faster, reliable, and efficient data transfers. And, comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports for adding up additional peripherals. It also houses an HDMI, 3.5mm Audio Jack, and an SD card reader.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop comes with Windows 10 Home variant pre-installed. Windows 10, which is world&#8217;s most used computer operating system, needs no introduction of what it’s capable of. The laptop doesn’t come with any much of the bloatware and is, therefore, fast, efficient, and nag-free. The device, however, does come pre-installed with some of the productive aspects and tools, which ought to increase the overall productivity of the system.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to its powerful and most importantly, the latest set of hardware and innards, the VivoBook offers excellent performance for the budget. No matter how strong the specifications are on paper, what actually matters is its real-time usage and performance. And during our usage and hands-on with this sleek and stylish looking laptop, we were satisfied with its overall performance.</p>
<p>The laptop stays quiet and offers decent graphic-based tasks performance. That said, as the laptop doesn’t come with a specific dedicated graphics coprocessor, the gaming on the device might not cater hardcore gamers. However, thankfully, it can handle small to mediocre demanding games quite well, thanks to the Intel&#8217;s integrated UHD 620 graphics.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Multimedia stands as a common stop for all sorts of laptop users. Be it gamers, businessmen, students, regular home purpose, no matter what the need is, a laptop will undeniably be used as a source of multimedia.</p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA comes with Two Built-in Stereo Speakers which provides very powerful and thumping audio output. During our review, we tested the speakers with bass heavy, punchy tracks, accustomed mids, and also treble stationed lean tracks. And to our surprise, the sound was pretty clear on all the occasions.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, it can handle almost all forms of videos and codecs. 4K and Full HD videos were playing absolutely lag-free and thanks to its wide viewing angles, we actually had a good time watching content on this laptop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Battery Life</span></p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA was one among the very first laptop we tested, which came along with the 8th Gen Intel core processors and we must say, the chipsets are very power efficient and robust. The laptop offers decent battery backup and is probably way ahead of most of its rivals in the segment.</p>
<p>On a single charge, the laptop stays juiced up for about 5-6 hours of continuous usage. It takes just over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. The battery type on this laptop is a Li-Ion one, and our final comments on the battery life would be <em>&#8216;The laptop did not fail us in terms of battery life,&#8217;</em> while most others in this price range don&#8217;t provide this good specs and battery life for the price!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2960 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Not every laptop in the market comes with the latest 8th Gen Intel core processors and decent battery life. Even if they do, they will certainly not look as polished and solid as the ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop. Moreover, the price point of $500 makes this laptop an unarguably one of the better offerings you can get currently in the market. Provided, you are not looking for a gaming-stationed laptop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS has been a brand, which is constantly delivering value for money laptops in the recent past.

This laptop from ASUS offers some great specifications for a cut throat pricing. As a result, this laptop is one among the best sellers globally.</p>
<p>Considering the never declining demand for the day-to-day performer in laptops, we have decided to put the laptop to test, and here is what we feel of this machine. The laptop is although a business focusing device, we found out something very interesting about it during our review. Want to know what? Let’s get started.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 comes with a matte finish all plastic body, which gives the old school look of a common laptop. On the very first view, there was nothing groundbreaking about the laptop, as far its design and looks are concerned. The laptop although looks a little thick and hefty, it is actually, a very ergonomically built work machine. The laptop comes with the right placement of ports and connectivity slots, and all in all feels way better than its other competitors in the market.</p>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15 x 10.1 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weighs close to 5.2 pounds, which we felt was a little heavy for a laptop this calibre. However, it wasn&#8217;t that heavy to be considered as a drawback.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2685" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-Series-P2540UA-AB51-Business-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="650" height="627"></p>
<p>Space on both the edges of the laptop are well managed and are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The keyboard and the trackpad placement on the device are ideal for most cases and feels of superior quality.</p>

<p>All in all, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop comes with a balanced and finely engineered design and feels sturdy to grip and carry around.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>

<p>Thanks to its very bright and anti-reflective display, the laptop as expected scored a very good, 148 percent in RGB color ratio with the brightness measured around 210 nits, which is again way beyond the other laptops at this price range. The screen had detailed detailing and was able to show blacks and whites with accuracy.</p>

Speaking about the innards of this laptop, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is powered by a latest <strong>seventh gen Intel Core i5 processor</strong> paired with a good 8GB of RAM.&nbsp;The dual-core i5 processor is clocked at 2.5GHz, which can go up to 3.1GHz in its full throttle.

<p>Whereas, graphics on the laptop are handled well by the integrated Intel HD 620 graphics.

<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2694" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P2540UA-AB51-15.6-Inch-Business-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS P2540UA-AB51 Laptop - Ports &amp; Slots" width="900" height="377"></p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>ASUS P2540UA-AB51 has a 720p camera, which adequately does the work of capturing images and video calls. The laptop’s webcam provides a grainy output when snapping images, but on an overall note, the webcam on this laptop is quite serviceable.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ASUS P-Series P2540-AB51 laptop comes with Windows 10 Home (64 bit) operating system pre-installed. This is probably the best part of this laptop; The operating system. Windows 10 Home variant has been customised by various laptop vendors and has been baking with unnecessary bloatware. However, on ASUS P2540UA-AB51, the OS doesn&#8217;t have any bloatware and is absolutely the pure Windows OS.</p>
<p>Sounds unbelievable, Right? Well, we also thought the same until we tested this laptop and found that it has not a single app or software pre-installed when it booted for first time.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Considering the price tag, the laptop offers top-notch performance. Thanks to its latest set of specifications and hardware packed beneath the hood the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 delivers a very efficient and stable performance even under prolonged sessions of continuous usage. Since the laptop is powered by the latest seventh generation of Intel Core i5 processor, it doesn&#8217;t heat up even after a rugged usage. The laptop stays cool and stays calm, delivering the optimum performance expected.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2695" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-series-P2540UA-Business-Laptop-Overall-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS P-series P2540UA Business Laptop - Overall Performance Review" width="650" height="626"></p>
<p>We used the laptop rigorously to run our benchmarking apps and also streamed Full HD and 4K content for hours together. We also had a continuous browsing session with around 8-10 tabs alive concurrently in Chrome. Surprisingly, the laptop managed to multitask with ease, without any hassle. Thus, delivering an uninterrupted performance.</p>
<p>Speaking about the connectivity, we faced no issues to latch onto WiFi networks and the laptop provided good and constant connectivity without any bandwidth merging related issues. All that said, the laptop is an excellent multi-tasking device and can deliver a very reliable performance for all type of usages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="fasc-button fasc-size-xlarge fasc-type-flat ico-fa fasc-ico-before fa-tags" style="background-color: #e33333; color: #ffffff;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://amzn.to/2tx8oJY">$499.00 | Buy Now From Amazon</a></p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As the laptop is bolstered by an integrated Intel HD graphics, the gaming on this laptop is strictly mediocre. With its Intel HD 620 Graphics, the laptop delivers just average graphics rendering. Thankfully, the laptop can still run games, provided they aren&#8217;t graphic heavy. This laptop is not meant for gaming, and therefore, gaming is your primary requirement then this laptop is not for you. However, you can still play low-to-medium graphics enabled games on this laptop with ease.</p>
<p>The titles we ran on this laptop and managed to run smoothly after scaling down the graphics are &#8211; Minecraft (45 fps), Counter Strike &#8211; Global Offensive (40 fps).</p>
<p><em><strong>Check Out &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 7 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500 of 2017</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is although a business entered all-purpose laptop, it still has the potential to satisfy multimedia stationed users. That said, the laptop can play 4K content with ease and thanks to its bright antiglare display, watching content on this laptop is a delight.</p>
<p>But wait! there’s a catch, the laptop although have a good set of specifications, its speakers aren&#8217;t the best and they tend to get muffled up at higher volumes. The volume levels are also strictly mediocre. Therefore, we’d suggest the users to either go with an additional set of the audio system to aid the laptop.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Here comes the most essential and crucial zone of the laptop, the battery backup. Finding laptops with long-lasting batteries is no less than a herculean task these days. We cannot simply trust the numbers written by laptop manufacturers which are although intended to create the hype.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our current contender, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51, does exceptionally well in this segment.</p>
<p>The laptop provided up slightly over 8 hours of battery backup on a single charge with normal use, which is rather phenomenal in a laptop that is priced below $500! Again that depends upon one&#8217;s usages. While gaming we noticed that the battery backup was dropped to mere 3 hours and we had to plugin the charger which took about 3 hours to completely charge its lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note &#8211; The charging time can be reduced by keeping the laptop in the sleep mode or by shutting down the Windows.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2696" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P2540UA-AB51-15.6-Inch-Laptop-Battery-Life.jpg" alt="ASUS P2540UA-AB51 15.6 Inch Laptop - Battery Life" width="650" height="653"></p>
<p>The best thing about this laptop is, it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a removable battery</span> which makes it easy for users to replace the battery pack. So, if you&#8217;re a power user then you can buy another battery of the laptop and the full day battery backup will be just one battery swap away for you.</p>
<p>Considering the specifications the laptop offers and its performance, over 8 hours of battery life, is something which you don&#8217;t often find these days. So, if you are finding a long lasting laptop with performance, enough to meet your everyday tasks, then the <a href="http://amzn.to/2tx8oJY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop</a> is the right choice for you.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2687" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/asus-p-series-p2540ua-ab51-business-laptop-1.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop Review" width="500" height="352"></p>
<p>ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop is worth the every penny you&#8217;re going to spend on it. The laptop comes with a decent ergonomics, a long list of connectivity options, powerful innards, and a very bright and responsive display. Wait, there’s more, the laptop also comes with a fingerprint sensor for added security and comes with pure Windows OS.</p>

<h3 class="p1">Design</h3>
<p>Few contemporaries might give Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop a tough time when it comes to specifications but in the context of design, it is going to emerge as a winner. The modern day design adds up to the image of new generation laptop; the sleek, stylish and fitting in design makes this laptop the best product for everyone looking forward to do their work in style.</p>
<div id="attachment_2400" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-image-2400 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-15.6-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 15.6- Laptop Design" width="550" height="386" /><p id="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Icicle Gold Metallic Frame</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The fact that Asus F5556UA is a lightweight laptop, makes it easier for people to chose this particular machine over the others because there are very less laptops in this segment weighing near to 5 lbs. The Asus F556UA weighs 5.1lbs and it is one of the sleekest 15 inch laptop available in the market right now. So all you tech fanatics, who wanted to have something slim in your bag packs, here is the love of your dreams.</p>
<p>Although, Asus F556UA is a slim and sleek laptop, it doesn&#8217;t compromise in offering any of the required ports &amp; slots. For more info on what ports and slots does it offer, continue reading.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The stylish Asus F556UA has a screen quality that will put critics to shame, the quality output and controlled emission of blue-light makes movies more fun and safer. The 15.6-inch Full HD LED-Lit display has a matte coating, which minimizes screen glare and protect eyes against fatigue.</p>
<div id="attachment_2401" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-image-2401 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blue-light-filter-on-Asus-F556UA-AB54-NB-15-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Blue light filter on Asus F556UA-AB54 NB 15 inch Laptop" width="611" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54&#8217;s <em>Eye Care Mode to reduce blue light</em></strong></p></div>
<p>The display panel is way slimmer and stylish when compared to other contemporaries. People who are looking forward to have an affordable laptop with some stylish features can definitely go ahead with this laptop. Even prolonged laptop users like <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops For Programming – A One Stop Shop Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers</a> are going to love the unique combination of Full HD screen view with eye-protection features.</p>
<p>Color accuracy and brightness levels of display are also up to the par, making it <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right choice for photo editing pros</a>. Overall display quality of Asus F556UA is really good and there’s hardly any laptop in this segment that can give it a tough competition. I would give five out of five stars to this laptop when it comes to serving people with quality entertainment.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>When it comes to laptop, people think of HDD and RAM as the only legitimate specifications but there’s a lot more to consider like clock speed, processor count and also processor brand. Yes! clock speed and processor count are directly proportional to the speed at which a laptop processes data. That said, the Asus F556UA-AB54 sports a powerful dual core 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U processor which is from the latest 7th Generation family of processors from Intel.</p>
<div id="attachment_2402" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-image-2402 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-Laptop-Hardware-Specifications.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 Laptop Hardware Specifications" width="550" height="411" /><p id="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>256GB SSD | 7th Generation Intel Core i5 Processor | Windows 10 64-bit &#8211; still<em> so slim!</em></strong></p></div>
<p>While Asus F556UA may appear as the thought leader in processor segment but it is bit disappointing with disk space, the laptop comes with a 256GB of SSD, which is neither enough nor in competition with the other contemporaries. Laptops in this segment generally have 1TB of HDD, whereas 500GB of HDD is considered to be the basic. Asus must work on it and release a newer version with doubled disk-space sooner.</p>
<p>Let alone the processor and disk-space, the RAM is designed to empower the already impressive processor speed. The 8GB of RAM will be able to queue up more processes and allow the processor to process them without making the laptop freeze. The smart combination of Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM is going to do wonders for workaholics and entertainment freaks.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Asus is generally not known for camera quality but with the newly designed display in place, this F556UA produces pretty impressive images. One can easily depend upon this webcam for <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating tutorial videos for youtube</a> and help the tech naysayers out there. Long story short, the webcam on Asus F556UA-AB54 is not the best you can get in segment but it is pretty good for business meetings on Skype.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Unlike the modern day laptops, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is slim and still houses all kind of ports, there’s a USB 2.0, 3.0, Type-C, an HDMI, a DVD+RW, a card reader slot and also 3.5 mm jack for quality audio video output.</p>
<p>So, you get all the ports and slots that you were familiar with on your previous computer and also the newest and fastest USB Type-C port, which is expected to do the wonders with future of computing.</p>
<div id="attachment_2403" style="width: 1015px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-image-2403 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ports-and-Slots-on-Asus-F556UA-15-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots on Asus F556UA 15 Inch Laptop" width="1005" height="265" /><p id="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Asus F556UA being a laptop with slim &amp; sleek profile provides best in class connectivity.</strong></em></p></div>
<p>I think other laptop manufacturers should learn something from Asus about making slim laptops without compromising on REQUIRED ports and slots!</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA comes pre-installed with Windows 10 64-bit operating system. It is a premium Windows laptop, which ensures free upgrade to all further Windows 10 updates. With that said, the Asus F556UA does come with a few free preloaded software packages which are &#8220;actually useful&#8221;. Asus F556UA comes with one-year warranty but the customer service of the enterprise is not that great! <a title="Laptop Tech Support Showdown! Our 2017 Ratings" href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/tech-support-showdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer and Dell emerges as a better leader</a> when it comes to providing customers with quality support and after sales support. On top of all these features, the Windows 10&#8217;s proprietary voice-assistance Cortana, is a big added advantage for the potential laptop users, and now it supports multiple languages and regions, making it geographically distinct in terms of support.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Packed with Intel core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, the laptop is designed to cater people with exceptional performance. From students, to employees to artists, this laptop is perfect for anyone with normal to mediocre level of requirements.</p>
<p>The dual core Kaby Lake i5-7200U processor has the base clock frequency of 2.5GHz and turbo boost frequency up to 3.10GHz. The processor has got all the caliber required to run and accommodate almost all the apps very smoothly without much lag. The laptop during our review, did respond well to the inputs and all the hardcore apps we threw at it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2405" style="width: 903px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-image-2405 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Performance-review-of-Asus-F556UA-laptop.jpg" alt="Performance review of Asus F556UA laptop" width="893" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS IceCool Technology keeps laptop always COOL and STABLE</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also responds very efficiently when a series of programs are launched simultaneously. One can definitely multi-task on this laptop without witnessing an iota of heat being produced. It also has the smart Asus ice-cool technology which controls inside temperature of the laptop and makes sure that the laptop always stay at comfortable temperature.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop is going to rank par above the contemporaries because the Full HD LED-lit 15 inch screen and the pitch perfect audio makes it easier for the artists to note the nitty gritty of each and every songs. The output through 3.5mm jack is an immaculate example of quality. One can finally posses a laptop that produces exceptional stereo output and is in the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">range of $500</a>. The laptop comes with the ASUS’s proprietary <strong>SonicMaster audio technology</strong> meant to fine-tune the audio output. It was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. It supports a long list of professional codecs to ensures precise sound performance. In addition to all these, it has an optimised amplifier to deliver louder volumes and deeper bass.</p>
<div id="attachment_2406" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-image-2406 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SonicMaster-Powered-Immersive-Audio-and-Video-Experience.jpg" alt="SonicMaster Powered Immersive Audio and Video Experience" width="550" height="437" /><p id="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Pitch-perfect Audio</strong></em></p></div>
<p>To test the video playback abilities of the Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop, we ran a set of HD, Full HD, and 4K content on it, to which the laptop responded really well. The detailing of the screen and the sound quality were simply superb thanks to its powerful speakers and bright display panel.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>This laptop is certainly not designed specifically for gaming but one can always run some old games on this laptop with great ease. Designed to leverage people with an exceptional working experience, this laptop is packed with specifications that can run some of your most favorite games with great ease. The laptop may lose when it comes to graphic output capacity because of lack of dedicated cards but the quality is certainly not poor. That said, it can run quite a good menu of games from the market, and being powered by the Windows 10 OS, the laptop supports a wide-range of games and apps to choose from. The modern games from the current market catalogue are also pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to checkout &#8211; <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA is packed with a 38-Whr-polymer battery which performans 2.5 times better than the standard Li-ion battery. It was compulsory for this laptop to have a long lasting battery because of the Full HD display that it is fitted with. The exceptional battery-life is going to make easier for people to go on and on without looking for a charger every now and then. The Li-polymer battery retains its 80% charge capacity even after completing hundreds of charge cycles. The battery also complies with the highest safety standards, which makes it radiation proof. During our usage, the laptop lasted for slightly over 6 hours, under heavy usage and it gets charged from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours, which is rather good.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<div id="attachment_2407" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-image-2407 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ASUS-F556UA-AB54-NB-15.622-FHD-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop Review" width="550" height="393" /><p id="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Asus F556UA emerges as winner when it comes to processing power, quality entertainment and leveraging healthier experience but fails to impress people with storage capacity.</p>
<p>The top-notch performance with audio-video output is going to win hearts and make people crave for more and more. We are pretty impressed with Asus F556UA when it comes to audio-video experience; we love the way it makes it easier for people to continue binge-watching movies without feeling restrained.</p>
<p>Like every other laptop in market, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is also not the perfect laptop. It has little dim display and the storage provided on the laptop is also not adequate for most of the users but if you&#8217;re fine with these cons then it is one of the best laptop you can buy in $700 price range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS ROG has been playing a prominent role in the gaming laptops arena since a while now. The brand is very well known to provide powerful gaming laptops under its ROG (Republic Of Gamers) series in various budget segments. Accordingly, our current contender, the ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD is a close to $1000 gaming laptop, which not only looks attractive but also provides an attractive set of features and specifications.</p>
<p>Although you won&#8217;t be getting a ground staggering gaming beast at this point, but you definitely get quite a lot more than what you pay for. The laptop is also one of the very first laptops from the ASUS ROG series to come with an RGB-backlit keyboard, which gives an absolute gaming hue to the laptop. All these styling aspects and powerful configuration of the laptop, made us pick this for our review, and here is what we think of it:</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Asus ROG Strix GL553VD comes in a furious looking blend of black and orange coloured chassis, which gives it all the necessary gaming look, one would expect from a gaming laptop. The laptop is made up of all plastic chassis, which, however, feels of superior quality and feels sturdy. The laptop’s lid sports a pair of orange strips running across the ROG logo, which gives a slightly different look from its predecessors. The bottom of the laptop comes with rubber feet, to give an extra grip even at inclined and smooth surfaces.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2096" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD Gaming Laptop Build Quality Review" width="600" height="547" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review-300x274.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review-50x46.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking of the measurements and weight of the laptop, it weighs around 5.5 pounds and comes with dimensions of 15.1 x 10 x 1.2 inches. The laptop measures just like any of the usual 15.6-inch laptop in the market. As per the measurements, the laptop isn&#8217;t heavy or bulky to carry around. However, that said, it&#8217;s not pretty light either.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD - Thinness" width="600" height="622" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-289x300.jpg 289w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-48x50.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking about the alignment of ports on the laptop, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, and a couple of USB 3.0 ports, a USB type-C port, and a headphone jack on the left end. Towards the right end, it comes with a single USB 2.0 port, a DVD drive, and a locking slot. The laptop comes with an SD card reader towards the lower end of the keyboard and is located just beneath the palm rest.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the GL553VD is a completely redesigned one. It is now a RGB lighting keyboard which Asus calls it as a <em>Aura lighting keyboard</em>. The lights on the keyboard can be customised through the pre-installed Asus keyboard color adjustment software. As far as typing is concerned, the keys on keyboard are spacious and gives very nice tactile feedback while typing. The key travel distance is also 2.5mm which is standard and good for the &#8220;gaming laptop&#8217;s keyboard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Overall, the all-matte black finish on the laptop makes this laptop look extremely stylish and thanks to its well-built ergonomics, the laptop feels easy to hold and carry around.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD gaming laptop sports a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS-like display panel and comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. The laptop comes with a wide view of 178 degrees, which we felt was pretty good in the real time usage. Moreover, the panel gets equipped with a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is also a good aspect for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2100" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-image-2100 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Display Review" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-caption-text">15.6 Inch Full HD Matte Finish 178 Degree Wide View Display</p></div>
<p>The blacks on the display were punchy, and almost all the colours were pretty accurate. The display on the laptop has got the right amount of contrasts, one would be needing in gaming and other viewing experiences. The best part about the display we felt during the review was the colour consistency which was pretty uniform even from extreme positions. And although the laptop doesn&#8217;t come with an anti-glare coating, it does resist reflections and glare on the screen. These aspects of the display qualifies this <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/">laptop for photo editing</a> and also for other works where color accuracy of the display is  important.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a 17-inch variant of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL753VD</em> which comes with exactly the same specs as this laptop but it sports a bigger 17.3 inch display. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a bigger laptop to play games then you can go with GL753VD, which will cost you around $30 bucks more than the current model. | <a title="Recommended Laptop Retailer - Amazon.com" href="http://amzn.to/2mcYSJj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL753VD 17.3 Inch Gaming Laptop</strong></em></a>.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Now with all that said about the design and display of this power-packed gaming laptop, let&#8217;s dive into the hardware specifications of the Strix GL553VD. Speaking about the innards of this laptop, the ASUS ROG Strix comes with an equally powerful set of hardware configuration. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th gen intel core i7 processor paired with an abundant 16GB of RAM. The quad-core i7 kaby lake processor is clocked at 2.8GHz and can turbo boost up to 3.8GHz, making sure that, multiple demanding applications run on the laptop with ease. Graphics on the laptop are bolstered and are handled really well by newer Pascal based NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card.</p>
<div id="attachment_2101" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-image-2101 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD Hardware Review" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-300x180.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-50x30.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-caption-text">Next-Generation Performance | New NVidia GeForce GTX Pascal Based Graphics &amp; Kaby Lake CPU</p></div>
<p>As far as the storage on the laptop is concerned, it is backed by a 1TB of HDD with a speed of 7200RPM. The laptop also comes with a DVD drive to read and write CD/DVDs. Upgrading this laptop is also fairly easy. The RAM is easily accessible and it can be upgraded up to 32GB. Even storage drive of this laptop can be upgraded but that is the little complicated process and you may void the warranty if you do this on your own.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another model of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL553VE</em> which has slightly more powerful GPU and faster SSD storage. To be accurate, it has powerful NVidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti Graphics and it offers 1TB of 7200RPM hard drive and an extra 256GB of SSD storage which vastly improves the gaming performance of the laptop. Of-course, this added performance will come by spending some extra money! | <strong><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2naefqf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL553VE Gaming Laptop</em></a></strong>.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<div id="attachment_2102" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-image-2102 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD - Webcam" width="600" height="247" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-300x124.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-caption-text">With HD Webcam You Can Stream Your Game Play with Friends or on YouTube</p></div>
<p>We never focus a primary light on this aspect of a laptop, especially if it is a gaming-stationed one. However, we understand that the webcam on a laptop should be serviceable for occasional video calls. Thankfully, the 720p camera on the Strix manages to take decent images and is pretty serviceable for video calls. However, the images captured are not very sharp and tends to get blurry at times. The image adjusts quickly on the screen, which we felt was very good for video calling.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<div id="attachment_2104" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-image-2104 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Ports &amp; Slots" width="700" height="209" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots.jpg 700w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-300x90.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-610x182.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-600x179.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-caption-text">Reversible USB Type-C Port with Hyper Fast Data Transfer Speeds</p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a long list of ports and connectivity options to accommodate additional peripherals (gaming accessories). It sports a couple of USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port. In addition to that, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, a <strong>USB Type-C port</strong>, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Unlike most of the current laptops, it comes with a DVD drive, which read/writes data from DVDs and CDs. The laptop also houses an SD card slot to transfer files back and forth between memory card and laptop.</p>
<h4>Software</h4>
<p>Asus has preloaded its Strix laptop with the right fusion of gaming beneficiary software, which is high on productivity and gaming aspects. The laptop comes with Windows 10 preloaded on the software front, and also comes equipped with the ASUS&#8217;s proprietary ROG gaming centre.</p>
<p>This gives games a whole new level of overall performance increase and also keeps the laptop’s temperature in control even after heavy gaming. The ROG gaming centre properly utilises the CPU and GPU performances and provides the most of the both. In addition to this, this laptop also includes alternatives to boost up the exhaust speeds and disable the Windows key during gaming.</p>
<p>The laptop comes preloaded with almost all the Windows 10 apps and features and is, therefore, an equally able laptop in terms of overall productivity.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD comes with a fully-loaded future-proof set of specifications and hardware. So evidently, we expect top class performance from the laptop. We put this laptop to test, to check out whether it can really provide us with the performance we expect from a gaming beast of this calibre. And here is what we found:</p>
<p>The laptop runs absolutely smooth and does a great job in multitasking. During our entire review, we never faced any performance related hiccups, and the laptop was able to handle almost everything we threw at it. Thanks to its latest 7th gen Intel core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM, the Strix delivers impeccable performance. We multitasked the laptop with Chrome running around 15 tabs simultaneously, a 4K video running in the background, a benchmarking app loaded and was connected to WiFI all the time. The laptop was able to handle them all with ease.</p>
<p>For the overall performance of the laptop, we tested it with Geekbench 3, in which the laptop notched a score of 14,120, which is absolutely great for a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptop priced $1000</a>. As far as the gaming is concerned, the in-house 4GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU is a show-stealer here. The laptop can handle almost all the modern games even the graphics set to maximum. However, you&#8217;ll feel that smooth lag-free gaming with more than 35-40fps when you play them with graphics set to medium. We played GTA V on high graphics mode and the laptop although responded very well to the games, we personally felt that it did a better job when graphics were set to medium.</p>
<p>All that said, The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD unarguably provides a beastly performance for the asking price.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop easily handled almost all formats of video content. We tested it with 4K, Full HD, and HD videos and the Strix GL553VD handled them all with ease. However, it was the audio quality, which failed to reach our expectations. The audio felt muffled at times and was not detailed on the notes. At maximum volume, we felt a crackling like sounds, which disappointed us.</p>

<p>Audio on the laptop is also a bit thin and weak when compared to its rivals in the price segment. However, the sound output on the laptop is still serviceable. Thanks to the preinstalled ICEpower AudioWizard software programs tuning audio was easy.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Like most of the gaming laptops these days, ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD also comes with a pretty mediocre battery life, and you&#8217;ll have to carry your power adapter if you take Strix anywhere out. The laptop is powered by a non-removable 4-cells 48 WHr battery, which lasted for just over 4 hours for us on our usage. This included casual web browsing, online videos streaming, few benchmarking apps, and some gaming. The laptop takes around 3 hours to get fully charged from 0 to 100. All in all, the battery backup of this laptops isn&#8217;t groundbreaking and is strictly average. We seriously felt this was an area the laptop was lagging behind its rivals to an extent.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

The laptop also provides very good performance and gaming experience. The only aspects which are a let down in this laptop are its battery life and audio output. However, on an overall note, the laptop is a complete show stealer, when compared to its rivals and is, therefore, our choice of gaming laptop if your budget is around $1000.</p>
