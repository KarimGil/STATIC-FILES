										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Gigabyte gaming laptops garnered a lot of attention at CES 2019, and it&#8217;s not only because the Aorus 15 and Aero 15 are both set to receive noteworthy hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>Released in collaboration with Microsoft, the new Gigabyte gaming laptops will feature the Microsoft Azure AI. This industry-first artificial intelligence was programmed to fully optimize the laptop&#8217;s performance based on the user&#8217;s previous pattern of use.</p>
<h2>Gigabyte Gives the Aorus 15 a Price Cut and a Modest Spec Bump</h2>
<p>Compared to its more expensive predecessors, the Aorus 15 will be priced relatively cheaper, putting it firmly within the mainstream range. However, make no mistake, this laptop retains the same premium aesthetics and performance &#8212; just without the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>Featuring the Microsoft Azure AI, where if enabled, will pull data from previously stored information on the software that you&#8217;re currently using and will optimize everything necessary for ideal performance, whether you&#8217;re playing video games or processing media.</p>
<div id="attachment_5190" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5190" class=" wp-image-5190" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aorus-15-with-RTX.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15 with RTX GPUs and Microsoft Azure AI" width="715" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5190" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>At its most expensive configuration, users can opt to equip the Aorus 15 with the latest Intel Core i7-8750H processor; an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU; 16GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 32GB); and finally, two 2TB of fast SSD storage to give you all of the space that you could possibly ever need.</p>
<p>Weighing at just over 5 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Aorus 15 is not the sleekest nor the lightest gaming laptop. However, it is beautiful. In particular, half of the &#8220;under chassis&#8221; is full of heat pipes and fans. This gives the laptop a premium look, more akin to that of a luxury sports car&#8217;s engine.</p>
<p>Other features include a 15.6-inch Full HD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, a three-zone RGB lighting keyboard, Windows precision drivers for the touchpad, as well as the NAHIMIC audio software for a truly immersive gaming experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500</a></strong></p>
<h2>The Gigabyte Aero 15 Is One of the Smartest Gaming Laptops Around</h2>
<p>Specced out to its maximum configuration, the Aero 15 will come equipped with the Intel Core i9-8950HK; a top-of-the-line Nvidia GTX 2080 MAX-Q GPU; 32GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 64GB); and two 2TB SSDs to satisfy all of your storage needs.</p>
<p>Lighter and slimmer compared to the Aorus 15, the Aero 15 weighs just shy of 5 pounds. It&#8217;s also markedly thinner at just 0.74 inches thick. To match the svelte nature of the laptop, Gigabyte equipped the Aero 15 with a 15.6-inch display with ultra thin bezels. Users can choose to configure the monitor to come at 3840 x 2160 resolution (or 4K), and cover a whopping 100% of the Adobe RGB spectrum for maximum eye candy.</p>
<div id="attachment_5191" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5191" class="size-full wp-image-5191" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aero-15-2019-with-RTX-and-Azure-AI.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aero 15 2019 with RTX GPU and Azure AI" width="497" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-5191" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>Speaking of eye candy, users can customize each key on the keyboard. The Aero 15 comes decked out with a fully customizable RGB keyboard.</p>
<p>Of course, similar to its thicker and bulkier cousin, the Aero 15 will also feature the industry-first Microsoft Azure AI. This means, from the CPU and GPU to the RGB backlit keyboard, fans, and even sound effect settings, the software can optimize everything to fit user preferences and all users have to do is to press a single button.</p>
<p>The Gigabyte Aero 15 will also come with other notable features. This includes the long-awaited Windows precision drivers for the touchpad; 7.1 virtual surround sound courtesy of NAHIMIC 3; and batteries that Gigabyte claim can last up to 10 hours on a single charge.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Excited customers won&#8217;t have to wait long to get their hands on the AI-powered Gigabyte gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Both Gigabyte gaming laptops will start shipping at the end of January. The Aorus 15 will start at a more affordable price point of $1,799. Meanwhile, the Aero 15 will start selling for $2,299. The Aero 15 is also available at a discounted price of $2,199 for those who buy two.</p>
