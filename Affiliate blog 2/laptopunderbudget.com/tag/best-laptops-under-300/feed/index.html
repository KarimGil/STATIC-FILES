Although its chassis is made up of full plastic, it is durable and resistant towards the daily wears and tears.</p>
<p>The display on this laptop is one of the best you can get in 300 dollars price range laptops (actually <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 price-range</a>).

It has a quad-core Intel Pentium N5000 processor inside paired with the 4GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The laptop comes&nbsp;with Windows 10 pre-installed, and&nbsp;it&#8217;s hardware handles the basic multitasking with multiple&nbsp;Windows apps and software easily. For storage, this laptop provides just 64GB of eMMC storage which is very low&nbsp;and might be deal breaking for&nbsp;some users, but considering the price of this laptop, its&nbsp;specs are justifiable.</p>
