										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new A12X Bionic chip that Apple has developed is not only the fastest chip that Apple has brought to market but it is also able to beat rival laptops. This is very impressive keeping in mind that the 2018 iPad Pro is a tablet rather than a full-fledged laptop.</p>
<p>Leaked iPad Pro benchmarks show that the new device is able to beat <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i7 powered laptops</a> like the <a title="Dell XPS 13 (2018) Review – Best Windows Ultrabook Money can Buy" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/dell-xps-13-2018-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell XPS 13</a> and Apple MacBook Pro. <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/10567048" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Geekbench test</a> mentions an iPad 8.8 which seems to be the 2018 iPad Pro that comes with 1TB of storage and 6GB of RAM.</p>
<p>According to the 2018 iPad Pro benchmarks, the device was able to score 5030 points in the single-core test and 17995 points in the multi-core test. This is very impressive keeping in mind that the 8th Gen Intel Core i7-based 13-inch MacBook Pro scored 17,348 points in the multi-core benchmark. The iPad Pro also beats the XPS 13 that scored 14,180. The XPS 13 is powered by the Core i7-8550U.</p>
<p>While the margin between the 2018 iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro is small, there is a significant difference when compared to the XPS 13. You can check out the iPad Pro benchmark below:</p>
<div id="attachment_4541" style="width: 1086px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4541" class="wp-image-4541 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2132132.png" alt="2018 iPad Pro Benchmarks" width="1076" height="693" /><p id="caption-attachment-4541" class="wp-caption-text">2018 iPad Pro Benchmarks</p></div>
<p>Apple claimed that the A12X Bionic chip in the new 2018 iPad Pro made it more powerful than 92% of all portable PCs and that is what we see here. The numbers are remarkable and it is interesting to see what kind of power Apple can get out of its devices when it uses its own proprietary chips.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the Core i9-based 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro was able to score 23,138. The older A10X Fusion-based 2017 model 12.9-inch iPad Pro scored 9,414 points in Geekbench.</p>
<p>These are leaked numbers so you need to take them with a grain of salt. We have to wait till the 2018 iPad Pro is released so that third-parties can run their tests and find out whether or not these numbers are indeed true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the much-awaited <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-hold-us-ipad-pro-2018/">event of the Fall</a> finally happened today. As expected, we got a completely revamped MacBook Air and two improved iPad Pros for businesses, creators and design professionals.</p>
<p>Apple debuted 11.5 inch and 12.9 inch iPad Pro designs in their <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">October event</a> today. Both leaps and bounds ahead of the previous iPad models in terms of body, display, design and specs. Here is everything you need to know about the new and improved iPad Pros.</p>
<p>You can find our complete coverage on the MacBook Air from <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/new-2018-apple-macbook-air-announced/">this</a> article.</p>
<h3>Chassis design and Display</h3>
<p>The 11.5 inch display comes with the same proportion and footprint as the 10.5 inch model. The latter 12.9 inch iPad has been remodeled to fit an even smaller form factor than the previous. The Pros are 5.9mm in thickness, chopping down just 1mm from the slightly heavier iPad Pro.</p>
<p>For the screens, the iPad Pros are not given a complete edge to edge designs much like the iPhone X which is kind of a buzzkill, but it does come close. The bezels on the iPad Pros 2018 are much slimmer and debut new full-screen displays as well. The removal of the Home button also contributes to the larger view and are the first iPads to be launched without Touch ID. Eliminating the infinity display out of the equation, the iPad Pros do take after the iPhone XR&#8217;s quality of Liquid Retina display, the iPhone X&#8217;s gesture navigation, and the True Depth camera setup.</p>
<p>Also, not forgetting the most exciting addition of all &#8211; the Face ID. This one was much awaited to be introduced in the iPads after their massive success in the iPhones. Face ID brings a lot of fun features with itself such as the Animoji, Memoji, amongst others like Apple Pay.</p>
<div id="attachment_4516" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4516" class="wp-image-4516 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ipad_pro_notchless.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-4516" class="wp-caption-text">Apple iPad Pro&#8217;s notchless design | Image &#8211; The Verge</p></div>
<p>To our surprise, the camera for the Face ID and the sensors sit on the top of the bezel instead of the notch &#8211; another take on the iPhone X. So, if the iPad is connected with the Smart keyboard, the Face ID will be functional in landscape orientation.</p>
<h3>Horsepower and CPU</h3>
<p>Apple, for the 2018 iPad Pros has employed their latest A12X Bionic chip with an 8-core CPU and 7-core GPU. Apple putting their latest iPads on the fast track claims that their CPU integrations will give the new iPad Pros 35 percent faster single-core performance and a whopping 90 percent faster multi-core performance. It doesn&#8217;t end here, Apple also boasts that the iPad Pros will deliver 1000 times faster graphics performance. This is a literal game changer!</p>
<p>Apple’s Jon Ternus said;</p>
<blockquote><p>“the iPad Pro delivers Xbox One S class graphics performance in a package that is much smaller.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The battery remains untouched and unblemished maintaining the 10-hour benchmark as usual.</p>
<p>While Apple clings to Lightning connectors for their latest iPhones, they did shy away from it for their new iPads. Turns out that our suspicions for the USB-C connector addition in the iPads were, in fact, correct. This opens tremendous options of connectivity for the new iPads, for instance, connecting to the 5K resolution display and even power an iPhone. Another impressive upgrade is massive 1TB storage. Again, seen for the first time in the 2018 iPad Pros, that is a jump from the past 512GB.</p>
<p>The inclusion of USB-C port, the remarkable CPUs and the outstanding graphics all point towards one thing &#8211; Apple is rooting for their iPads to replace computers. While its a truly commendable effort on their part but the iPads still have a long way to go for qualifying from PC &#8216;alternatives&#8217; to PC &#8216;replacements&#8217;.</p>
<p>Both iPad Pro models also feature Bluetooth 5.0 and Smart HDR along with Gigabit LTE, an 18W charging brick but of course the headphone jack was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<h3>Smart Keyboard &#8216;Folio&#8217; and Apple Pencil accessories</h3>
<p>No upgrade is fun enough if it does not come with some exciting new add-ons. So, of course there are some accessories in the mix in the new iPad Pro launch.</p>
<div id="attachment_4519" style="width: 687px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4519" class="wp-image-4519" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ipad_pencil.jpg" alt="" width="677" height="451" /><p id="caption-attachment-4519" class="wp-caption-text">iPad Pro Pencil wireless charging | Image &#8211; The Verge</p></div>
<p>A whole new and upgraded Apple Pencil was unveiled that wakes the device when tapped on the screen and launches Notes. The tap gesture of the stylus is completely customizable with third party apps. Like in Photoshop, a single tap can trigger a zooming shortcut on the canvas. The charging method is pretty cool too and can be powered up by magnetically attaching itself on top of the device instead of having to plug it in the common way. To give the Stylus more balance, Apple has gone for a square cut design as it will be much easier to place the pencil on the iPad with a flat body or any other surface for that matter. The flat edge design coupled with a modern matte finish makes the stylus even easier to hold and use.</p>
<p>Speaking of magnetic attachment, the iPad keyboard has been given a major upgrade too. Unlike the previous ones, the new Smart keyboard Folio does not rely on the Smart connector and can work with magnetic attachment to the device. It also has the ability to adjust itself into two different typing angles and is a lot more than just a cover that folds out into a keyboard.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>The 11.5 inch iPad is priced from $799 (64GB) and the slightly larger 12.9-inch priced from $999. If you choose to opt for the 1TB and LTE with the 12.9-inch model, the cost goes all the way up to $1,899.</p>
<p>As for the accessories, Apple has announced that their new Smart Keyboard Folio, Smart Folio, and the USB-C to SD Card reader are available now for pre-order. The Smart Keyboard Folio for the 11-inch iPad Pro would cause a total damage of $179, and the 12.9-inch version runs up to $199. The Smart Keyboard for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro costs $159 and excludes the front and back coverage unlike the newer ones. The Apple Pencil costs around $130.</p>
<p>The new iPads are expected to be available sometime before the holidays. November 7th to be precise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the release of iOS 12, it has been widely believed that Apple will be holding a Fall event for revealing some of its latest innovations. From Apple holding back on iPad devices in their September release event to the subtle reference in iOS 12.1 of &#8216;iPad2018Fall&#8217;, we are quite sure that we see a new iPad Pro somewhere between October and November.</p>
<h5>A very cool display</h5>
<p>After the massive success of edge-to-edge screens on the iPhone X, it only makes sense that Apple might want to expand its obtainability. The 2018 refresh of iPad Pro is rumored to lose the Home button and include the slim bezels as well. Which of course, comes with the edge to edge package.</p>
<p>Although the overall size of the screen is still a mystery, Apple did accommodate bigger screen with the same footprint in their iPhone X. We are hoping for the same to be the case with iPad Pro 2018.</p>
<h5>It reads your face</h5>
<p>The rumored use of Face ID is also an interesting addition &#8211; similar to the latest iPhones. It will probably be using the same image signal processor as the iPhone XS. Despite the extra slim bezels, Apple has managed to adjust a TrueDepth camera system necessary for Face ID recognition and that too without a notch.</p>
<p>The Face ID will be able to work in portrait and landscape modes (a feature that is still lacking in the iPhones) but will be useless when the device is held upside down. Doesn&#8217;t seem like a problem, to be honest. Who uses their device upside down?</p>
<p lang="en"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>UPDATE: 10/26/18</strong></span></p>
<p lang="en">As posted by <span class="FullNameGroup"><a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1055580110236147713"><strong class="fullname show-popup-with-id u-textTruncate ">Guilherme Rambo</strong>‏</a><span class="UserNameBreak"> in a tweet</span></span>, the face ID feature is confirmed to work in both orientations. The leak references<span class="FullNameGroup"><span class="UserNameBreak"> a few lines of code from the setup of iOS 12.1 beta that calls for the users to &#8220;Lift and Rotate iPad&#8221;. This is a part of Apple’s device setup app that would allow users to unlock their iPads in both landscape and portrait orientations. </span></span></p>
<p>An option of &#8220;Set up Later in Settings&#8221; is also provided to allow users to change their preferences after the initial setup is complete.</p>
<h5>Bye Lightning port and Hello 4K streaming</h5>
<p>A risque move by Apple is getting rid of their Lightning connector, according to sources. Bringing the USB-C into the picture, the iPad Pro will be able to support fast charging and output 4K HDR video to external displays.  The settings panel will allow users to control the usability and accessibility of the external devices. However, the thought of using those irritating dongles for connecting various devices might leave a bad taste in your mouth. But it does give the iPad a very PC like experience.</p>
<p>Moreover, its an appreciable upgrade since the previous versions of the tablet were only able to push 1080p HD video to external displays. That too using the £49 ($49) Lightning Digital AV Adapter accessory.</p>
<h5>The pencil is new too</h5>
<p>The pencil is one of the very compelling accessories by Apple. Tweaking its design can go either amazingly right or disappointingly wrong. From the rumors although, it seems like the Pencil for iPad Pro will be free of the Lightning cable bounds. Like the AirPods, it will be connected through proximity. It only makes so much sense &#8211; a pencil away from a certain distance from the device is useless anyway.</p>
<h5>A Magnetic Connector on the back</h5>
<p>Turns out that for even more accessibility, Apple is expected to be adding a magnetic connector at the back of the device for connecting certain external accessories. This brand new addition will be able to work with almost every third-party iPad accessory, for instance, the Smart Keyboard.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>UPDATE: 10/12/18</strong></span></p>
<h5>The fastest in the race:</h5>
<p>New reports have resurfaced regarding the processing power of the rumored tablet. According to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/10/2018-ipad-pro-details-face-id-display/">9to5Mac </a>Apple is planning on embedding the A12X chip in their next iPad Pro update. Now if this update is legit, this would mean that the iPad Pro might just have knocked iPhone X and iPhone XS over (using the A12 processor) as the fastest Apple devices.</p>
<p>Its also speculated that the A12 processor will be accompanied with an even powerful A12 X GPU which is a cherry on top. According to past reports, the A12 X processor is codenamed  &#8220;Vortex&#8221;. The name Apple usually accredits it processors are synonymous to of the word &#8216;wind&#8217; like Zephyr or Bionic. The A12 and A12X being given a slightly significant title might just be an indication about their out of the box performance. We have already seen the A12 capabilities with the latest iPhone X series and it&#8217;s just as good as Apple claimed it would be. The A12X being an upgrade would only mean that Apple will be surpassing the expectations of its users once again.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>UPDATE: 10/16/18</strong></span></p>
<h5>The slimmest yet but with a catch</h5>
<p>According to the latest leaks regarding Apple&#8217;s upcoming iPad Pro 2018, it&#8217;s going to overthrow the already sleek iPad Pro 10.5 from 6.1 mm to an impressive 5.9mm. If true, this is going to be a historical unveiling in all of Apple releases as this is the slimmer they have ever gone with a tablet or a phone for that matter.</p>
<p>The trimming of thickness as expected does not come without shedding a few features. With Apple running wild with eliminating all kinds of ports, the 3.5mm headphone jack was it for the iPad Pro 2018. The source of this new information is Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/coiiiiiiiin/status/1050821076790300672">CoinCoin. </a>He has managed to maintain a proven track record in releasing reliable Apple leaks and started some of them back in September regarding the iPhone XS.</p>
<div class="js-tweet-text-container">
<blockquote>
<p class="TweetTextSize TweetTextSize--jumbo js-tweet-text tweet-text" lang="en">Of course no headphone jack on the upcoming new iPad. 5.9mm thickness is pretty good though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p lang="en">The change might not be a major shock to iPad users as true Apple lovers have already borne through the loss with iPhone 7 back in 2016. Considering the company&#8217;s massive profit drivers have been their AirPods and wearables devices, it was only a matter of time until Apple decided to adopt the same design with their iPads.</p>
<p lang="en">Much like the handset series, it appears that Apple users will be handling the same dongle baggage with iPads as well in 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more in the making&#8221; is what Apple is tag lining their upcoming event with. This &#8216;sort of&#8217; teaser has sparked a lot of excitement among Apple lovers. The company has already held a gigantic and successful Apple event a little over a month ago in which they released their latest iPhones and Apple Watch. Seems like Apple isn&#8217;t planning on going out of the spotlight anytime soon.</p>
<p>The date Apple has set for Apple’s <a title="Apple Event" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent fall event</a> is October 30, taking place at the <a href="https://www.bam.org/about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Howard Gilman Opera House </a>in New York City. That&#8217;s right, the venue is different too unlike the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino where they held their previous event in September.</p>
<p>Although, this is not a complete surprise. There have been rumors about the<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-hold-us-ipad-pro-2018/"> iPad revamp</a> since forever and was long overdue as well. It only made sense that Apple would come around this year work on their abandoned tablet series that hadn&#8217;t received a major update since over a year. Apart from the iPad Pro (the most certain unveiling), there are a few more innovations that we are expecting to be a part of this event.</p>
<h3>What could be &#8216;in the making&#8217;?</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s our take on what Apple users should be expecting in the 30 Oct reveal.</p>
<h4>The iPad Pro (of course)</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4282" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/https_2F2Fblogs-images.forbes.com2Fdavidphelan2Ffiles2F20182F092FiPad-Pro-12-9-2018-5K1-1068x580.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="298" /></p>
<p>We are expecting a dual iPad Pro reveal from Apple to make up for the lost time. The 11-inch size and a redesigned 12.9-inch size iPad. The size variety may come with the introduction to Face ID, USB C port, and a notch less design but with the loss of Touch ID and Smart Connector.</p>
<h4>The MacBook</h4>
<p>The 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pros were updated back in July without any formal event. Nonetheless, we do expect at least 1 major <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/macbook-air-upgrade-apple-fall-event/">MacBook update</a> to be a part of their fall get together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>We think that Apple might replace their customary 12-inch MacBook with a 13-inch version. According to past resurfaced reports, the company is aiming at keeping the range between $1000-$1500  with the inclusion of Touch ID and the exclusion of Touch Bar.</p>
<h4>The iMac</h4>
<p>The new hardware of the improved iMac is said to have “significant display-performance upgrades”.</p>
<p>According to past rumors, the MacBook Pro might include the True Tone display support. This allows an adjustment to the color temperature based on lighting ambiance, although it’s still debatable if it only refers to True Tone on the iMac.</p>
<h4>The Mac mini</h4>
<p>Among all outdated Apple devices, the Mac mini certainly takes the cake. Still possessing the 2014 hardware, the Mac mini could be bumped up majorly according to rumors that were circulated in August 2018.</p>
<p>Apple will be focusing on facilitating the needs of Pro users in their 2018 refresh according to Mark Gurman and Debby Wu. Like every other Apple upgrade, higher specs mean higher prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is also planning the first upgrade to the Mac mini in about four years. It’s a Mac desktop that doesn’t include a screen, keyboard, or mouse in the box and costs $500. The computer has been favored because of its lower price, and it’s popular with app developers, those running home media centers, and server farm managers. For this year’s model, Apple is focusing primarily on these pro users, and new storage and processor options are likely to make it more expensive than previous versions, the people said.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The AirPods and AirPower</h4>
<p>Techies are expecting Apple to come forward with their previously announced AirPower wireless charging pad and the wireless charging case for AirPods earphones.</p>
<p>The company teased the reveal in September with an updated version of AirPods including Hey Siri support before the event. The products were surprisingly not mentioned in the following event and yet remain to be seen.</p>
<h4>The OS updates</h4>
<p>Apple might grab the opportunity to release details about their latest OS updates that have been in Beta testing since September. Yes, we are expecting the debut of the iOS 12.1 and the macOS 10.14.1.</p>
<p>With these updates, Apple might release the long-awaited multi-caller Group Face time feature and audio chats. This, along with the support for dual SIM functionality that is going to enable the Series 4’s EKG functionality.</p>
<p>The watchOS may too be getting ahead and include the  ECG support for U.S. Apple Watch users.</p>
