										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 has been one of our most recommended gaming laptops since it was launch in 2017. We got a revision in 2018 with some changes in internals, but it was a mere spec bump as the chassis did not see anything new. In 2019, Acer has remastered it’s best selling machine by giving it a complete design overhaul and revamped thermals which Acer claims will lead to a significant difference in the experience of an average gamer.</p>
<p>When put to the test, the new Predator Helios 300 does deliver the claims made by the company while still keeping the price near to $1000. The new design appeals a look which is more modern than ever, the spec sheet with the Core i7 9750H hexa core processor and Nvidia’s Turing graphics ticks all the checkboxes and leaves nothing more to be desired. The new cooling solution also seems to help a lot. Overall, on the performance front, Acer has delivered the no-nonsense gaming machine which every gamer always asked for.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design is the most improved aspect of this machine. The 2019 Predator Helios 300 has an entirely new blue design which calls for a breath of fresh air after years of generic red and black gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The laptop has an aluminum top surface and deck, which combined with the sturdy hinge, provide the feel of strong build quality. It does add a little bit of weight though, the laptop weighs 5.1 lbs (2.3 kg) which is not light by any means, but it is slightly lighter and slimmer than the <a title="Acer Predator Helios 300 Review (PH315-51-78NP) – Breaking Stereotypes of Budget Gaming Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-review-ph315-51/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous generation</a>. It is still on the bulkier side but in line with the competition and portable enough to carry in a backpack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5868 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-2019-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 (2019) Gaming Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="680" height="400" /></p>
<p>The design is ergonomic and minimalist. The only problem I faced was that the outline is a little angular which caused some trouble while typing and needs getting used to. Apart from that, the overall new design language by Acer was a much needed change and will be appreciated by every user.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 houses a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS display, which has a refresh rate of 144 Hz and a response time of 3ms. On-paper, the display is on par with the other <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costly gaming laptops</a> out there.</p>
<p>The thin bezels add to the clean design language that Acer is going for. The 79% screen-to-body ratio provides the laptop with a sleek and modern look. They are not super-thin, so it can house the webcam up top unlike modern ultrabooks even though nobody is going to use it because it’s only good enough for video calls as there is no Windows Hello support.</p>
<div id="attachment_5871" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-image-5871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL 1080p 144Hz Display Review" width="612" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Best Display in Sub-$1000 Gaming Laptops Category</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The color accuracy is better than average with 97% SRGB and 75% ARGB color gamut. It’s not <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect for color accurate work</a>, but more than enough for a great gaming experience. The peak brightness of the panel was recorded at 343 nits which should result in good visibility outdoors.</p>
<p>The panel does suffer from backlight bleed issues. It is not the same on all the laptops and will depend totally on luck if your panel is unusable in a worst-case scenario. Backlight bleed does not affect gaming or reading text a lot, where it’s most noticeable is movies that have black bars on the corners of the screen.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard and trackpad are the most easily underlooked parts in <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptops</a>. The keyboard on this laptop is similar on the inside as the last year’s model. Even though it looks different with the blue accents and RGB backlighting, the underlying functionality and the layout is the same for the most part.</p>
<div id="attachment_5873" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-image-5873 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Trackpad.jpg" alt="2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Trackpad Review" width="750" height="484" /><p id="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>White Backlit Keyboard with Blue Accent</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Small improvements are made to the keyboard like increased key travel distance and 4 zone RGB backlight instead of the red backlight from last year. Some lower configurations don’t have the complete customizable RGB backlighting but only a subtle white light which is still better than red.</p>
<p>The trackpad has a plastic surface; it is inferior to glass trackpads but does the job. It does not suffer any hiccups or misreads thanks to windows precision drivers. The size is also good enough. Both the trackpad and keyboard are easy to get used to, and most people will find them comfortable to use without any complaints.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The new Acer Predator Helios 300 features the same specifications as any other $1200 gaming laptop in 2019, a hexa-core i7-9750H CPU that can boost up to 4.5 GHz on a single core and 4.0 GHz on all cores, 16GB of dual-channel memory and Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics with 6GB of GDDR6 virtual memory.</p>
<p>However, the spec sheet is not where it’s at. The optimization and tuning done by Acer take this laptop one step ahead of the competition. It comes factory-undervolted, which allows the CPU to maintain boost clock while sucking less power and generating less heat as a result. The ‘Turbo’ button overclocks the GPU and runs the fans at max speed to get the most out of the machine. Acer has taken care of every small detail which allows this laptop to edge out the competition. One thing to note here is that Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti comes in a few different configurations meant for different form factor designs. The Predator Helios 300 houses a full 80W TDP configuration of the GTX 1660 Ti. It’s safe to say it is the most powerful GTX 1660 Ti laptop out there.</p>

<p>The rest of the components are pretty well balanced; there are a few storage options to choose from. You can configure the laptop on Amazon with either a 256GB or a 512GB NVMe SSD. The read and write speeds are similar to most NVMe SSDs out there. On the inside, there are 2x SODIMM memory slots, 2x M.2 drive slots and an empty 2.5-inch drive bay to add a SATA SSD or a spinning HDD of your choice. Ram, storage and WiFi card can easily be upgraded by opening only a few screws. Acer has ensured the machine is very user-friendly to upgrade and service.</p>

<p>Gaming performance is where the 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 shines; it manages to stick out from the stack of all GTX 1660 Ti laptops by beating every single one of them. The dual-channel memory helps to achieve better 1% lows, and the experience is seamless. The CPU stayed at peak boost frequency all the time while playing Battlefield V.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of competitive multiplayer titles, dropping the graphics settings a bit can help max out the fps to match the display’s 144 Hz refresh-rate which is the best way to enjoy these titles.</p>
<h3>Thermals &amp; Acoustics</h3>
<p>The two fans, one dedicated to the CPU and GPU each, exhaust air out of the four vents, two on the rear, and two on the sides. Acer has done a great job of keeping this laptop cool by pre-undervolting the CPU. Under full load, the keyboard deck stays under a manageable 50°C. The CPU temperature reached a high of 85°C, and the GPU touched a max of 70°C. These temperatures are easily manageable, and no thermal throttling or power limit throttling was noticed. The testing was done with an ambient temperature of 22°C, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<div id="attachment_5874" style="width: 667px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-image-5874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3D-Aero-Blade-Fans-on-2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="New 3D Aero Blade Fans on 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop" width="657" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Improved 4th Gen 3D Aero Blade Fans for Better Airflow</strong></em></p></div>
<p>If you’re doing any CPU-heavy tasks on this laptop, you’re going to see the best results with the Turbo profile that can be initiated with the Turbo button on the deck. It automatically sets the optimum clock speed for the GPU and provides the CPU 25% more power to work with. It does increase the fan noise to slightly uncomfortable 55dB as it ramps up the fans to max speed. But that’s a sacrifice you’re going to have to make to maximize performance. It’s unnoticeable when you have headphones on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c6c6c6;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#e0e0e0;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Video Editing</a> &#8211; Our Top Picks for Youtubers and Film Editors</strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>On the left, the laptop features a Kensington lock, power connector, an RJ45 ethernet jack, 2x USB 3.1 ports, and a combo headphone jack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5876 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Gaming Laptop Ports and Slots" width="708" height="602" /></p>
<p>On the right, we see a full-size HDMI port, a mini DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.1 port, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port.</p>
<p>The only thing missing here is an SD card slot, which is a bummer for <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative professionals</a> who use SD cards to transfer data to and from cameras. The type-c port, sadly, does not support Thunderbolt 3.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery on this laptop is a 58 Wh unit. Battery backup was recorded at 3-3.5 hours while doing normal tasks like browsing and watching a video with screen brightness at 250 nits and using Nvidia Optimus to force use the integrated Intel graphics. Under load, while gaming or doing any heavy tasks, don’t expect more than 45 minutes of juice out of the small battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5882 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-PH315-52-78VL-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Review - best gaming laptop in $1000 price range" width="628" height="500" /></p>
<p>The 180W AC adapter is fairly large but can be easily managed in a backpack. It adds some weight making the package about 6.1 lbs (2.8 kg) heavy to carry around.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>For $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 provides amazing value when compared to the competition. Not only does this machine outperform every <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other similarly priced laptop</a>, it does so without any compromises. With the out of the box CPU undervolt, Acer has knocked this one out of the park.</p>
<p>The balanced specifications on this laptop make it a good buy for gamers and content creators. It has a good screen, a stellar keyboard, can be easily upgraded, provides excellent gaming performance, and stays cool while doing so. The price drops to below $1100 often, and in the Black Friday sale, it dropped to a lowest of $930, which makes the Predator Helios 300 the best bang for the buck gaming laptop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Gigabyte gaming laptops garnered a lot of attention at CES 2019, and it&#8217;s not only because the Aorus 15 and Aero 15 are both set to receive noteworthy hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>Released in collaboration with Microsoft, the new Gigabyte gaming laptops will feature the Microsoft Azure AI. This industry-first artificial intelligence was programmed to fully optimize the laptop&#8217;s performance based on the user&#8217;s previous pattern of use.</p>
<h2>Gigabyte Gives the Aorus 15 a Price Cut and a Modest Spec Bump</h2>
<p>Compared to its more expensive predecessors, the Aorus 15 will be priced relatively cheaper, putting it firmly within the mainstream range. However, make no mistake, this laptop retains the same premium aesthetics and performance &#8212; just without the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>Featuring the Microsoft Azure AI, where if enabled, will pull data from previously stored information on the software that you&#8217;re currently using and will optimize everything necessary for ideal performance, whether you&#8217;re playing video games or processing media.</p>
<div id="attachment_5190" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5190" class=" wp-image-5190" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aorus-15-with-RTX.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15 with RTX GPUs and Microsoft Azure AI" width="715" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5190" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>At its most expensive configuration, users can opt to equip the Aorus 15 with the latest Intel Core i7-8750H processor; an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU; 16GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 32GB); and finally, two 2TB of fast SSD storage to give you all of the space that you could possibly ever need.</p>
<p>Weighing at just over 5 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Aorus 15 is not the sleekest nor the lightest gaming laptop. However, it is beautiful. In particular, half of the &#8220;under chassis&#8221; is full of heat pipes and fans. This gives the laptop a premium look, more akin to that of a luxury sports car&#8217;s engine.</p>
<p>Other features include a 15.6-inch Full HD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, a three-zone RGB lighting keyboard, Windows precision drivers for the touchpad, as well as the NAHIMIC audio software for a truly immersive gaming experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500</a></strong></p>
<h2>The Gigabyte Aero 15 Is One of the Smartest Gaming Laptops Around</h2>
<p>Specced out to its maximum configuration, the Aero 15 will come equipped with the Intel Core i9-8950HK; a top-of-the-line Nvidia GTX 2080 MAX-Q GPU; 32GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 64GB); and two 2TB SSDs to satisfy all of your storage needs.</p>
<p>Lighter and slimmer compared to the Aorus 15, the Aero 15 weighs just shy of 5 pounds. It&#8217;s also markedly thinner at just 0.74 inches thick. To match the svelte nature of the laptop, Gigabyte equipped the Aero 15 with a 15.6-inch display with ultra thin bezels. Users can choose to configure the monitor to come at 3840 x 2160 resolution (or 4K), and cover a whopping 100% of the Adobe RGB spectrum for maximum eye candy.</p>
<div id="attachment_5191" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5191" class="size-full wp-image-5191" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aero-15-2019-with-RTX-and-Azure-AI.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aero 15 2019 with RTX GPU and Azure AI" width="497" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-5191" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>Speaking of eye candy, users can customize each key on the keyboard. The Aero 15 comes decked out with a fully customizable RGB keyboard.</p>
<p>Of course, similar to its thicker and bulkier cousin, the Aero 15 will also feature the industry-first Microsoft Azure AI. This means, from the CPU and GPU to the RGB backlit keyboard, fans, and even sound effect settings, the software can optimize everything to fit user preferences and all users have to do is to press a single button.</p>
<p>The Gigabyte Aero 15 will also come with other notable features. This includes the long-awaited Windows precision drivers for the touchpad; 7.1 virtual surround sound courtesy of NAHIMIC 3; and batteries that Gigabyte claim can last up to 10 hours on a single charge.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Excited customers won&#8217;t have to wait long to get their hands on the AI-powered Gigabyte gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Both Gigabyte gaming laptops will start shipping at the end of January. The Aorus 15 will start at a more affordable price point of $1,799. Meanwhile, the Aero 15 will start selling for $2,299. The Aero 15 is also available at a discounted price of $2,199 for those who buy two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Dell&#8217;s subsidiary, Alienware, was focused on making headlines, Dell decided to appeal more to the mass consumer at CES 2019, announcing a refresh to their budget-friendly G series gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The next-generation laptops, the Dell G5 15, G7 15 and G7 17, are set to receive upgrades to both its internal components and aesthetics, with the more affordable line of gaming laptops starting to look more like their Alienware cousins.</p>
<h2>Affordability and Power Packed In a 15-inch Chassis</h2>
<div id="attachment_5155" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-image-5155 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>Where most refreshes only touch up on the hardware side of things, Dell also changed up the aesthetics of their G series gaming laptops for 2019. Instead of their more subtle look, they&#8217;re starting to look more like <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/alienware-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware laptops</a>. Case in point, by default, the Dell G7 15 and G5 15 will both come in Deep Space Black color options, decked out with blue-colored accents. Finally, rounding out its look are ridges located right around the border, which Dell presumably put both for aesthetic and functional purposes.</p>
<p>Another laptop, the Dell G5 15 SE, is also available as an upgrade. It features the same specs as the Dell G5 15. However, it comes with an Alpine White chassis and a clear panel on the bottom of the system that showcases the cooling system, which Dell equipped with blue fans.</p>
<p>The key difference between the G5 15 and the G7 15 is that the latter is thinner and weighs less. At just 0.78 inches and 5.77 pounds, the Dell G7 15 has slightly different dimensions compared to the Dell G5 15, which tips the scales at 6.1 pounds and is at least 0.95 inches thick.</p>
<p>Both of these G series gaming laptops come packing with the latest Quad- and Hex-core Cofee Lake Intel processors, as well as mobile versions of NVIDIA&#8217;s RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can opt to upgrade the display of the latest G series gaming laptops. For more eye candy, users can choose a 4K UHD, OLED display. Meanwhile, for serious and competitive gamers, the G5 15 and the G7 15 comes with a 144Hz Full HD display panel as well.</p>
<h2>An Inexpensive i9-Powered, 17-inch Laptop That Packs a Wallop</h2>
<div id="attachment_5156" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-image-5156 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-3.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>From the more budget friendly G series gaming laptops, we go to the slightly more expensive, but still affordable, G7 17.</p>
<p>Weighing at 7.21 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Dell G7 17 is slightly bigger than its 15-inch brothers. Yet, at the same time, it&#8217;s also leaner compared to <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other 17-inch gaming laptops</a>. It also comes with the same Deep Space Black theme as its 15-inch varieties, and unfortunately, won&#8217;t be available in Alpine White.</p>
<p>Powered by the latest Intel Core i9 processor, the G7 17 is dramatically more powerful and faster compared to the G5 15 and the G7 15. However, other specifications, including the NVIDIA RTX graphics cards, which tops out with the RTX 2080, remains the same across all three (or four including the G5 15 SE) gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dell has limited the 17-inch laptop to a Full HD display. However, users can choose to have it equipped with a 144Hz screen for a smoother gameplay experience.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Dell announced that all of the refreshed G series gaming laptops will start shipping on January 21.</p>
<p>The Dell G5 15 will start at $999, with the thinner and lighter Dell G7 15 starting at $1,099, and the Alpine White Dell G5 15 SE being available as an upgrade option. Finally, the Dell G7 17 will start at a $1,379 price point.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design, there isn’t much of an upgrade here. Having said that, the 2018 Helios 300 looks exactly identical to the last year’s model.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Helios 300 at the very first glance looks to be much thinner and compact than that of the other laptops in the segment. However, when you hold the device and start using it, you’ll realize that it, in fact, is on a bulkier side. The device comes with a dimension of 10.47 x 15.35 x 1.05 inches, which is a little wider and thicker for a 15-inch laptop. The device weighs slightly over 5.5 pounds and can be quite cumbersome to carry around. However, considering the fact that it is a gaming laptop and has a lot of engineering within, it might not be an issue for most of us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Design" width="650" height="406" /></p>
<p>Acer this time has come up with newer color variants, to give gamers a choice. It has unveiled the special edition Acer Predator Helios 300, which comes clad in a white-and-gold chassis. However, we still don&#8217;t know when it will hit the stores.</p>
<p>The one which we tested looks just like its predecessor and has the same angular design going all around with red and black color scheme. Its aluminum lid has a huge Predator logo and a red lining on either side which gives it a proper gaming hue, however, it doesn&#8217;t light up like Alienware and some <a title="All MSI Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/msi-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end MSI laptops</a>.</p>
<p>Most gamers would love the design of this laptop, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an out of the box gaming laptop design, then the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) might not please you that much.</p>
<div id="attachment_3941" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Lid-design.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 - Lid design" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Premium looking Metal Lid with Huge Predator Logo and Red Lines on Either Side</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the build quality, there is a lot of plastic used in the making of chassis of this laptop. However, there are no compromises with the build quality and laptop feels very solid to hold. Moreover, it comes with a pretty ergonomic form-factor making it subtle to carry around and use.</p>
<p>As far as ports and slots are concerned, they are neatly recessed on both sides of the laptop and they are smartly placed in a way that wired gaming mouse won&#8217;t hinder your gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Almost all the Acer Predator series of laptops come with a short-stroke keyboard, which might not often be preferred for gaming. The keys on the Helios 300, comes with a travel of the only 1.2mm into the frame on a press, which is not much. This affects the tactile feedback on the keyboard. However, this doesn’t hold true for regular usage including documents editing and other general tasks.</p>
<p>However, the gamers will like the keys on the device as they are very brightly backlit and come in non-changeable red color hue to match the styling. The keys come with a slight curve, which adds on to the typing experience nonetheless.</p>
<div id="attachment_3943" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3943" class="wp-image-3943 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="800" height="491" /><p id="caption-attachment-3943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong><em>Iron Red Backlit Keyboard with 1.2mm Key Travel</em></strong></p></div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><strong><em>You May Like to Check out: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptop for Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</em></strong></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the trackpad on the device, it is made out of plastic and evidently, one can feel that right away. Although the tactile feedback and the touch sensitivity on the trackpad are fine-tuned, we felt the lack of richness, we ought to get on gaming laptops over $1000. However, it can still take up all the everyday essentials with ease without dropping a sweat.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD widescreen display and it is an IPS LED-backlit panel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What makes it unique though is its fast 144Hz refresh rate</span>. Meaning, the rapid refresh rate shortens the time it takes for frame rendering and provides gamers with an excellent in-game experience. This helps especially when you’re gaming or watching the high-quality video files.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3946" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-PH315-51-78NP-144Hz-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP) 144Hz Display Review" width="900" height="667" /></p>
<p>The display can get bright up to 300 nits and produces a decent 70% NTSC and 90% sRGB color gamut on the scale, making it good enough for content creators. We also played some 4K content on the laptop, and the details were very precise, that we could see every minute detail played.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops for Photo Editing with Most Color Accurate Display</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Overall, the display on the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) gaming laptop is one of its unique selling points and without a doubt, it is one of the best display-equipped mid-range gaming laptop available to buy right now.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the hardware of the device, Acer Predator Helios 300 comes with powerful innards, which makes it one of the latest in the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segment of mid-range gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by a latest 8th gen Intel Core i7-8750H hexa-core processor with clock frequency of up to 4.1GHz and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 video memory. The duo of this CPU and GPU makes it one of the most powerful and value for money gaming laptops available for the asking price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops</a> (8th Gen)</strong></em></div></div>
<p>For multitasking, the laptop has a huge 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of PCIe based NVMe SSD. Although this might not be sufficient to store huge data, be mindful, the SSD storage offered in this laptop is at least 4 times faster than that of the traditional HDD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_3947" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Hardware-and-Upgradability.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-78NP Hardware and Upgradability" width="800" height="546" /><p id="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>New Dual Fan Cooling System | Easy to upgrade RAM (Up to 32GB) and Storage</strong> <em>&#8211; Image taken from Dave Lee YouTube Channel</em></p></div>
<p>To the gamers rejoice, hardware on the Predator Helios 300 is quite easy to upgrade. The laptop&#8217;s back panel gives access to its two RAM slots one of which is empty and it also has an empty storage drive bay inside to upgrade its low storage with the hard drive or another SSD. The WiFi card is also easily accessible but we don&#8217;t think it needs to be changed as the Gigabit card that the laptop comes equipped with, works flawlessly and provides excellent WiFi reception.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming stationed laptop, we expect a lot of additional peripherals to be connected to the device. Accordingly, the Helios 300 comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C port which can support speeds of up to 5GBps. It also sports a USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports. There is an HDMI 2.0 port to plug in the additional display if needed. The HDMI port available comes with HDCP support. Apart from these, it also comes with a microSD card reader, an RJ45 Ethernet port, headphone jack, and a charging port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ports-and-Slots-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="800" height="367" /></p>
<p>The only disappointment here is its USB Type-C port which doesn&#8217;t support the Thunderbolt 3. We expected this year&#8217;s model with Thunderbolt 3 as the last year&#8217;s model didn&#8217;t had it. However, it isn&#8217;t a huge problem if you don&#8217;t plan to use the External GPU or other Thunderbolt accessories.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We spent a decent time gaming and doing other mediocre to demanding tasks on this laptop. The laptop stood up to the expectations and did well in terms of providing reliable performance and efficiency. We tested the laptop by <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rendering video</a> on the Adobe Premiere and even played some AAA games at high graphics settings. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop was able to handle our multitasking and gaming tests quite easily.</p>
<p>A gaming laptop is often discredited due to its heating issues but to our surprise, this year&#8217;s Acer Predator Helios 300 did well in terms of thermal management, despite having powerful CPU and GPU inside it. Thanks to its new all-metal dual AeroBlade fans and huge exhaust vents at the back, the laptop dissipates all the inside heat out and allows CPU and GPU to work at its full potential.</p>
<p>The data transfer speeds and superfast app loading speeds are yet another impressive aspects of this laptop. Its 256GB PCIe NVME SSD doesn&#8217;t offer adequate room, but it does help in reducing the bootup times and load times of games and other applications.</p>
<p>Speaking about the benchmarks, we ran a couple of benchmark tests on the laptop to find out its actual potential. Accordingly, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (with i7-8750H and GTX 1060) scored a good P13214 on the 3DMark 11 and a 19800 on multi-core and 4560 on single-core tests via Geekbench 4 64-bit. These scores are on par with most of the other offerings in the segment which makes the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) again king of the mid-range gaming laptops segment.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>All credits to the powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics baked in, the Helios 300 does deliver exceptionally well-performance for the mid-range gaming stationed laptop. We had a good time playing games on it and even at the highest graphics settings, laptop managed to deliver the respectable framerates. However, the fans get quite vocal while gaming and its battery lasted for just 58 minutes in our gaming tests.</p>

<p>The laptop also supports virtual reality, but GTX 1060 isn&#8217;t the best GPU you can get for the VR related tasks. We tested its VR capabilities by playing some VR games, and the laptop managed to run all of them. However, the experience wasn&#8217;t the smoothest and GPU did felt a bit underpowered for VR. But, the GPU is overclockable and overclocking does reduce the lag up to an extent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Like the last year&#8217;s model, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 also comes with the same dual stereo speakers located on the bottom front of the laptop. They are backed by the Acer’s proprietary Acer TruHarmony audio tech and Dolby Audio premium, which claims to enhance the audio quality. However, the audio isn&#8217;t the loudest and its sound gets suppressed due to the bad placement of speakers.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#b3b3b3;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#cdcdcd;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You May Like to Check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life on the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is definitely not the main selling point as it comes with the same 4-cell Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery that we saw in the last year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the laptop can provide up to 7 hours of continuous usage, during our real-time usage, we managed to sustain the battery for close to 4 hours with normal usage. However, while gaming the battery life dropped to a mere 58 minutes which is tad disappointment and less as per the gaming laptop&#8217;s standards of 2018. Moreover, it takes up to two and a half hours to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>So, battery on the new Predator Helios 300 is another thing after design, Acer has used to cut manufacturing costs, and that can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If one is looking for a powerful mid-range gaming laptop, then the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is our top pick right now. It checks a lot of right boxes with its segment first 144Hz display, powerful and latest hardware, and a rather old yet good built chassis. However, a bit heavy form factor, small battery and a 256GB of SSD might be a bit of concern for few. But it&#8217;s hard to find an alternative to this laptop, especially for the price that it comes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Aspire series of laptops are undeniably a complete value for money devices. After spending months on premium laptops, I have got the budget segment Acer Aspire E 15 laptop to review. It is a common tendency to focus on the flaws and deficits the laptop has as the styling, form-factor, features, and specifications of a budget laptop are definitely far behind that of premium devices.</p>
<p>However, to my surprise, the Aspire E 15 stood up really well exceeding my expectations from a laptop priced under $400. Quite frankly, you’ll have a hard time in finding a laptop with impressive specifications, a reliable battery backup, a full HD display, and an abundant amount of RAM <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for less than $400</a>. But, Acer has again hit the sweet spot in the budget segment and their 2018 Acer Aspire E 15 notebook offers all the current generation hardware with the steeped down price tag of just $379!</p>
<p>But, how is the build quality? And, how does it perform in real world? Let’s drill down to the detailed review of Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) laptop and find out if it really is the best budget laptop of 2018.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Usually, when a 15-inch laptop strikes in your mind, there is already a typical image in everyone’s mind and it is the very first and most common impression users get. However, it is not the same case with the Aspire E 15. The laptop although comes with an old-school design pattern, like most of the other 15-inch laptops, it comes with good ergonomics.</p>
<p>Weighing at 5.27 pounds, the laptop is a tab heavy and bulky. However, thanks to its design and engineering, the weight is very uniformly distributed all across the device, making it easy to carry around.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3869 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Design-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15-inch Laptop - Design &amp; Build Quality" width="550" height="480" /></p>
<p>The laptop looks completely identical to the last year&#8217;s model as its design has been carried forward from its predecessor (<a title="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop Review – A Solid Budget-Friendly Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e15-e5-575-33bm-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E5-575-33BM</a>) which is fine because Acer is providing better specs on this year&#8217;s model by cutting down its designing and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>As far as build quality is concerned, the laptop is built from a high quality poly-carbonate plastic and it is finished in black color and has a textured lid which gives it a rather aging yet professional look. The device comes with almost the standard dimensions in terms of length, width, and height and measures 15.02 x 10.2 x 1.19 inches. The laptop feels sturdy but it does have some amount of keyboard and screen flexes which are acceptable considering the price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the port alignment on the device, you get a DVD drive, a charging port, a USB port, and an audio jack aligned with the right edge of the device. On the left edge, you get a couple of USB ports, an HDMI port, and a LAN port, neatly recessed.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD display. The display panel on the laptop is an LED-backlit one, which offers decent resolution for all the essential everyday uses. It sports a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which also makes it one among the very few laptops offering a Full HD resolution in the segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_3870" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-image-3870 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-Laptop-Display-.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H Laptop Review - Display" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>15.6&#8243; Full HD Display &#8211; Best in Segment</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Although the laptop had a decent color accuracy, the brightness was relatively low at only 175 nits. However, the laptop’s display had punchy blacks and decent contrast levels. Watching quality video content on the laptop will be satisfying but the display’s underwhelming brightness might be a bit of concern for some users. However, considering the price point, the display is definitely serviceable.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 comes with latest and top of the line specifications for the asking price. Under the hood, the device sports an 8th generation Intel Core i3-8130U dual-core processor which is the biggest highlight of this year&#8217;s model. The Coffee Lake Intel Core i3 processor is clocked at 2.2 GHz and under full throttle it can turbo boost up to 3.4GHz. The latest processor also comes with an Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics for better overall graphical performance.</p>

<p>The latest processor on the device is paired with a 6GB of RAM which is 2GB more than the last year&#8217;s model, however it is slower DDR3L RAM and this laptop&#8217;s 4+2 RAM configuration also eats up both of its RAM slots. But the good news is, RAM on the laptop can be upgraded up to whopping 32GB. As far as storage on the device is concerned, it is managed by a slow 5400 RPM 1TB hard drive which can also be replaced easily with an SSD.</p>

<p>The laptop also comes with an 8X DVD Double-Layer RW (M-Disc enabled) drive which can read and write from any CD or a DVD.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The Aspire E 15 comes with a backlit keyboard, which is a very rare scene for a laptop priced under $400. The keyboard provides a very comfortable typing experience and comes with a very sturdy and sharp key. The keys provide very good tactile feedback while using and this definitely adds on to the great typing experience. On our typing tests, I hit a rate of 72 words per minute, which is great. One should have absolutely no issues in using this laptop’s keyboard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="750" height="445" /></p>

<p>The touchpad on the device is also very neatly recessed and is very spacious. It does the job adequately well and it comes with both the left and right clickers, like the usual touchpad on a keyboard.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with an abundant number of ports and other connectivity options, which makes the laptop stand out in the segment. It sports 1 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x USB Type-C port, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, an audio jack, and an SD card reader slot.</p>
<div id="attachment_1607" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1607" class="wp-image-1607 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-576-392H Ports &amp; Slots" width="800" height="94" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-300x35.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-768x90.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-610x72.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-600x71.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-50x6.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1607" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Comes with USB Type-C, Ethernet, HDMI, VGA, USB 3.0 ports and DVD RW Drive</strong></em></p></div>
<p>On top of this, the device also comes with a VGA and a DVD writer for the ease of usage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review – Best Value for Money Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-vivobook-f510ua-ah51-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop Review</a> &#8211; The Best Laptop Under $500 of 2018</strong></em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with an HD webcam which sports a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The webcam on the device also supports High Dynamic Range, for better imaging and rendering during a video call or telephony. However, the camera isn’t that great when it comes to capturing some still photographs. The image tends to get a little smoothened and blurred out, losing out on a lot of details in the image. The sensor is, however, fast enough to render the image and adjust it on the screen quickly. Having said that all, the camera on the device serves the cause.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer has always been an exceptionally good multipurpose laptop manufacturer. Accordingly, their Aspire E 15 notebook comes equipped with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two built-in stereo speakers</span> for a surround sound effect. We used the laptop to play heavy music including various genres such as metal, symphony, and mid-focused vocals. The laptop did well and has a powerful sound, which can fill a small room.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the speakers are powered by the company’s proprietary True Harmony sound, which ensures quality audio output with more depth and details. This adds on to the experience while watching movies and playing games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As for watching videos is concerned, the laptop can take it almost any video format at any resolution and play it with ease. We played true 4K content to which the laptop had no struggle playing it whatsoever.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H), being a sub-$400 budget laptop, is still an excellent multimedia performer.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 runs on the latest Windows 10 Operating system, which is confined to the Home variant by default. Apart from housing some of the proprietary applications form the company, the laptop also packs in some additional applications, which we want to term as bloatware.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we personally felt that the laptop comes with slightly more bloatware than that of an ordinary Windows 10 running laptop. Nonetheless, one can easily uninstall the preinstalled apps with ease. The <a title="Acer Laptops Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> come with Acer Recovery management application, which we feel is quite handy, especially if you’re someone who wants to explore more out of your device. Often, people mess up with it and lose their valuable data.</p>
<p>The display of the device comes with two settings, which can be chosen by the user as per their requirements. It comes with a third-party file explorer app known as the ‘App Explorer’, which organizes and sorts the files and folders in the laptop in a slightly better manner. It also comes with CyberLink PowerDVD 14 by default, to run the inbuilt DVD writer.</p>
<p>We faced absolutely no hiccups or hurdles while using the laptop during our review, and the software on the device, never really bothered us despite the bloatware it packs in.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Intel Core i3-8130U processor paired with the 6GB of memory in the Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop provides enough power and speed for productive multitasking on the laptop. During our review, we had multiple multitasking sessions and the laptop did quite well. We even used split screen feature of Windows to play a YouTube video in full HD resolution and running a bunch of benchmarks simultaneously, to which the laptop did quite well, without any lags or stutter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3874" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) 15-inch Laptop Review" width="550" height="530" /></p>
<p>Speaking about our benchmarks, the laptop scored a decent 7,140 on the Geekbench, which gives a pretty much overall performance of the device. This is on par with all the laptops priced under $400. However, the 1TB hard disk drive provided with the laptop had poor read, write and data transfer speeds.</p>
<p>We almost tested out all the connectivity options on the laptop too and it didn’t disappoint us. The device was latching on to the Wi-Fi networks quickly and had a good connectivity range.</p>
<p>As far as the gaming on the device is concerned, considering the price, one should be aware of the fact that, it is not meant for heavy gaming. However, the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics chipset does well for basic gaming. We tested the laptop with some mediocre games such as Dirt 3 racing with graphics set to minimal-medium levels and the laptop did well handling the game and graphics. However, one cannot expect to run heavy games on the device. But what you’re getting in this device at this price range makes it a total steal for the buck.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Our current laptop, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) comes with a 6-cell Li-Ion battery (each 2,800 mAh), which makes it one of the very few devices to come with a 6-cell offering in the segment. Accordingly, the device gives an exceptional battery backup of over 7-8 hours on a continuous usage. Although the company claims that the laptop will give a battery life of over 13 hours, it doesn’t really stand true.</p>
<p>The device takes slightly over 2 hours to charge fully from 0 to 100, which is rather okay for most users. The laptop’s battery life didn’t let us down whatsoever during our usage and this is definitely one of the strong zones of this device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3875" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-best-budget-laptop-of-2018-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 - best budget laptop of 2018 review" width="700" height="320" /></p>
<p>If you’re someone asking us ‘Should I buy this laptop?’, then the answer is ‘YES’ blindfolded. That said, there is undeniably no better competitor for the laptop at this price range, yet. It has powerful innards, offers good performance, lasts long in terms of battery life, and comes with powerful multimedia abilities. What more can you expect from a laptop at this price range?</p>
<p>However, we would have been taken by a storm, if the device had an even brighter display, as that is one of the very few areas, where the laptop falls short.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">ASUS has been one of the global best sellers in laptops division and has been launching various segment of laptops to satisfy various niches. ASUS has recently announced their new gaming series of laptops under TUF (The Ultimate Force), which is derived from the company’s motherboard naming. Considering the major shift of users towards the budget segment laptops, the company has launched the TUF series of gaming laptops, which are mid-rangers, unlike the high-end ROG series of gaming laptops.</p>
<p>TUF motherboards from ASUS are known for their reliability, and stability under extreme conditions. And, same has been brought down in building these new mid-range TUF gaming laptops by the taiwanese giant. On top of this, all these laptops are now powered by the all-new, 8th-generation Intel Core processors.</p>
<p>ASUS has been claiming that the latest TUF series of gaming laptops were designed to last longer than most of the already-available average laptops.</p>
<p>So, after hearing so much about these series of laptops, we decided to put the ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop to the test in our lab, to make our readers familiar with the real-time usage of this mid-range gaming laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX504 comes with an all-plastic body with a red hue to the finishing. The laptop looks stylish and lushes out the gaming pattern from every angle. It comes with the right placement of keyboard, trackpad, ports, and slots, making it one of the most ergonomic laptops in the segment.</p>
<p>Speaking about the dimensions of the device, it measures 15.12 x 10.31 x 0.98 inches in length, breadth, and thickness. The laptop weighs <strong>just over 5 pounds</strong>, making it easy to carry around. Without speaking much about the regular aspects of the device, let’s drill down to what are the special features in the design of this laptop.</p>
<div id="attachment_3776" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3776" class="wp-image-3776 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-Review-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop Review - Design" width="550" height="555" /><p id="caption-attachment-3776" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Metallic Premium Steel Finish on Lid with a Glowing Red ASUS Logo</strong></em></p></div>
<p>ASUS has worked hard and equipped the TUF FX504 with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">advanced anti-dust cooling system</span>. This system is meant to expel the dust particles out of the innards of the laptops through the two available dedicated tunnels, ensuring zero dust residues inside the laptop. Being a gaming laptop, the FX504 has to manage the heating issues and to deal with this, ASUS has integrated the HyperCool technology in the laptop for thermal maintenance. During our test, we couldn&#8217;t tell about the dust as internals were already neat and tidy, but laptop remained cool and calm during our heavy to hardcore usage including gaming.</p>
<p>All in all, the laptop looks absolutely charm and considering the price point, its build quality is also top-notch. Of-course, it isn&#8217;t like a laptop built completely from a single piece of metal, but materials used by ASUS to built their new TUF series of gaming laptops are tough and will ensure the longer life span, no matter in what conditions you use this laptop.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 laptop comes with three different display options with varied refresh rates. Our current contender, the FX504 sports a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Our review unit had a low quality 60Hz TN Panel with 45% in NTSC color gamut. As you would expect, the viewing angles are pathetic and color-reproduction is also very dull. However, it is decent enough for gaming once you set it in the right position and we also liked the matte finishing on the display.</p>
<p>Well, if you want a better display, then Asus does offer TUF FX504 laptop with a full HD 120Hz IPS panel (94% in NTSC color range) but that costs extra and adds up a lot to its original price.</p>
<p>So overall, we think that the display on the laptop could have been a bit better in terms of brightness and viewing angles to suffice the gaming enthusiasts needs.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the internals of the ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop, it is powered by the latest 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. This latest processor can be turbo boosted up to a massive 3.9GHz under full throttle, making it one of the fastest laptops in its segment.</p>
<p>On graphics front, our unit had a less powerful 2GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU but TUF FX504 laptop is also available with GTX 1050 Ti (More on the gaming performance later). Storage on the device is handled by a 1TB of FireCuda storage, bagging the laptop yet another advantage over the other laptops with a normal HDD.  The solid-state hybrid disk (SSHD) on this laptop offers speed, which is twice as fast as a normal hard disk. This helps in faster data transfer speeds, and also helps in loading the applications quickly. The hard drive also ensures less power consumption while maintaining performance and durability.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the laptop is concerned, the laptop has two RAM slots which can accept the RAM up to 32GB and there&#8217;s also a PCIE Gen 3 slot inside for SSD.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800 of 2018</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 comes with a very sturdy keyboard, which the company claims to take up to 20 million key presses. Each key on the keyboard delivers a 1.8mm travel distance, to give a better and more efficient tactile feedback.</p>
<div id="attachment_3779" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-image-3779 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Review.jpg" alt="Keyboard with 1.8mm key travel and spaced function keys" width="643" height="424" /><p id="caption-attachment-3779" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>1.8mm traveling curved keys</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop has been designed with gaming in mind while not compromising on the looks and design. Accordingly, the keyboard on the device also gives the laptop the right gaming hue to satisfy almost all the users. The keyboard is backlit enabled and is curved to the right extent to give a better usage for working in dark.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers with Most Comfortable Keyboard</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Considering the fact that this laptop is a primarily gaming-stationed one, you get a decent list of specifications, which will suffice the gaming needs. The device comes with two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and an HDMI 1.4 port. The device also comes with a microSD card reader.</p>
<div id="attachment_3778" style="width: 541px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3778" class="wp-image-3778 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Laptop-from-Side.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Laptop from Side" width="531" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-3778" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>No ports on right hand side to keep your gaming mouse</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Moreover, all these ports are aligned on the left hand side of the notebook, keeping the right side fully-free for the mouse. That earns ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop 10 out of 10 for the ergonomics.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 runs on the Windows 10 operating system out of the box. Windows 10 is the most efficient and productive operating system to date and is highly optimized to house and run most of the modern games and apps.</p>
<p>Thanks to the windows store, users can get almost all sort of applications such as productive, utilities, entertainment, gaming, and more with ease. The device also comes with some handy features such as multi-window, small-window support to show important notifications and instructions, without interrupting the gaming experience. Considering all these aforementioned features, Windows 10 is an ideal operating system for all the hardcore gamers.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS TUF FX504 is one of the few laptops available in the market right now to come with the latest 8th generation Intel Core i5-8300H quad-core processor right now. Accordingly, the laptop did surprise us with its impeccable speeds and resource handling abilities. Thanks to its 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop&#8217;s multitasking is quite well, and during our usage, we never actually had to shed a sweat using it. That said, the laptop is undeniably an able device for almost all the everyday essentials such as browsing, watching videos, playing audio files, working on documents and more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Best Laptops with Intel Core i5 Processor &#8211; Newest 8th Gen Models</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the connectivity of the device, it comes with super fast Wave 2 WiFi for high speed reliable wireless connectivity. Moreover, the 2&#215;2 MIMO configuration provides up to 30% wider coverage area than the basic 1&#215;1 configuration for uninterrupted gaming even at the less WiFi reception areas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3780" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Gaming-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Gaming Performance" width="550" height="564" /></p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming on the device, the higher clock speed of the processor and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU runs the show. The laptop does exceptionally well in handling almost all of the moderate games. High-end games can also be played on the device, with some restrictions considering this is a mid-range gaming device which has less powerful GPU with just 2GB of DDR5 VRAM.</p>
<p>One thing that we note during our test is the laptop doesn’t heat up even after heavy gaming, thanks to its dual fans with advanced hyper cooling technology. All in all, we had a good time with this laptop in terms of everyday performance as well as gaming.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>As I’ve been saying, the laptop also does pretty well in terms of serving as a multimedia powerhouse. It comes with an immersive 7.1-channel surround sound along with DTS headphone slot. When using the laptop with a headset on, we actually felt the theatre like sound, which helped a lot while playing First-person Shooter games on the laptop. In addition to the powerful speakers, it also comes with a powerful built-in equalizer, which allows adjusting the sound as per the user’s requirements.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; Djing of 2018</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>We also played almost all video formats on the device, and we didn’t have any issue worth mentioning. The built-in microphone on the ASUS TUF FX504 gaming laptop is also worth applauding. We tested it by recording the audio and to our surprise it sounded crystal clear. We also tried using its built-in microphone for commanding the Cortana (Windows assistant) in a room with a lot of noise, and in such conditions as well, it filtered out all the ambient noise and picked up clear voice quite efficaciously.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a lithium-ion battery, which takes about <strong>2.5 hours to fully charge</strong> from 0 to 100. During our review, we were actually surprised to see the battery backup of the device considering the fact that it’s a gaming stationed laptop. Even after heavy usage and multitasking, we still managed to get about 6 hours of continuous usage on a single charge, which is pretty good for a gaming laptop of this calibre.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3782" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ASUS-TUF-FX504-Thin-and-Light-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS TUF FX504 Thin and Light Gaming Laptop Review" width="550" height="569" /></p>
<p>With all our experience with the different laptop models, we can definitely assert that no device is perfect. Every laptop has to undergo a couple trade-offs if not more to meet the requirements. Accordingly, the ASUS TUF FX504 is a very reliable and powerful laptop with decent specifications. However, there are couple of misses, which we could evidently notice. The first being the display, which is a very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">low-quality TN panel</span> and second is its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">less powerful Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU</span> which provides just 2GB of dedicated video memory.</p>
<p>But if we exclude these things, then ASUS is offering a very good package overall with the trust seal of TUF. You get all the latest set of hardware specifications and highly intuitive anti-dust cooling system which not only improves the performance but also enhances the life-span of the laptop.</p>
<p>So, if you want a &#8220;tough&#8221; gaming laptop that can run most AAA titles at medium graphics settings then the ASUS TUF FX504 is the gaming laptop you will love it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP Pavilion series of laptops are globally-renowned for their robustness paired with efficient performance and reliability. After successfully launching a series of all-purpose and business laptops, the company seems to have shifted its focus to the ever-on-demand gaming arena, and have launched the latest mid-range gaming laptop, the HP Pavilion Power 15.</p>
<p>The laptop is launched with huge expectations, as it touted to be one of the best gaming laptops in the budget. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>unique selling point about the laptop is its long-lasting battery</strong></span>, which is a rare scene for a gaming laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop sports all the latest and market-trending set of innards (specifications) and is expected to take down the likes of Dell, MSI, and ASUS in the entry-level to mid-range gaming laptop’s segment. After all the hype and expectations the laptop received, we thought of putting the laptop to test and know whether it can really stand up to the expectations or not. Drill down further to know our thoughts on the HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr gaming laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15 comes with standard design, which although isn’t ground-breaking in terms of looks, but does give a solid look and feel.</p>
<p>The overall build quality and the chassis made is evidently a considerable improvement over the previously launched Pavilion series of notebooks by the company and comes with a toughed rigidity. The laptop’s edges and corners are stronger, sharper, and well-defined with better finish. Thanks to the improvised look and feel, the laptop feels far more aesthetic and versatile.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3678" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop - Design" width="750" height="484" /></p>
<p>The laptop has been designed and engineered considering the everyday usage. The laptop’s lid lifts the rear base of the laptop for the air flow, which maintains the laptop’s temperature. The display can be tilted to a maximum of <em>150 degrees</em>, which will suffice most of the regular users. Keyboard, trackpad, ports, and other connectivity slots are neatly recessed and are properly placed on the laptop. Both the edges consistently house the ports and other connectivity options.</p>
<p>Dimension wise, the laptop measures 9.93 x 14.88 x 0.95 inches, which is pretty much the norm in a 15-inch laptop. The laptop however, weighs just <strong>4 pounds</strong> which makes it ideal for daily commuters like college students and business people. On an overall, comparative note, the laptop’s dimension and weight are not much different than that of the other notebooks in the segment.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr laptop sports a 15.6-inch diagonal Full HD display. The display comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels and the panel on the device is an IPS WLED-backlit enabled one.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3679" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15 Gaming Laptop - Display Review" width="843" height="633" /></p>
<p>The 1080p IPS display works fine on most of the occasions. It does provide good vibrant color reproduction along with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">178-degree of wide-viewing angles</span>. However, we felt the display tended to be a bit grainy, which could take out the fun while playing games or watching videos at higher resolutions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Laptops with Most Color-Accurate Displays for Photo Editing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, the contrast levels on the laptop, were also a bit behind the competition. The color temperature on the laptop is not overly cool nor is very warm, which is a good thing. It has the right balance of color, which will suffice most of the gamers, and regular users. Backlit is subtle and can provide enough thrust for daylight viewing.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Pavilion Power packs in some robust and powerful innards for the asking price. Speaking about the hardware and specifications, the device packs in a latest 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor. The processor of the device comes with a default clock speed of  2.8GHz, which can go up to 3.8GHz in full throttle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops with 8th Gen Intel Core i7 Processors</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For multitasking and handling applications, the laptop comes with a 16GB of DDR4 SDRAM. The latest and the spacious 16GB of RAM ensures smoother and efficient performance at faster speeds. For the storage, the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of Serial ATA hard disk drive. The device also comes with a 128GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 solid-state drive. The read and write speeds of SSD are excellent and hard drive used on the laptop is also faster with 7200RPM speed.</p>
<p>As far as graphics are concerned, the laptop comes with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU with 4GB of DDR5 VRAM. So, from specs sheet the laptop looks pretty good but how&#8217;s the real-life performance? More on that later.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr series comes with an all new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full-size island-style chiclet keyboard</span>. The keyboard is more rigid, and provides better tactile feedback. Although the keys are plastic built, they come with a right concave structure, making typing easy and effective. The keyboard is backlit enabled which comes quite handy.</p>

<p>There are no separate fancy colors for WASD keys though, but that&#8217;s what makes this HP pavilion laptop stand out. Being a professional looking device, this laptop is beast inside and hence, the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best all-purpose laptop in $1000 price range</a> with perfect mixture of work and play.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3680" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-Keyboard-and-Toucpad-review.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="600" height="557" /></p>
<p>The touchpad on the device is also very spacious and comes with a proper surface area to suffice all the gestures and inputs. Moreover, it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chrome-trimmed trackpad</span>, giving it a rich feel while using.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15 comes with an <strong>integrated 720p HD web camera</strong>. The device’s camera can aid in video callings but cannot suffice someone who will use this as a means of capturing images. Although the device can capture images, the results might be a tad disappointing. There is evident visual noise in the images and they appear to be a bit blurry. However, the image gets adjusted quite well to the frame, and the camera’s reception rates are acceptable.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with all the set of ports and input slots, one would expect from a laptop. It comes with a pair of USB 3.1 Gen 1 Ports, an audio jack and kensington lock on left hand side and on right hand side there is one USB Type-C 3.1 Gen 1 port, one USB 3.1 Gen 1 port, RJ-45 port, an HDMI port, and a media card reader.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3681 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="1500" height="570" /></p>
<p>The ports selection on the laptop is very good and you would never run out of ports with this laptop but we think that the ports are aligned slightly close to each other and that might be problematic while connecting thumb drives to adjacent USB ports.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr laptop runs Windows 10 out of the box which is pretty much a norm, when it comes to gaming-stationed laptops. It has a large application market, and an even larger user base, making it an ideal choice for every gaming laptop.</p>
<p>As far as bloatware is concerned, the HP Pavilion Power 15 does come with some softwares pre-installed but some of them are useful. However, they can be uninstalled pretty easily and you can enjoy pure Windows experience with this laptop.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Thanks to the stellar set of specifications, the laptop offers, the performance on this device is not a compromise by any means. That said, the device delivers, powerful performance and can keeps up with all the multitasking demands of the users.</p>
<p>We tested the laptop in its full throttle by throwing multiple heavy applications at it. Thankfully, the laptop handled multiple apps exceptionally well. We were watching 4K content on the laptop, with multiple applications including benchmarks, chrome with almost 15 tabs open, and more, to which the laptop responded really well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Video Editing of 2018 with Powerful Hardware and 4K Screens</a></strong></em></p>
<p>We did not had any issue in using the laptop as the primary work machine. The spacious keyboard and the trackpad helped us stay productive with the works. All the connectivity options provided with the laptop worked like a charm with no hassles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3682 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop Review - Gaming performance" width="700" height="455" /></p>
<p>We ran a couple of benchmarking tests to determine the power and performance of the device. The laptop gave very adequate benchmarking scores, easily topping the lists of most of the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other gaming laptops under $1000</a>.</p>
<p>We also did a couple of other performance tests including the data transfer rate tests, to which the laptop gave amazing results. Thanks to its combination of HDD+SSD, the device was able to achieve very good data transfer rates.</p>
<h4>Gaming Performance</h4>
<p>As far as the gaming on this HP Pavilion is concerned, the integrated <strong>4GB of GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 TI graphics coprocessor</strong> is a show-stealer here.</p>
<p>Being a primarily gaming-stationed laptop, the HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr laptop can handle almost all the modern games with ease even with the graphics set to mid-high level settings. To test its 3D rendering strength, we ran 3D Mark on the device, and the laptop scored a decent <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8800 points</span></strong>.</p>
<p>However, do not expect the buttery smooth gaming experience from demanding games at highest graphics settings. So on a conclusive note, users will be satisfied with the gaming performance of the device, if they keep their expectations in check. We played a couple of modern games including the GTA V on highest graphic mode and the laptop did well.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15’s speakers aren’t very powerful. But, they are subtle enough to give a good audio and listening experience. The device comes with dual Speakers, which are internally tuned by <em><strong>B&amp;O PLAY</strong></em> for better audio output. Moreover, the laptop comes with the company’s proprietary <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HP Audio Boost technology</span> for better audio at various presets.</p>
<p>As far as video experience is concerned, the laptop’s full HD display can handle almost all the content you throw at it. Be it 4K, UHD, Full HD, or HD, we had good time watching video content on the laptop. But, as we mentioned earlier the display is bit grainy and it isn&#8217;t the brightest to use easily in the daylight conditions.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The company claimed that the laptop can provide a battery backup of up to 11 hours on a single charge, which is very huge for any gaming laptop. However, when we put the laptop to test, it provided us an endurance period of about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7-8 hours on a single charge</span></strong>, which is still pretty commendable for a gaming laptop. The device is powered by a lithium-ion polymer battery, which <em>takes just 1 hour for a full charge from 0 to 100</em> which is again an added advantage of this laptop. So, battery life is where this laptop shines and stands out in the segment and we would like to applaud HP for that.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr is unarguably one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best value-for-money gaming laptop in sub-$1000 segment</strong></span>. The laptop has got able hardware paired with decent specs. Although the laptop lags slightly behind the competition in terms of display quality and audio output, its performance, built, and battery life makes it a very worthy buy.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>MSI is not just known for their powerful innards and gaming performance, the devices are globally-reputed for their beautifully crafted aesthetics and design which compliments gamers.</p>
<p>Speaking of our current device, the MSI GL62M 7REX uses the same case and design as most of its predecessors. The only difference being, the laptop is considerably slimmer and light weighed when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<div id="attachment_3376" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-image-3376 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Slim-and-Lightweight-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Slim and Lightweight Gaming Laptop" width="650" height="242" /><p id="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin and Light for Gaming on-the-go</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, the lightweight and portability are achieved on the cost of an optical drive, which the device lacks. The body of the device comes with a matte-finished plastic chassis with a bright red accent on the rear, which goes all the way to the dual fan grilles. The device comes with the dimension 15.1 x 10.2 x 1.1 inches which is pretty much the norm for 15.6-inched laptops.</p>
<p>On an overall note, the design of the device is pretty stylish, compact, slim, and easy to carry. Moreover, the device gives you that perfect mean-for-gaming hue by all the means. With this laptop, the company seems to aim at achieving portability by attaining the slim chassis and at a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thickness of 1.06 inches with weight just over 5.29 pounds</span>, the MSI GL62M 7REX gaming laptop is extremely portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M comes with a 15.6&#8243; Full HD eDP matte-finished display. The display on the devices holds a resolution of 1920-by-1080 pixels which is powered by In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology. It is due to this, the display provides wide-viewing angles.</p>
<div id="attachment_3377" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3377" class="wp-image-3377 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-Gaming-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX Gaming Laptop - Display Review" width="700" height="457" /><p id="caption-attachment-3377" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Color Accurate and Easy on Eyes</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The device comes with <strong>94% NTSC color range</strong>, which means, the device is capable of delivering very competent color reproduction which makes this laptop also an <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent choice for photo editing</a>. Of course, this better color gamut complements the gaming on MSI GL62M 7REX, which we personally experienced and liked. The blacks are punchy and the panel is bright enough even for outdoor usage. We did not feel any fatigue even after using the laptop for prolonged durations, which is an excellent thing to consider for the gaming laptops.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>MSI GL62M comes with a very powerful and able set of specifications and hardware, which bolsters its brand reputation. MSI, being one of the world-renowned gaming laptop manufacturers delivers powerful machines with futuristic tech to meet the audience&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3379" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-15.6-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Hardware-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop - Hardware Review" width="550" height="351" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by an Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, which can be clocked at 2.8-3.8 GHz depending on the load on the processor. For multitasking and handling applications, the device comes with an 8GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 2400MHz. The RAM is further <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expandable up to 32GB</span> with the unused slot provided. For the graphics segment, the MSI GL62M 7REX comes with a 4GB of <strong>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti</strong> graphics processor, which runs the show on the laptop. All the games and other graphics-heavy applications are handled by the GPU with ease.</p>

<p>Storage front on the laptop is also its add-on as it comes with a combination of both SSD and HDD. The device comes with a <em><strong>128GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD</strong></em> to store huge files and all other user data.</p>

<p>Along with these regular set of specifications, the laptop also comes with gaming-specific hardware such as very thin and lightweight chassis, and the company&#8217;s proprietary cooler boost technology, to limit the heating in the laptop even when subjected to heavy usage.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The built-in 720p HD webcam can cover the maximum resolution of 1280&#215;720 pixels. The laptop&#8217;s webcam can although meet the basic requirements of video calling but provides pixelated images, when clicked. Thankfully, the device adjusts the picture on frame quickly and has a decent frame rate, when it comes to the videos being captured or streamed for a video call through the webcam.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, the MSI GL62M 7REX is expected to house, enough number of ports, which will accommodate all its gaming essentials and peripherals such as joysticks, and other gaming consoles. Standing up to the same expectations, the MSI GL62M comes with a long list of ports, which will suffice almost everyone&#8217;s gaming and other needs. The device comes with a pair of USB 3.0 ports for faster, and efficient file transfers and peripheral connectivity.</p>
<div id="attachment_3381" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3381" class="wp-image-3381 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M - Ports and Slots" width="800" height="464" /><p id="caption-attachment-3381" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>MSI GL62M offer tons of connectivity options minus CD/DVD drive</strong></em></p></div>

The MSI GL62M 7REX comes with a Steel series red backlit keyboard and anti-ghost keys. The keyboard comes with a silver lining making it not just handy to use during low lights but also makes it stand out of the segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_3383" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3383" class="wp-image-3383 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX Gaming Laptop - Keyboard Review" width="800" height="515" /><p id="caption-attachment-3383" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Steelseries Gaming Keyboard with 1.9mm key travel and Anti-Ghosting WASD zone for uninterrupted gaming</strong></em></p></div>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the gaming performance of the laptop, let&#8217;s first speak about its everyday-performance. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop can pretty much handle everything you throw at it. However, RAM at times might be a hinder for heavy applications. On the other hand, the graphics processing abilities of this laptop are simply impeccable and here is what we felt after an extensive usage of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3387" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Gaming-Laptop-Performance-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Gaming Laptop - Performance Review" width="650" height="469" /></p>
<p>During our usage, we didn&#8217;t feel or notice any considerable heating issues neither did we face any connectivity issues. The laptop was able to handle heavy applications such as Photoshop, Maya, and more. We also put the laptop to extensive multitasking which was also very well handled by the laptop.</p>

<p>For any gaming laptop, the GPU is probably the most crucial aspect. Accordingly, our current contender packs in a latest <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of GDDR5 memory</span></strong>. This series of graphics cards from NVIDIA is the top-of-the-line pascal architecture graphic processors. Although being the latest in the iteration, the graphics card isn&#8217;t the best of the gaming processors out there. Keeping in mind that the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop falls under $1000 price bracket</a>, MSI GL62M 7REX will satisfy most of the professional gamers.</p>
<p>This mid-range gaming laptop is powerful enough to handle almost any high-end game you throw at it. However, you might have to at times, set the graphics quality to mid-range for the better experience. We ran a couple of benchmarks on the device and all the numbers satisfied us. We ran 3D Mark on this device, to which the laptop responded well and scored over 9300 points. We also ran a bunch of top games to provide our readers with the real-time usage scenarios. In its ultra-mode, which is especially meant for power gaming, the device managed to achieve commendable frame rates in various games, which are as follows:</p>
<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_progress_bar wpb_content_element  vc_progress-bar-color-bar_grey"><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Overwatch <span class="vc_label_units">75 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="75" data-value="75"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">COD - Infinity Warfare <span class="vc_label_units">59 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="59" data-value="59"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">DOOM <span class="vc_label_units">68 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="68" data-value="68"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Gears of War 4 <span class="vc_label_units">61 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="61" data-value="61"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Battlefield <span class="vc_label_units">60 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="60" data-value="60"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>On a conclusive note, the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US ticks all the boxes right and does well in the segments in which it is primarily meant to serve in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 &#8211; Top 10 High-Performance Laptops</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M&#8217;s audio is pumped by the company&#8217;s proprietary <strong>Nahimic 2 technology</strong>. This is an Audio Enhancement tech, which provides powerful audio without compromising on the details. During our review, the audio from the laptop generating was great. Especially, the depths of audio, while playing games made us feel the gaming environment around us. With this laptop, the users can get the most of 3D sound enhancement of the virtual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.1 surround sound</span> while reducing external noise.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, thanks to its bright display and graphics abilities, the laptop can play all formats of video content with ease.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is vital. However, in the case of gaming laptops, battery life cannot be expected to provide any wonders. That said, the MSI GL62M lasted for about 4 hours on our rundown tests, which included continuous heavy usage and multitasking. Although this is pretty much what we get of a gaming laptop, we certainly expected that the battery would last longer at least by an hour. The addition of heat pipes and dual cooling systems might be the reason for the high battery usage.</p>
<p>The laptop takes about two and half hours for it to get completely charged form 0 to 100. Again, if we&#8217;re speaking about this in a gaming laptop&#8217;s perspective, then the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US gaming laptop will satisfy most, if not all.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3344" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/msi-gl62m-7rex-1896us-156-full-hd-gaming-laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6&quot; Full HD Gaming Laptop" width="500" height="290" /></p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the laptop at this price is definitely a very decent buy. However, if you&#8217;re not a complete gamer, then we&#8217;d recommend you to switch to another other device in the price range to get a better RAM, and battery backup. All the gamers, need to keep in mind that this device is a mid-range gaming laptop to keep their expectations in check. That said, the laptop still has a lot of amazing specs and features such as a bright display, powerful audio, very sturdy performance, and amazing look and aesthetics.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA is a revamped version of the previous VivoBook edition of laptops launched by the company. This time ASUS has been in trend and made its laptops much more elegant, sleek, and stylish. The laptops are also lighter and are marginally thinner than its predecessors and weigh just about 3.7 pounds and come with measurements of 14.2 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches.</p>
<div id="attachment_3097" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-image-3097 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop - Design" width="650" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thinner &amp; Lighter (Just 0.8-inch thick and weighs 3.7 pounds)</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a brushed metal, shiny chassis, in a glittering grey color. The laptop is thicker at the hinge-edge and gradually gets narrower. The design aspects of the VivoBook, we feel, are largely drawn from the likes of the <a title="Check Current Price of MacBook Air on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2hKvugK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple’s MacBook Air</a> externally. The placement of ports, trackpad, keyboard, and other vitals are very similar to the previous generation of VivoBooks, and all in all, the laptop feels quite easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3098 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop Review" width="650" height="386" /></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of this laptop is that it comes with an ultra-narrow 0.3-inch ASUS’ proprietary NanoEdge bezel, which gives an amazing 80% of screen-to-body ratio. The bezels on the laptop are fairly negligible and are probably one of the rarest laptops in the market currently to offer such slim bezel display in a laptop at such low price.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, ASUS VivoBook F510UA makes it feels like you have a full-size 15.6” FHD WideView display embedded into a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a>, which not only makes it compact and sleek to use, but also offers wider, bigger, and much better display. On a final note on the design and build quality, the laptop comes with a uniform solid build quality and certainly is beautiful enough to attract the masses.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LED display which is vibrant. As far as the resolution of the display is concerned, it comes with a Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. As mentioned earlier, the laptop’s WideView makes it look even better, and thanks to its larger display, the viewing angles on this machine are perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_3099" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-image-3099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop - Display Review" width="800" height="445" /><p id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also comes with the ASUS’ proprietary Splendid visual optimization technology, which automatically provides the optimized visuals to the user for almost any kind of content being played. The laptop comes with custom features as well as pre-installed display modes such as Normal, Vivid, Eye-Care, and Manual, which can be accessed and enabled based on the user’s choice. The videos on the screen also turn out to be a visual treat all thanks to the ASUS Tru2Life Video technology which enhances the movie watching experience on this laptop. The display on this device comes with an intelligent set of sensors which optimises the essential visual parameters such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and hue in every pixel to produce vivid and lively imagery.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA laptop offers a robust set of innards and is undeniably a powerful device on the paper. Let’s have a quick glance at what does the laptop offers. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the latest and the most advanced, 8th Generation of Intel Core i5-8250U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 1.6GHz which can, however, rattle up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Laptops with Intel Core i5 8th Gen Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Multitasking and the applications on the device are handled by an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage department on the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of HDD, which is although ample amount of storage, still lags behind SSD when it comes to data transfer speeds and efficiency. We hoped that the laptop comes with an SSD storage, this could have been a deadly combination for a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $500</a>. The laptop comes with an integrated graphics coprocessor and doesn’t come with any additional GPU.</p>
<p>VivoBook also comes with a fingerprint sensor to add a layer of security to the device and the data in it. This is certainly one of the rare finds in a laptop priced at this range.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the hardware is concerned, the laptop&#8217;s RAM can be upgraded up to 16GB, and its hard drive is also swappable with solid state drive. So, overall ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is a future-proof device which not only provides all current generation hardware specifications but also ensures that it stays up to date with time.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The VivoBook comes with a VGA front-facing camera, and like most of the other laptops in the segment, the front camera on the device is just serviceable. It can capture decent images in daylight conditions and fails to add details under low-light. The image rendering of the device’s camera is quick and is able enough to capture fleeting moments during a video call. There’s nothing exceptional about the webcam on this laptop, and at the same time, do note that there’s nothing to complain as well.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the ports and connectivity options on the VivoBook, it comes with a standard set of ports, which is more or less a common practice in most of the laptops. All the ports are uniformly distributed along the two sides of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Ports and Slots" width="800" height="370" /></p>
<p>The device comes with one USB 3.1 and one USB 3.0 port, for faster, reliable, and efficient data transfers. And, comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports for adding up additional peripherals. It also houses an HDMI, 3.5mm Audio Jack, and an SD card reader.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop comes with Windows 10 Home variant pre-installed. Windows 10, which is world&#8217;s most used computer operating system, needs no introduction of what it’s capable of. The laptop doesn’t come with any much of the bloatware and is, therefore, fast, efficient, and nag-free. The device, however, does come pre-installed with some of the productive aspects and tools, which ought to increase the overall productivity of the system.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to its powerful and most importantly, the latest set of hardware and innards, the VivoBook offers excellent performance for the budget. No matter how strong the specifications are on paper, what actually matters is its real-time usage and performance. And during our usage and hands-on with this sleek and stylish looking laptop, we were satisfied with its overall performance.</p>
<p>The laptop stays quiet and offers decent graphic-based tasks performance. That said, as the laptop doesn’t come with a specific dedicated graphics coprocessor, the gaming on the device might not cater hardcore gamers. However, thankfully, it can handle small to mediocre demanding games quite well, thanks to the Intel&#8217;s integrated UHD 620 graphics.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Multimedia stands as a common stop for all sorts of laptop users. Be it gamers, businessmen, students, regular home purpose, no matter what the need is, a laptop will undeniably be used as a source of multimedia.</p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA comes with Two Built-in Stereo Speakers which provides very powerful and thumping audio output. During our review, we tested the speakers with bass heavy, punchy tracks, accustomed mids, and also treble stationed lean tracks. And to our surprise, the sound was pretty clear on all the occasions.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, it can handle almost all forms of videos and codecs. 4K and Full HD videos were playing absolutely lag-free and thanks to its wide viewing angles, we actually had a good time watching content on this laptop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Battery Life</span></p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA was one among the very first laptop we tested, which came along with the 8th Gen Intel core processors and we must say, the chipsets are very power efficient and robust. The laptop offers decent battery backup and is probably way ahead of most of its rivals in the segment.</p>
<p>On a single charge, the laptop stays juiced up for about 5-6 hours of continuous usage. It takes just over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. The battery type on this laptop is a Li-Ion one, and our final comments on the battery life would be <em>&#8216;The laptop did not fail us in terms of battery life,&#8217;</em> while most others in this price range don&#8217;t provide this good specs and battery life for the price!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2960 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Not every laptop in the market comes with the latest 8th Gen Intel core processors and decent battery life. Even if they do, they will certainly not look as polished and solid as the ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop. Moreover, the price point of $500 makes this laptop an unarguably one of the better offerings you can get currently in the market. Provided, you are not looking for a gaming-stationed laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 comes with a matte finish all plastic body, which gives the old school look of a common laptop. On the very first view, there was nothing groundbreaking about the laptop, as far its design and looks are concerned. The laptop although looks a little thick and hefty, it is actually, a very ergonomically built work machine. The laptop comes with the right placement of ports and connectivity slots, and all in all feels way better than its other competitors in the market.</p>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15 x 10.1 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weighs close to 5.2 pounds, which we felt was a little heavy for a laptop this calibre. However, it wasn&#8217;t that heavy to be considered as a drawback.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2685" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-Series-P2540UA-AB51-Business-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="650" height="627"></p>
<p>Space on both the edges of the laptop are well managed and are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The keyboard and the trackpad placement on the device are ideal for most cases and feels of superior quality.</p>

<p>All in all, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop comes with a balanced and finely engineered design and feels sturdy to grip and carry around.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/2tx8oJY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop</a> features a 15.6-inch anti-glare Full HD display with a standard resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The laptop’s display comes with a matte finish on top of its anti-glare enabled display, which prevents unwanted reflections and helps reduce eye fatigue. The laptop does provide a very bright display and also had great viewing angles.</p>

<p>Thanks to its very bright and anti-reflective display, the laptop as expected scored a very good, 148 percent in RGB color ratio with the brightness measured around 210 nits, which is again way beyond the other laptops at this price range. The screen had detailed detailing and was able to show blacks and whites with accuracy.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Diving into the hardware and specifications department of the laptop, the device comes with a long list of interesting yet powerful specifications for the asking price. Speaking about the innards of this laptop, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is powered by a latest <strong>seventh gen Intel Core i5 processor</strong> paired with a good 8GB of RAM.&nbsp;The dual-core i5 processor is clocked at 2.5GHz, which can go up to 3.1GHz in its full throttle. The efficiency of the processor and RAM makes sure that multiple applications run on the laptop with ease.</p>

<p>Whereas, graphics on the laptop are handled well by the integrated Intel HD 620 graphics. This isn&#8217;t an ideal choice for gaming but this laptop will definitely quench your occasional gaming cravings. As far as storage on the laptop is concerned, it is backed by a 1TB of mechanical HDD with a speed of 5400RPM. The hardware specifications on this laptop are unlike any other laptops in the segment. That said, this is the only <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop in $500 price range</a> which comes with Intel i5 processor.

<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2694" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P2540UA-AB51-15.6-Inch-Business-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS P2540UA-AB51 Laptop - Ports &amp; Slots" width="900" height="377"></p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>ASUS P2540UA-AB51 has a 720p camera, which adequately does the work of capturing images and video calls. The laptop’s webcam provides a grainy output when snapping images, but on an overall note, the webcam on this laptop is quite serviceable.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The ASUS P-Series P2540-AB51 laptop comes with Windows 10 Home (64 bit) operating system pre-installed. This is probably the best part of this laptop; The operating system. Windows 10 Home variant has been customised by various laptop vendors and has been baking with unnecessary bloatware. However, on ASUS P2540UA-AB51, the OS doesn&#8217;t have any bloatware and is absolutely the pure Windows OS.</p>
<p>Sounds unbelievable, Right? Well, we also thought the same until we tested this laptop and found that it has not a single app or software pre-installed when it booted for first time.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Considering the price tag, the laptop offers top-notch performance. Thanks to its latest set of specifications and hardware packed beneath the hood the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 delivers a very efficient and stable performance even under prolonged sessions of continuous usage. Since the laptop is powered by the latest seventh generation of Intel Core i5 processor, it doesn&#8217;t heat up even after a rugged usage. The laptop stays cool and stays calm, delivering the optimum performance expected.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2695" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-series-P2540UA-Business-Laptop-Overall-Performance.jpg" alt="ASUS P-series P2540UA Business Laptop - Overall Performance Review" width="650" height="626"></p>
<p>We used the laptop rigorously to run our benchmarking apps and also streamed Full HD and 4K content for hours together. We also had a continuous browsing session with around 8-10 tabs alive concurrently in Chrome. Surprisingly, the laptop managed to multitask with ease, without any hassle. Thus, delivering an uninterrupted performance.</p>
<p>Speaking about the connectivity, we faced no issues to latch onto WiFi networks and the laptop provided good and constant connectivity without any bandwidth merging related issues. All that said, the laptop is an excellent multi-tasking device and can deliver a very reliable performance for all type of usages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="fasc-button fasc-size-xlarge fasc-type-flat ico-fa fasc-ico-before fa-tags" style="background-color: #e33333; color: #ffffff;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://amzn.to/2tx8oJY">$499.00 | Buy Now From Amazon</a></p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As the laptop is bolstered by an integrated Intel HD graphics, the gaming on this laptop is strictly mediocre. With its Intel HD 620 Graphics, the laptop delivers just average graphics rendering. Thankfully, the laptop can still run games, provided they aren&#8217;t graphic heavy. This laptop is not meant for gaming, and therefore, gaming is your primary requirement then this laptop is not for you. However, you can still play low-to-medium graphics enabled games on this laptop with ease.</p>
<p>The titles we ran on this laptop and managed to run smoothly after scaling down the graphics are &#8211; Minecraft (45 fps), Counter Strike &#8211; Global Offensive (40 fps).</p>
<p><em><strong>Check Out &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 7 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500 of 2017</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is although a business entered all-purpose laptop, it still has the potential to satisfy multimedia stationed users. That said, the laptop can play 4K content with ease and thanks to its bright antiglare display, watching content on this laptop is a delight.</p>
<p>But wait! there’s a catch, the laptop although have a good set of specifications, its speakers aren&#8217;t the best and they tend to get muffled up at higher volumes. The volume levels are also strictly mediocre. Therefore, we’d suggest the users to either go with an additional set of the audio system to aid the laptop.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Here comes the most essential and crucial zone of the laptop, the battery backup. Finding laptops with long-lasting batteries is no less than a herculean task these days. We cannot simply trust the numbers written by laptop manufacturers which are although intended to create the hype.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our current contender, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51, does exceptionally well in this segment.</p>
<p>The laptop provided up slightly over 8 hours of battery backup on a single charge with normal use, which is rather phenomenal in a laptop that is priced below $500! Again that depends upon one&#8217;s usages. While gaming we noticed that the battery backup was dropped to mere 3 hours and we had to plugin the charger which took about 3 hours to completely charge its lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note &#8211; The charging time can be reduced by keeping the laptop in the sleep mode or by shutting down the Windows.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2696" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P2540UA-AB51-15.6-Inch-Laptop-Battery-Life.jpg" alt="ASUS P2540UA-AB51 15.6 Inch Laptop - Battery Life" width="650" height="653"></p>
