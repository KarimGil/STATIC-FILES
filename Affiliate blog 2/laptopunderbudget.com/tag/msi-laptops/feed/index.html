										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MSI are the latest in the long line of gaming laptop manufacturers to unveil their newest and latest RTX gaming laptops at CES 2019.</p>
<p>For 2019, MSI will usher in three new RTX gaming laptops into the market: the GS75 Stealth laptop, the PS63 Modern laptop, and the GE75 Raider laptop.</p>
<p>Each gaming laptop in their latest lineup is aimed towards catering to a specific target audience, but all three are made to help reaffirm MSI&#8217;s &#8220;position as an industry leader endorsed by gamers and eSports teams worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside their RTX gaming laptops, MSI also used CES 2019 to announce several of their latest products as well. This includes a new pre-built desktop, a new desktop case, a new gaming keyboard, and their newest line of high-performance graphics cards, spearheaded by the MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GAMING X TRIO.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to MSI&#8217;s RTX Gaming Laptops</h3>
<p>Leading the charge for MSI&#8217;s newest RTX gaming laptops is the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop. Coming in at just 0.75 inches thick and sporting a thin bezel design, all housed in an aluminum alloy body for a premium look, the GS75 is meant to stand out aesthetically. Specs-wise, the GS75 doesn&#8217;t lag behind its competition either. It comes with a huge 17.3-inch 144Hz IPS-level display, the latest Intel Core i7 series CPUs, and perhaps more importantly, the NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU.</p>
<div id="attachment_5094" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-image-5094 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MSI-GS75-Stealth-17-inch-Thin-and-Light-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GS75 Stealth 17 inch Thin and Light Gaming Laptop" width="578" height="408" /><p id="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>MSI GS75 Stealth</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The GS75&#8217;s smaller brother, the GS65, is also receiving an update for the new year as well. The newest version of the 15.6-inch gaming laptop that weighs just 4.19 pounds will include the best and latest CPUs and GPUs the market has to offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 &#8211; Our Top Picks</a></strong></p>
<p>Next up is the PS63 Modern. A laptop built for another market entirely, it is not the same beast of a gaming laptop that the GS75 is. At just 0.63 inches thick and 3.53 pounds, the PS63 Modern is perfect for content creators who are looking for a lightweight laptop that can doesn&#8217;t lag behind in terms of performance. It comes equipped with up to an Intel Core i7 processor and up to an NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU. More importantly, it has a 16-hour battery life and MSI&#8217;s own proprietary software called the &#8220;Creator Center&#8221; aimed specifically towards people who use creator software frequently.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not the least, is the GE75 Raider gaming laptop. Much like the GS75, it comes equipped with the latest NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. However, different from the GS75, the GE75 will feature a thicker, more gamerish aesthetic, complete with a reflective diamond cut trim and a red anodized finish for a more aggressive look.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, MSI didn&#8217;t unveil any details regarding when the general public will have a chance to get their hands on their latest RTX gaming laptops. However, many expect the Taiwan-based company to release more information regarding about the pricing and the availability of their RTX gaming laptops pretty soon.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>MSI is not just known for their powerful innards and gaming performance, the devices are globally-reputed for their beautifully crafted aesthetics and design which compliments gamers.</p>
<p>Speaking of our current device, the MSI GL62M 7REX uses the same case and design as most of its predecessors. The only difference being, the laptop is considerably slimmer and light weighed when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<div id="attachment_3376" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-image-3376 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Slim-and-Lightweight-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Slim and Lightweight Gaming Laptop" width="650" height="242" /><p id="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin and Light for Gaming on-the-go</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, the lightweight and portability are achieved on the cost of an optical drive, which the device lacks. The body of the device comes with a matte-finished plastic chassis with a bright red accent on the rear, which goes all the way to the dual fan grilles. The device comes with the dimension 15.1 x 10.2 x 1.1 inches which is pretty much the norm for 15.6-inched laptops.</p>
<p>On an overall note, the design of the device is pretty stylish, compact, slim, and easy to carry. Moreover, the device gives you that perfect mean-for-gaming hue by all the means. With this laptop, the company seems to aim at achieving portability by attaining the slim chassis and at a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thickness of 1.06 inches with weight just over 5.29 pounds</span>, the MSI GL62M 7REX gaming laptop is extremely portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M comes with a 15.6&#8243; Full HD eDP matte-finished display. The display on the devices holds a resolution of 1920-by-1080 pixels which is powered by In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology. It is due to this, the display provides wide-viewing angles.</p>
<div id="attachment_3377" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3377" class="wp-image-3377 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-Gaming-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX Gaming Laptop - Display Review" width="700" height="457" /><p id="caption-attachment-3377" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Color Accurate and Easy on Eyes</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The device comes with <strong>94% NTSC color range</strong>, which means, the device is capable of delivering very competent color reproduction which makes this laptop also an <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent choice for photo editing</a>. Of course, this better color gamut complements the gaming on MSI GL62M 7REX, which we personally experienced and liked. The blacks are punchy and the panel is bright enough even for outdoor usage. We did not feel any fatigue even after using the laptop for prolonged durations, which is an excellent thing to consider for the gaming laptops.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>MSI GL62M comes with a very powerful and able set of specifications and hardware, which bolsters its brand reputation. MSI, being one of the world-renowned gaming laptop manufacturers delivers powerful machines with futuristic tech to meet the audience&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3379" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-15.6-Inch-Gaming-Laptop-Hardware-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop - Hardware Review" width="550" height="351" /></p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by an Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, which can be clocked at 2.8-3.8 GHz depending on the load on the processor. For multitasking and handling applications, the device comes with an 8GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 2400MHz. The RAM is further <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expandable up to 32GB</span> with the unused slot provided. For the graphics segment, the MSI GL62M 7REX comes with a 4GB of <strong>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti</strong> graphics processor, which runs the show on the laptop. All the games and other graphics-heavy applications are handled by the GPU with ease.</p>

<p>Storage front on the laptop is also its add-on as it comes with a combination of both SSD and HDD. The device comes with a <em><strong>128GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD</strong></em> to store huge files and all other user data.</p>
<div id="attachment_3380" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3380" class="wp-image-3380 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-Gaming-Laptop-Vents-for-Cooling.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX Gaming Laptop - Vents for Efficient Cooling" width="700" height="201" /><p id="caption-attachment-3380" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Huge Air Vents for Efficient Cooling</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Along with these regular set of specifications, the laptop also comes with gaming-specific hardware such as very thin and lightweight chassis, and the company&#8217;s proprietary cooler boost technology, to limit the heating in the laptop even when subjected to heavy usage.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The built-in 720p HD webcam can cover the maximum resolution of 1280&#215;720 pixels. The laptop&#8217;s webcam can although meet the basic requirements of video calling but provides pixelated images, when clicked. Thankfully, the device adjusts the picture on frame quickly and has a decent frame rate, when it comes to the videos being captured or streamed for a video call through the webcam.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, the MSI GL62M 7REX is expected to house, enough number of ports, which will accommodate all its gaming essentials and peripherals such as joysticks, and other gaming consoles.

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the gaming performance of the laptop, let&#8217;s first speak about its everyday-performance. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop can pretty much handle everything you throw at it. However, RAM at times might be a hinder for heavy applications.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3387" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Gaming-Laptop-Performance-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Gaming Laptop - Performance Review" width="650" height="469" /></p>
<p>During our usage, we didn&#8217;t feel or notice any considerable heating issues neither did we face any connectivity issues. The laptop was able to handle heavy applications such as Photoshop, Maya, and more. We also put the laptop to extensive multitasking which was also very well handled by the laptop.</p>

<p>For any gaming laptop, the GPU is probably the most crucial aspect. Accordingly, our current contender packs in a latest <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of GDDR5 memory</span></strong>. This series of graphics cards from NVIDIA is the top-of-the-line pascal architecture graphic processors. Although being the latest in the iteration, the graphics card isn&#8217;t the best of the gaming processors out there. Keeping in mind that the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop falls under $1000 price bracket</a>, MSI GL62M 7REX will satisfy most of the professional gamers.</p>
<p>This mid-range gaming laptop is powerful enough to handle almost any high-end game you throw at it. However, you might have to at times, set the graphics quality to mid-range for the better experience. We ran a couple of benchmarks on the device and all the numbers satisfied us. We ran 3D Mark on this device, to which the laptop responded well and scored over 9300 points. We also ran a bunch of top games to provide our readers with the real-time usage scenarios. In its ultra-mode, which is especially meant for power gaming, the device managed to achieve commendable frame rates in various games, which are as follows:</p>
<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_progress_bar wpb_content_element  vc_progress-bar-color-bar_grey"><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Overwatch <span class="vc_label_units">75 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="75" data-value="75"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">COD - Infinity Warfare <span class="vc_label_units">59 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="59" data-value="59"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">DOOM <span class="vc_label_units">68 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="68" data-value="68"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Gears of War 4 <span class="vc_label_units">61 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="61" data-value="61"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Battlefield <span class="vc_label_units">60 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="60" data-value="60"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>On a conclusive note, the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US ticks all the boxes right and does well in the segments in which it is primarily meant to serve in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 &#8211; Top 10 High-Performance Laptops</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M&#8217;s audio is pumped by the company&#8217;s proprietary <strong>Nahimic 2 technology</strong>. This is an Audio Enhancement tech, which provides powerful audio without compromising on the details. During our review, the audio from the laptop generating was great. Especially, the depths of audio, while playing games made us feel the gaming environment around us. With this laptop, the users can get the most of 3D sound enhancement of the virtual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.1 surround sound</span> while reducing external noise.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, thanks to its bright display and graphics abilities, the laptop can play all formats of video content with ease.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is vital. However, in the case of gaming laptops, battery life cannot be expected to provide any wonders. That said, the MSI GL62M lasted for about 4 hours on our rundown tests, which included continuous heavy usage and multitasking. Although this is pretty much what we get of a gaming laptop, we certainly expected that the battery would last longer at least by an hour. The addition of heat pipes and dual cooling systems might be the reason for the high battery usage.</p>
<p>The laptop takes about two and half hours for it to get completely charged form 0 to 100. Again, if we&#8217;re speaking about this in a gaming laptop&#8217;s perspective, then the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US gaming laptop will satisfy most, if not all.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3344" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/msi-gl62m-7rex-1896us-156-full-hd-gaming-laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6&quot; Full HD Gaming Laptop" width="500" height="290" /></p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the laptop at this price is definitely a very decent buy. However, if you&#8217;re not a complete gamer, then we&#8217;d recommend you to switch to another other device in the price range to get a better RAM, and battery backup. All the gamers, need to keep in mind that this device is a mid-range gaming laptop to keep their expectations in check. That said, the laptop still has a lot of amazing specs and features such as a bright display, powerful audio, very sturdy performance, and amazing look and aesthetics.</p>
