<h3>1. Microsoft Surface Pro 7 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best Overall</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2vUcDqg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4213 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-6-Matt-Black-Preorders.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 6 - best laptops for graphic design 2019" width="650" height="428"></a></p>
<p>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is one of the most versatile and best-selling 2-in-1 laptops in the global market. The laptop is not just powerful from its innards but is equally well-built for varied uses. It can be paired with a detachable keyboard, which makes it comfortable to use it as a tablet as well as a laptop. For drawing, the laptop is compatible with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Surface Pen (4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity)</strong></span>, which is one of the best digital pens on any gadget to date. The Surface Pro 7 is compact and comes with excellent ergonomics for ease of usage. However, both the Surface Pen and the Type Cover costs extra which adds about another $200 to its price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the specifications, the Surface Pro 7 is powered by an Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. The device can also be bought with Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD which makes it stand out in the segment of powerful convertibles.

<h4>Microsoft Surface Laptop 3</h4>
<div id="attachment_4703" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://amzn.to/39HFQDr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4703" class="wp-image-4703" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Surface-Laptop-2.jpg" alt="Surface Laptop 3" width="400" height="244"></a><p id="caption-attachment-4703" class="wp-caption-text">Microsoft Surface Laptop 3</p></div>
<p>The Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 is yet another variant from the Surface series of laptops from Microsoft which we recommend to artists. Although the device, doesn’t come with a detachable screen like other Surface devices, it still has the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Microsoft’s proprietary PixelSense 13.5&#8243; touchscreen technology</span>. And,&nbsp;thanks to its <strong>color-accurate display and the support of Surface Pen</strong>, this laptop can be used for drawing and other graphic artworks.</p>
<p>However, we won&#8217;t recommend Surface Laptop 3 to someone who is looking for a proper drawing laptop. It can be a great secondary machine for artists for everyday productivity and random drawing and editing work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all-new Acer ConceptD laptops are what happens when Acer takes all of their expertise in creating gaming laptops and turns them into something designed specifically for video editors, illustrators, and creators, as well as to take on Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Apple has had a fairly sizable share of the creator market for years with their MacBook and MacBook Pro. However, it&#8217;s also no secret that more and more creators are starting to look towards cheaper, Windows alternatives. The market is already starting to respond, but there just aren&#8217;t that many alternatives yet. Consider the Acer ConceptD laptops as the latest and one of the best in the growing line of reasons why creators should switch over to Windows and eschew Apple starting today.</p>
<p>Acer announced their new brand, ConceptD, earlier on April 11, Thursday, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Acer ConceptD laptops will initially come in three variants, each designed to help position the company to give creators a viable Windows alternative to the MacBook Pro at various price points.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Acer ConceptD Laptops</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5481 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-ConceptD-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Acer ConceptD Laptops" width="1200" height="792" />The ConceptD 9 is the flagship of Acer&#8217;s latest line. Acer claims that they designed it specifically for drawing and 3D work. To this end, they equipped the Concept D 9 with a convertible 17-inch 4K display. Not only that, but the display is also Pantone validated and has a near-perfect &lt;1 Delta-E accuracy rating for maximum color accuracy. The display also uses the same Ezel Aero Hinge as that of the Predator Triton 900 and comes with built-in support for Wacom pen.</p>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0N4Y1-G1zU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Under the hood, the ConceptD 9 comes equipped with a latest ninth-generation Intel Core i9 CPU, an RTX 2080 GPU, as well as support for up 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage space. For modern accessibility, Acer equipped the ConceptD 9 with Thunderbolt 3, USB Type-C and DisplayPort 1.4 ports.</p>
<p>The ConceptD 9&#8217;s smaller brother, the ConceptD 7, is a bit smaller. It sports a 15.6-inch 4K display and &#8220;only&#8221; comes with up to a Core i7 processor. You can also choose to have it with an RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU or the RTX 2060. The ConceptD 7 also doesn&#8217;t have the same convertible screen as the flagship of the line, nor the same pen support. However, it does come with the same storage and RAM options, making it a more traditional and more affordable laptop alternative.</p>
<p>Finally, the ConceptD 5 is the least powerful of the three. It still has the same 15.6-inch 4K panel as that of the ConceptD 7. However, underneath, it&#8217;s a bit slower, albeit still capable, with 8th-Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors powering it, along with the AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPU. Both RAM, as well as storage options, are also limited for the ConceptD5 compared to the ConceptD 7 and Concept D9. But, if it&#8217;s any consolation, the Concept D5 is the smallest and lightest of all the Acer ConceptD laptops.</p>
<h3>When Are the Acer ConceptD Laptops Going to Release?</h3>
<p>The Acer ConceptD 5 and ConceptD 7 will start selling as early as later this month of April. The former will start selling at a $1,699 price point, while the latter will set users back at least $2,299. The more powerful Acer ConceptD 9 is not set to launch until later on in June. The flagship product of the new line will start selling at a $4,999 price point.</p>
