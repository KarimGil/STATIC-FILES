										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when you had to spend a hell lot of money to buy a good laptop because now many laptop manufacturers are offering decent performing laptops for the price lesser than $200! They are best for basic everyday tasks, but still, there are many tasks which these cheap laptops can&#8217;t perform. So which are the best laptops under $200? Are the laptops under 200 dollars really worth buying? Let&#8217;s find it out.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span></p>
<p><em>Of course, while buying the budget laptop, you have to keep your expectations in check, but when the budget is $200, you really have to take that seriously!</em></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t expect to play the newest games or perform demanding tasks such as video editing on these budget laptops, because the Windows Netbooks and Chromebooks that you would usually find in this price range are simply not made for it. They run on the lightweight operating systems such as Windows 10 S and Chrome OS and are powered by an entry-level CPUs paired with very less amount of RAM and storage which although can&#8217;t handle demanding workloads, they are perfect for everyday productivity tasks such as surfing the web, editing documents, managing small excel sheets and creating presentations. They also come in a very small and lightweight form factor, and as its less powerful hardware consumes very less power, most of them have good battery life as well.</p>
<p>So, they can be a great option for frequent travelers, students, or anyone who wants an inexpensive laptop for answering emails, editing documents, and other such basic tasks. However, for anything more than that, the sub-$200 laptops will be way underpowered. If you were expecting more from these budget notebooks, then we strongly recommend you to increase your budget and check out other <a title="More Budget Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/budget-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget laptop buying guides</a> on our website which includes more capable laptops that cost just slightly more than $200.</p>
<p>Well, if you think that these budget laptops are what you have been looking for, then as I said earlier, while searching for the best cheap laptops in the market, you will see there are mostly Windows laptops and Chromebooks available to buy under $200 budget. So, the first thing which you have to decide is whether you should buy a Windows laptop or a Chromebook?</p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">Windows Laptop or Chromebook: What should you buy under $200?</h4>
<hr>
<p>To buy the best and reliable laptop within your limited budget, you have to decide whether Windows laptops&nbsp;are best for your daily needs or Chromebooks. Below are a few comparisons&nbsp;which shall&nbsp;give you a proper idea of what is Chromebook and how it is different from Windows laptop that you&#8217;re probably used to.&nbsp;Go through it and then take your decision for&nbsp;buying the best cheap laptop under 200 dollars for yourself.</p>
<p>If you already know what you&#8217;re looking for then feel free to skip this and begin with the list of our top laptop picks below.</p>
<ul>
<li>As we all know Windows is the most used operating system on computers so getting used to a new windows laptop will be no problem for most of us. Whereas, Chrome OS, on the other hand, is still found on very limited laptops. While getting used to it won&#8217;t be much problem, as its UI is almost similar to using Chrome on Windows laptop but for those who don&#8217;t use Chrome, it can be a bit of work.</li>
<li>There are no software compatibility problems on Windows laptops. You can download apps and games from Microsoft Store and even install software from other third-party sources. On the other hand, Chromebooks are still limited to apps in the Chrome web store. Google added the Android Play Store support to the Chrome OS and many older Chromebooks did get the software update for that, but it is still available on the <a title="List of Chromebooks Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">selected models</a> only. Moreover, the apps on Play Store aren&#8217;t fully optimized for the Chromebooks, so if you are planning to use the android apps on your Chromebook, then make sure to get the touch-enabled one.</li>
<li>If you are looking for a cheap laptop to work on the MS Office, then definitely Windows laptop is the only option, as Chrome OS doesn&#8217;t support it yet. However, if you rely on Google&#8217;s suite of applications heavily and have to work online mostly, then nothing can beat Chromebooks at that. Chromebooks are also fast and battery efficient than Windows laptops as Chrome OS is a very lightweight cloud-based operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more differences between them, but these are the major ones.&nbsp;You can check out this guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3280998/laptop-computers/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebooks vs Windows Laptops</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;more in-depth&nbsp;idea about it.&nbsp;Keep your needs in mind and then decide whether you should buy a Chromebook under $200 or Windows laptop under $200.</p>
</div>

<p>So, now as you have decided what type of laptop you want to&nbsp;buy for yourself,&nbsp;we can proceed with the list of best laptops to buy under your budget of 200 dollars.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Note -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px">All budget laptops under $200 come with a very little amount of internal storage (64GB at most) so to buy a laptop with more storage (500GB or 1TB HDD), we recommend you to increase your budget a bit and have a look at <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our guide to buy the best laptop under $300</a>.

We had quite a long and good time spending with this laptop, and here is our full review of it:<span id="more-1766"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Although the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ is the cheapest chromebook available in the market, it does a pretty good job in offering a clean and polished exteriors. The laptop comes with a white case, which although looks neat and clean feels cheap. During our usage, we also felt that the laptop was hollow in certain areas from the chassis. One thing which is admirable in the laptop is its ruggedness. The chassis of the laptop doesn&#8217;t attract any smudges or scratches on it. On an overall note, the Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ is quite good for the asking price. Do note that you&#8217;re getting this laptop at the price of a toy. Uh, a costly toy maybe.</p>

Key alignment and the keypad’s placement is largely similar to that of all other chromebooks. The keys are clear, visible, and are unfortunately not backlit enabled. The keyboard comes with good mechanics and all the keys offer good tactile feedback. Using TypingTest.com, I managed to score around 92 words per minute with six errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my MacBook Air. All that said, the laptop does offer a great keyboard for the asking price.</p>

<p>As far as the touchpad on this laptop is concerned, it is nice and spacious and works well with multitouch gestures as well. The laptop offers gestures including—touch to click, double touch to right-click, swipe with three fingers to switch between apps and much more based on the customisation. But we didn&#8217;t have a pleasant time using the mechanical click buttons on the trackpad. During our usage, these mechanical clicks often got stuck, which was annoying.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Coming to the display segment of the laptop, the Acer Chromebook CB3 sports an 11.6-inch HD display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The display is of IPS LED type and comes with the Acer’s proprietary ComfyView Widescreen technology for a better viewing experience. Also, the screen is set to a fixed aspect ratio of 16:9. The matte display on the CB3 gains it an advantage when it comes to providing adequate brightness without hurting eyes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1830" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ Laptop - Display" width="750" height="474" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-300x190.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-610x386.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-600x379.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Not to mention, the laptop is priced under $200. The screen is combined with a laid back wide angles along with the decent amount of brightness and contrast. Matte finish on the display makes it suitable for almost all the indoor usage conditions.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Before we start giving out the specifications and hardware stuff of this Chromebook, we would like the viewers to first recollect the price of this device and proceed down. Under the hood, the laptop packs in a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2840 processor. The laptop is dual-core and with the help of Intel Burst technology, the laptop can achieve a clock speed of 2.58GHz. For multitasking, the Acer Chromebook 11 is equipped with a 2GB of DDR3L RAM, which is although very less when compared to other Windows-based laptops, is quite adequate for Chrome OS.</p>
<p>For graphics, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ ships with an integrated intel graphics processor, which takes care of rendering minor graphics. For storage, it offers a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-expandable</span> 16GB of solid state drive internal storage, which we feel is the major letdown for this budget-friendly Chromebook. However, if you&#8217;re always connected to the internet, then Google is offering free 100GB of online cloud storage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 offers an HD web camera at top of the screen. The camera is pretty fast in adjusting images on the frame. The shot to shot time is also comparatively very less than those in its competitors. The laptop is ideal for Skype or any other video calls due to its compact-sized weight.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1832" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Porst and Slots" width="1100" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 1100w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-300x112.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-768x288.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-610x228.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-600x225.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" />This pint-sized value-for-money laptop comes with a USB 3.0 port for faster file transfers. There is another USB 2.0 port, which comes quite handy if one requires connecting an additional peripheral. The laptop also comes with an HDMI port with HDCP port for wired media sharing.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ runs on the Google’s proprietary Chrome OS, which is a lightweight operating system for laptops. The OS is well-known for its resource utilisation and can deliver decent performance even under a feeble set of specifications. Accordingly, the CB3 offers a very decent performance for the hardware it packs in.</p>
<p>Although the software on the laptop offers a couple of interesting features such as file viewer, app grid, document editor, and more, there are few segments wherein, the software struggles. During our usage, we clearly felt that the software is not very well polished. However, we hope that it gets fixed with some regular updates. The Acer Chromebook CB3 is one among the <a title="Chrome OS Systems Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very few laptops listed</a> to eventually get access to the Google Play Store. In addition to that, it comes with all the popular Google’s lineup of apps with built-in: Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Hangouts.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>What performance would you expect from a laptop costing $160? That said, we aren&#8217;t demoting this laptop in any manner. It&#8217;s just that the hardware packed in the CB3 is very basic and evidently one cannot expect a class-leading performance from it. A dual-core entry-level mobile processor paired with a 2GB of RAM is although capable of handling basic tasks, it struggles under heavy usage. The best part is, the laptop is fan-less and therefore, doesn&#8217;t produce any sound during usage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Exterior" width="740" height="655" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg 740w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-300x266.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-610x540.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-600x531.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-50x44.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" />All the daily essentials such as browsing internet, handling text editors and readers runs fine without any considerable lag in them. In fact, we were quite amused from the performance and apps handling in the CB3. The laptop is pretty fast and quick when compared to the Windows counterpart. The Chrome OS is a great add-on for this entry-level laptop as there are not many background applications and services in Chrome OS as compared to a Windows OS.</p>

<p>On the connectivity front, the laptop supports a dual band 802.11ac WiFi featuring the company’s proprietary MIMO technology for faster network reception.</p>
<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, the laptop does quite good in handling graphics. Especially, considering the basic integrated graphics on the device. We ran few games such as tank rider and speed racer games, which although are light on graphics are quite entertaining. To our surprise, the laptop handled them all without any kind of lags or hiccups.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with two built-in stereo speakers which support high definition audio. We tried playing high definition FLAC files, for which the laptop did pretty well. The sound output is although not very loud, the audio produced is easily sufficient to fill a small sized room. We also tried playing some Full HD and 2K video content on the chromebook 11, for which the laptop did really well. Sadly, the laptop struggled a lot to handle 4K content.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ stays pumped up using a 36 watt-hour battery, which is quite average considering the specifications. However, Acer did really well to squeeze a little more from the battery. Even during our usage, the laptop managed to deliver about 8 hours of continuous usage, which included watching videos running few basic benchmarks and browsing. During all the time, the WiFi was enabled. Therefore, we expect the laptop to deliver a little more of battery backup when the network reception is disabled. The laptop can be fully charged in less than 2 hours which is great.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11" width="750" height="560" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-300x224.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-610x455.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-600x448.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />On an overall note, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6-Inch Laptop is a complete value for money offering from Acer. The laptop not only managed to impress us, but also amazed us with some aspects such as battery life and performance.
