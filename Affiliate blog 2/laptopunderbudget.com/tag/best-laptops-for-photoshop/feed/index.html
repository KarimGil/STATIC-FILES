										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of Course, photographers need a camera to take pictures, but after taking pictures, they need a laptop using which they can see those captured images on a bigger display, color correct the raw files, and finalize the shots. Therefore, the laptop is the second most important thing in a photographer’s life after their beloved cameras. And just like cameras, buying the best laptop for photographers is also no less than a herculean task. There are a lot of things to check in a laptop for photo editing, and people often make mistakes in choosing the right one. So, what are the important things to check on a photographer’s laptop? And, what are the best laptops available in the market for photo editing? Let’s find them out…<br />
<span id="more-1685"></span></p>
<p>Most photographers have an initial thought of buying a desktop instead of the laptop for photo editing, and we also know that many of you are still confused about making the right choice between them. So, let us begin by discussing this in a little context to help you decide whether desktops or laptops are good for photo editing.</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-outline vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Desktops vs Laptops: What is&nbsp;best for Photo Editing?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Both laptops and desktops have their pros and cons. So, what&#8217;s best for you depends on your profession and your working style &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re a traveling photographer then definitely the choice for you would be the laptop as traveling with the desktop is not possible. Hence, you will need a lightweight and powerful laptop to view and edit your captured photos on the go.</li>
<li>Whereas, if you are a designer or have to work from a fixed place, then I would recommend you to buy the desktop for your photo editing works because desktops are cheaper, &#8220;more powerful&#8221; and also easy to upgrade than laptops.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Don't get me wrong,</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"></p>
<p>Laptops are also powerful, but the processors inside the laptops are mobile variants, so they are clocked to work at lower speeds to deliver better battery backup. However, this isn&#8217;t a problem with <a title="Intel Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by newer generation processors</a> because newer generation mobile processors significantly reduce that&nbsp;performance gap between desktops and laptops.</p>
<p>Even the newer mobile GPUs are powerful enough to easily carry out intensive photo editing work on laptops using softwares like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.</p>
<p></div></div>
<p>So,&nbsp;buying a laptop&nbsp;for photo editing isn&#8217;t a bad choice at all, but the only thing you need to know is, you will trade in a little performance for the portability you get in the&nbsp;laptop. Whereas, desktops are best at delivering raw performance.</p>
</div>

<p>Now it&#8217;s totally up to you as you know what&#8217;s right for you and what isn&#8217;t. So, if you opted for a desktop then probably we should say each other a goodbye because we are not going to talk about desktops here.</p>

</ul>
<p>Well, if you have decided to buy a laptop for your photo editing works, then there are a lot of crucial things to check in the laptop which will be specifically used for running intensive photo editing softwares like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.</p>
<p>So, before we proceed with the list of best laptops for photo editing, let&#8217;s discuss all the important things to check in the laptop for photographers and photo editing works.</p>

	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Important Things to Check in the&nbsp;Laptop for Photographers and Photo Editing</h3>
<hr>
<p>We do have&nbsp;our expert&#8217;s recommended best&nbsp;laptops for photo editing listed below which will not require you to check anything, but if you opt to buy any laptop which is not&nbsp;in our list below then make sure&nbsp;to check these things in the laptop to make it a perfect buy for photo editing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel i5 or i7 Processor &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;The CPU plays a vital role in deciding the overall performance of any computer. And, for running power demanding softwares like Photoshop you&#8217;ll need a powerful CPU. We recommend you to get the <a title="Best i5 Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop with newer generation Intel i5</a> or <a title="Best i7 Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">i7 processor</a>. The <a title="Best i3 Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by Intel Core i3 processor</a> can also work well if you are a beginner in this field, but for future proofing it is better to invest in a laptop with Intel Core i5 processor.</li>
<li><strong>At least 8GB of RAM &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>As a professional photo editor or photographer, you&#8217;ll be working with multiple files and programs simultaneously. So, to make sure that your laptop always runs smoothly while editing photos, we recommend at least 8GB of RAM in the laptop for photo editing. Also, check for the extra RAM slots so that if required you can increase the RAM of your laptop in the future.</li>
<li><strong>256GB or more &#8220;SSD&#8221; Storage &#8211;</strong> As a photographer, you&#8217;ll click a lot of pictures from your DSLR camera and the average size of each image captured from DSLR cameras is about 15MB, so you will need a lot of storage space to store all of them. You can buy a laptop with 1TB of hard drive which will allow you to save all your photos on the laptop, but we recommend you to buy a laptop with SSD. Get the laptop with a 256GB or if your budget allows 512GB SSD and buy an external hard drive to keep the backup of the images you&#8217;ve completed editing. We recommend SSD because SSDs are faster than hard drives and it also improves the overall performance of the laptop.</li>
<li><strong>2GB or More Dedicated Graphics &#8211;&nbsp;</strong> These days we don&#8217;t need the dedicated graphics card in a laptop for photo editing because integrated graphics on newer processors can also handle intensive softwares without any problems, but we recommend to have at least 2GB of dedicated graphics because it will help while editing high-resolution photos. However, if you have to deal with extremely high-resolution images and also some video editing work occasionally, then we would recommend you to get a better graphics backed laptop. Nvidia&#8217;s MX250 GPU is great for mediocre photo editing work, but for high-resolution photos and video editing, we recommend Nvidia&#8217;s GTX and RTX line of GPUs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full HD Display with Good&nbsp;Color Accuracy &#8211;</strong> Last but not least, the display of the laptop for photo editing should be bright and the one that displays accurate colors (check sRGB rating). We recommend display with full HD resolution (i.e. 1920 x 1080) for normal editing work, but if you have to edit very high resolution images then you&#8217;ll need a laptop with 4K display (i.e. 3840 x 2160) for editing such photos.</li>
</ul>

<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#000000;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#000000;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">PRO TIP</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px">Editing photos using the trackpad on laptops or with the mouse might not be the best experience.</p>
<p>Most professionals use the graphics tablets with pens for drawing and photo editing works. Graphics tablets when connected with the laptops give a whole new experience for designers and professional photographers because those tablets come with pressure sensitivity which gives more precision and accuracy in photo editing softwares such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.</p>
<p>So, in case if you&#8217;re looking for best graphics tablet for yourself, then you can check out our guide to buy the <a title="The Best Tablets for Photoshop – Our Top Picks for Best Photo-Editing Tablets" href="https://tabletunderbudget.com/photo-editing-tablets-for-photoshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best tablets for photo editing</a> on our sister site <em>&#8216;Tablet Under Budget&#8217;</em>.</div></div>

<h3>4. LG Gram 17 <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Large Screen Option</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3bgsM9j" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-Gram-17.jpg" alt="LG Gram 17 - best large screen laptop for photo editing" width="550" height="416"></a></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t want to miss the standard PC feel, the LG Gram 17 is a perfect option. It comes with a large <strong>17-inch IPS display with 114% of color gamut</strong> and powerful hardware which makes it the best 17-inch laptop for photo editing right now. Its chassis is made from the special metal alloy and it complies with the 810G Military Standard so it is perfect for photographers who travels a lot and has to edit pictures on-the-go. Moreover, it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world&#8217;s lightest 17-inch laptop</span> weighing in at just 2.9 pounds, so you won&#8217;t be lugging this laptop around like other 17-inch laptops.</p>
<p>The colorful display and portable chassis isn&#8217;t all the laptop has got. It also comes with an equally tempting set of powerful configuration making it a very good laptop for photoshop. With its powerful Intel Core i7 processor paired up with a massive 16GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD, the LG Gram 17 laptop can handle quite a lot of tasks with ease.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about the price tag, the laptop costs around $1800 and for the price it offers an excellent package overall, but it comes with Intel&#8217;s integrated Iris Plus graphics. That said, it can still handle all sorts of photo editing work on Photoshop or Lightroom without any problems, but it would struggle if you would try to edit videos on it. So, if you are looking for a large screen laptop solely for photo editing only, then LG Gram 17 is probably the best option right now.</p>

<h3>5. Apple MacBook Pro 16 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best MacBook for Photo Editing</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_5926" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://amzn.to/2S8bfZG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5926" class="wp-image-5926 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Apple-MacBook-Pro-16.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16 - Best Laptop for Professional Photographers" width="550" height="319"></a><p id="caption-attachment-5926" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Best Compact and High-end Laptop for Professional Photographers</strong></p></div>
<p>Have you ever been to a professional photographer or video producer&#8217;s studio? The chances of they using a Mac is way higher than using a Windows-based laptop. That said, Apple’s MacBooks and iMacs are widely used for handling high-end graphics tools for image and video processing. And here is a compact yet, very powerful MacBook Pro 15, which comes with a stunning <strong>16-inch True Tone Retina display with 3072 x 1920 Resolution</strong>.</p>
<p>For the internals, it is powered by the latest generation six-core Intel Core i7 processor paired up with a 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. This not only provides seamless multitasking, but also provides a very fast and reliable storage option. For the graphics, the laptop comes with dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 5300M GPU, which boosts up the graphics handling performance of the laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with an all-metal unibody chassis, which gives it a premium look and feel. Moreover, this MacBook comes with a powerful set of photo and video editing tools including <strong>huge trackpad and the touch bar above the keyboard which aids a lot while editing photos in Photoshop on this laptop</strong>.</p>
<p>However, not everything about the MacBook Pro is praiseworthy. It has just 4 ports, 2 on either side and all of them are Thunderbolt USB Type-C. So, to transfer photos from your camera to the laptop you will need a dongle which isn&#8217;t included in the box. Moreover, its price is also comparatively higher than the similarly specced Windows laptops. That said, the MacBook Pro 15 is still one of the most preferred laptop by professionals because of its performance and reliability.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e54c;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF66;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">If you think you can make it with the small display, then <strong>MacBook Pro 13</strong> is also an excellent pick for photo editing. While it doesn&#8217;t come with dedicated GPU, the integrated Intel Iris graphics 655 on it is also more than enough for photo editing. So, if you want to save a bit and think that you will be fine with a smaller display, then MacBook Pro 13 is also worth checking out. | <a href="https://amzn.to/3bhQ2nn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check price on Amazon</a></div></div>

<h3>6. HP ENVY 13t 4K Laptop <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Value for Money</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2SaVD7v" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4032 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HP-Envy-13t.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13t - best laptop for photoshop with 4K display under 1000" width="584" height="376"></a></p>
<p>The HP Envy 13 is one of our most recommended laptops for photographers who have to edit pictures on the go. The reason behind that is it offers 4K display in a lightweight, streamlined chassis, that too, at an affordable price. While most of the models with 4K display cost more than $1500, with this HP Envy 13, you can get it for around $1000.</p>
<p>It comes with a 13.3-inch 4K touchscreen display which is vivid and crisp looking. Speaking about the specifications of the laptop, it comes with 8th Generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM. Although the processor is slightly old, it is still a competent one. It also features a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU which makes it a very capable performer when it comes to intensive media creation and editing work. Moreover, the laptop comes with a 512GB of SSD, which we think is more than enough for a photographer’s needs.</p>
<p>However, the battery backup of this laptop isn’t that great. It can last up to 5 to 6 hours on a single charge which could fall short if you travel a lot. But on an overall note, this HP Envy 13 laptop still offers excellent value for its price, and it is a complete package for budget buyers who don’t want to compromise on features.</p>
