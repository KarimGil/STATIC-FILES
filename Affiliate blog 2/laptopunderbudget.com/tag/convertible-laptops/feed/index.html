										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has announced its refreshed lineup of convertible laptops series Pavilion x360. In an announcement made earlier today, Hewlett Packard has introduced three new laptops in three different screen sizes &#8211; 11.6-inches, 14-inches, and 15.6-inches. The OEM&#8217;s Pavilion x360 series consisting of 2-in-1 laptops are known for featuring a touch screen, seamless design, and powerful performance. With its refreshed lineup, HP has tried to entice users with budget constraints who are looking forward to purchase a laptop that doubles up as a tablet.</p>
<p>Here are the new Pavilion x360 convertible laptops along with their specifications.</p>
<h3>1. HP Pavilion x360  11 &#8211; A 11.6-inch fanless convertible laptop</h3>
<p>Out of the three newly announced convertible laptops, HP Pavilion x360 11 is the cheapest and only model to feature a fanless design. It is a sleek and lightweight 2-in-1 laptop having an 11.6-inches display weighing just 2.7 pounds. The laptop is powered by an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 quad-core Gemini Lake processor which is pretty decent for an entry-level laptop. It features 4GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage. HP Pavilion x360 11 is supported by a 37.69 Wh battery and is accompanied with a 45-watt power adapter. HP has said that the 11-inch notebook will offer up to 10:45 hours of battery life.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5396" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1122-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 11 - 2019" width="581" height="386" /></p>
<p>Additionally, for connectivity,  the laptop has  802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 (5Gb/s) port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports, a headset jack, and a microSD card reader. The HP Pavilion x360 11 starts at $400 and will be available from May onwards.</p>
<h3>2. HP Pavilion x360 14 &#8211; A 14-inch convertible laptop supporting 8th Gen i7 Processors</h3>
<p>Next in the refreshed x360 lineup is a 14-inch convertible PC which is aimed at power users. HP Pavilion x360 14 features an exciting design with a 3-sided micro edge display that makes bezels thinner. On the design front, HP boasts that it has provided a new hourglass edge to make it easier for users to open the laptop easily from all three sides. However, at 0.8-inches thick and weighing 4.3 pounds, it is not as stylish and portable as the 11-inch x360.</p>
<p>Unlike its 11-inch sibling, it is configurable and supports up to 8th generation Intel Core i7 processors. Carrying an HD display having 1366 X 768 resolution or optional 1080p display, the base variant of x360 14 comes with an Intel Core i3-8145U processor, Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM and internal storage of 128GB. The laptop supports up to 1TB HDD and up to 512GB PCIe SSD.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5397" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1422-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 14 - 2019" width="696" height="536" /></p>
<p>For more power, it also supports up to Intel Core i7- 8565U processor, 16GB of RAM and NVIDIA Geforce MX130 or newest MX250 graphics card. HP has provided 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a USB Type-C Generation 1 port, an HDMI 1.4 port, a 3.5mm audio jack, an SD card reader and two USB 3.1 Type &#8211; A Gen 1 ports. A fingerprint reader is also available for users as an extra option for authentication. The company has said that x360 14 will provide the battery life of up to 11 hours.</p>
<p>HP Pavilion x360 14 starts at $500 and will be available in the market from April onwards.</p>
<h3>3. HP Pavilion x360 15 &#8211; a 15-inch convertible laptop supporting AMD Radeon 535 graphics card</h3>
<p>For large screen seekers, HP has announced its x360 15 that sports a 15.6-inch display with 1366&#215;768  or 1920&#215;1080 resolution. It shares its design with its 14-inch sibling and features the same hourglass edge and 3-sided micro-edge display for design with thinner bezels. Measuring 14.1″ x 8.4″ x 0.8″, this model weighs 4.3 pounds which is, again, not lightweight exactly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5398" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1522-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 15 - 2019" width="723" height="495" /></p>
<p>On the performance front, HP Pavilion x360 15 also supports 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and a couple of storage options. This model also supports AMD Radeon 535 graphics card and can be used for purposes like video editing, animation and much more. You can configure x360 15 with up to 2TB HDD and up to 512GB PCIe SSD. HP has provided a multi-format card reader, a USB Type-C port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports and a 3.5mm port for audio accessories.</p>
<p>The Pavilion x360 15 has its downside in the form of the same 41 Wh battery which means that we cannot expect a long battery life from it.</p>
<p>HP Pavilion x360 15 starts at $800 and will be available from  April this year.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">All the three new Pavilion convertibles will be available in different color options &#8211; Cloud Blue, Pale Gold, and HP&#8217;s standard Natural Silver color. Also, HP convertibles are fitted with dual speakers and HP audio boost with Audio by B&amp;O.</span></p>
<p>In addition to convertible laptops, HP has also announced two new monitors including one with 27f 4K Display and another featuring 34f Curved Display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right after HP and a bunch of other tech vendors, Acer has upped their game for their budget Chromebooks lineup and announced the Chromebook 512 and Chromebook Spin 512 at the 2019 BETT Show in <span class="xn-location">London</span>. Chromebooks are usually categorized in the &#8216;student-friendly&#8217; category. It is due to the affordability and the sturdiness that the Chrome OS based notebooks are usually built with.</p>
<p>But to get one step ahead, Acer threw in a Windows based option as well in their educational lineup. The TravelMate B114-21.</p>
<h3>Acer Chromebook Spin 512 and Acer Chromebook 512</h3>
<p>Both Chromebooks have IPS displays of 12-inches and 1366 x 912 resolution. There is however, the choice for a convertible or a non-convertible version. And as obvious with the name, the Acer Chromebook Spin 512 features a 360-degree hinge. The hinge along with the Gorilla Glass antimicrobial coating, enables four different usage modes. A tablet mode for mostly reading, notebook mode for writing and sketching, display mode for getting a clearer view of the screen, and a tent mode for presentations, editing and collaborating.</p>
<p>Another treat is the included Wacom electro-magnetic resonance (EMR) stylus. For its placement, there is dock embedded in the notebook&#8217;s body itself. Sounds pretty chic for a budget notebook, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>The Acer Chromebook Spin 512 comes with an amazing 8 MP world facing HDR webcam, with auto-focus and an 88-degree wide-FOV.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-5233 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Chromebook-spin-512.jpg" alt="" width="646" height="363" /></p>
<p>Both Chromebooks deliver an exceptional battery backup, ranging up to 12 hours that means day and night support for students for at least a couple of days.</p>
<p>Not only are these notebooks extremely elegant, interactive and cheap but also come with military grade robustness. These babies can withstand drops from a 4 ft height and can handle up to 60 kg (132 pounds) of exerted force. All possible due to the strengthened design and shock-absorbing bumper.</p>
<p>Another unique factor of these laptops is that they meet two major toy safety standards and have been declared safe for use for kids. This might be credited to its moisture resistant touchpad and spill-resistant keyboard. It drains any liquid out of the bottom of the chassis, providing protection to the internal components.</p>
<p>For the configurations, Acer has loaded these notebooks with an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 processor, an 8GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage, with lower configuration options also available.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5236 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/acer_chromebook-512.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="297" />Acer has priced both these notebooks for under $500 which is affordable enough for struggling students and for parents supporting them. The Acer Chromebook Spin 512 starts at $449.99 and the Acer Chromebook 512 comes in at $329.99 with their availability expected around April.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA Laptop Review – The Best Cheap Notebook?" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-1-2018-a114-32-c1ya-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer Aspire 1 Review &#8211; The Best Cheap Notebook?</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>TravelMate B114-21</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5234 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Travelmate-B114-21.jpg" alt="" width="632" height="396" />Now its quite understandable for techies to disregard Chromebooks completely no matter how flashy they might be. Considering the instability of Chrome OS with certain apps and its limitations. To cater such users, Acer also released a Windows-based, budget learning companion for students.</p>
<p>Now what makes this notebook categorized under &#8216;educational&#8217;, is its S mode feature. The laptop&#8217;s configurations go up to a 7th Gen AMD A6-9220C processor with integrated Radeon R5 graphics, 16GB of RAM for efficient multitasking and a fast 256GB SSD storage. These combined, ensure powerful support for learning activities and some decent softwares. It also features a generous selection of ports. Including 1 x USB 3.1 port, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a memory card reader, an Ethernet port and an HDMI 2.0 port. However, it misses out on the USB Type-C port.</p>
<p>What Acer has kept uniform among this educational lineup release is the military grade strength of the machine. And yes of-course the affordable price tag. Compliant with the tough U.S. Military Standard MIL-STD 810G, the TravelMate sports a rugged rubber bumper with a shock resistant body. These altogether make the laptop resilient to almost all kinds of bumps, and hits. It can also handle drops from up to 122 cms. It&#8217;s good to see that despite the cheap cost, Acer has added a 14-inch FHD display, and a 180-degree hinge to this laptop&#8217;s specs.</p>
<p>Acer claims that the TravelMate will offer up to almost 10 hours of battery backup, coming quite close to the Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Acer has priced TravelMate for around $320 and is expected to release it for purchase by mid-year 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is planning to rule over the education market with their latest Intel-based Chromebook announcements. The HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 and HP Chromebook 11 G7 EE.</p>
<p>HP plans on releasing these notebooks around April which is just the right time for tech vendors to release contrabands for school year buying cycle. Chromebooks being one of the most popular purchases for students and teachers could definitely use an upgrade like this in 2019.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The best laptops for college students of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For instance, the HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 Education Edition is loaded with the latest Intel Celeron processors N4100 or N4000 and Intel UHD Graphics 600. Alongside is its claimed 11.5-hour battery life which if true, is hard to find standup average in budget notebooks. The device is also convertible, and the 360-degree hinge can hold up support in tablet, tent, stand and laptop modes. There is also an optional HP Wacom EMR pen, dual cameras, and support for type, touch, write, capture, and draw gestures as well.</p>
<p>The device also dons a good port selection and contains USB-C ports on each side, a USB 3 Type-A port, a microSD card reader, a Headset jack, 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0. For the storage, HP has equipped this Chromebook with 64 GB eMMC storage and comes with 8GB of RAM for efficient multitasking. Additionally, it comes with a 2-year subscription to 100GB Google Drive which is a nice little bow to seal the package with.</p>
<p>With the same convertibility, port selection and the 11.6-inch screen size as its sibling x360 11 G2, the Chromebook 11 G7 EE is a more traditional take in this lineup. What the 11 G7 EE doesn&#8217;t have is its sibling&#8217;s 5MP world facing camera while both hold a 720p front-facing webcam. However, it does weight lighter &#8211; reaching about 2.9 pounds, as opposed to the 3.2 pounds of the x360 11 G2.</p>
<p>Another feature these both notebooks share is the configuration of processors and RAM, whereas the storage options in the G7 are available from 16GB to 64GB of eMMC 5.0 storage.</p>
<p>But the most impressive upgrade made by HP is shared by both Chromebooks that is the military grade robustness. Not only is it an extremely hard feature to find in budget Chromebooks like these, but it&#8217;s an addition that no one expected to get. The Chromebooks sport a minor-spill-resistant keyboard, shock-absorbing body, and Corning Gorilla Glass protection. It can also withstand a 76-centimeter drop on concrete. We think that HP paid attention to the rough routine that students usually put their laptops through and devised a solution that holds not only powerful internals but also keeps good and strong shape on the outside as well.</p>
<p>HP is yet to reveal the prices of these notebooks which will tell us a lot more about these upgrades, but until then, we can&#8217;t help but hope for it all to be good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far as CES 2019 is concerned, ASUS has been at the top of their game. They have come up with the most accessible, yet innovative solutions to cater to almost every kind of audience. Not a few days ago, ASUS introduced <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-officially-unveils-four-new-chromebooks-ces-2019/">rugged and thick notebooks for students and kids</a> &#8211; able to withstand almost any sort drop and bump that you can imagine. Now, they are back with a more premium and exquisite version of their well-worshipped Flip C302, named the Chromebook Flip C434.</p>
<p>The ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 boasts a beautiful edge-to-edge screen and the signature Flip 360 hinge as its main attractions. The chassis is an all-metal aluminum body weighing just about 3.3 pounds and is only 15.7 mm thick. The rough rubber might be durable but there is just something about a silver metal finish you can&#8217;t turn away from. Plus its a good camouflage for those nasty fingerprints as well. The 2-in-1 book&#8217;s 360 ErgoLift hinge transforms the device into a traditional laptop, tablet, and tent modes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5087" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ASUS-Chromebook-Flip-C434-1.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook Flip C434" width="599" height="498" /></p>
<p>Now, the ASUS Flip C302 was a classic success among budget users no doubt, as it provided great value for money. The Flip C434 not only does maintain the same aspect but also comes with a bunch of new upgrades. For instance now there is support for Intel’s 8th Gen Y-Series (choice between an i7-8500Y, i5-8200Y, or M3-8100Y) CPUs and the addition of a USB-A port. Apart from the affordability, there are still a lot of similarities left between the older and the latest version. Like the 8GB of RAM, upto 128GB of storage, and the microSD card slot.</p>
<p>The reason ASUS is able to offer premium looks, mid-range price, portability, and a good processor is due to the lightweight ChromeOS. This lightweight operating system has been a long companion of budget users and comes in good looking books as well. Just like the ASUS Chromebook Flip C434 which stands out with its Full HD NanoEdge 14-inch touchscreen display. And that too with maintaining the very &#8216;in&#8217; trend of slim bezels which are just 5mm on this one. What&#8217;s even more impressive is that they have still to fit in a front facing camera at the top.</p>
<p>ASUS also hasn&#8217;t lost the chiclet keyboard that provides one of the most comfortable typing experiences and is also backlit. And thanks to the flexible hinge, the experience just gets better.</p>

<p>ASUS has announced this all-purpose premium ultrabook to be out in a few months. For the price &#8211; ASUS points out that instead of going overboard with either fancy specs or huge savings, they have decided to level both and offer surpassing specs within a mid-range cost and is offering its notebook with a starting price of $569.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we hear the term &#8216;business laptops&#8217; our first instinct is to inch away as the name mostly endears high-end users. Even for users who&#8217;s lifestyle demands sleek and powerful machines, are often forced into settling for less. Given ofcourse the price sensitivity. Lenovo has thought outside of this social convention with their two latest releases. The Lenovo ThinkPad L390 and Lenovo ThinkPad L390 Yoga.</p>
<p>Now we are aware that these laptops might not fit the exact definition of &#8216;versatile professional laptops&#8217; but they do come pretty close and are a step in the right direction. Let&#8217;s see what Lenovo has to offer.</p>
<h3>Display, Size, and Weight</h3>
<p>While both laptops sport a 13.3 inch full HD touchscreen display, the Yoga L390 is a flexible version of its sibling. Yoga can be twisted and turned into almost every angle whereas, the L390 supports a 180-degree hinge and can be laid out flat on a surface. However, it is slightly lighter than its more flexible counterpart.</p>
<div id="attachment_4815" style="width: 785px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4815" class="wp-image-4815 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Lenovo-ThinkPad-L390-Yoga.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad L390 Yoga" width="775" height="533" /><p id="caption-attachment-4815" class="wp-caption-text">Lenovo ThinkPad L390 Yoga</p></div>
<p>Its total weight rounds up to 3.2 lbs, a fraction less than the Lenovo Yoga L390 that weighs up to 3.44 lbs and is just 8.8&#8243; in width. The ThinkPad L390 Yoga does come with an additional plus that is the Active Stylus pen support that can be placed in its built-in garage slot. Sweetening the deal up a bit more, it sports a full 360-degree hinge to use it as a tablet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Artists with Pen Support</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Processor and Power</h3>
<p>These svelte notebooks are powered up by the newest 8th Gen Intel Whiskey Lake processors and they can support up to 32GB of DDR4 memory and up to 512GB of PCIe solid-state storage. The port selection on these ultrabooks include two USB Type-C ports, a couple of USB 3.1 ports, HDMI 1.4 and mini Ethernet jacks, along with a microSD card reader.</p>
<p>Of course, these high-end notebooks are not left without fingerprint sensors. They also come with Lenovo&#8217;s encrypting data on its dTPM 2.0 chip.</p>
<h3>Camera and Battery</h3>
<p>Here we will again see the Yoga L390 taking the spotlight. It sports a webcam (without ThinkShutter) and an IR camera with Windows Hello compatibility for quick logins.</p>
<p>For the battery, Lenovo has featured both its latest ultrabooks with 45 WHr batteries. Lenovo has promised for the non-convertible L390 to deliver up to 14 hours of battery life and 12 hours for Yoga.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>Both of the sleek and flexy books come in silver and black colors. The laptops are expected to break the shelves this month with prices starting from $659 for a basic Lenovo ThinkPad L390 and $889 for the ThinkPad L390 Yoga.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when Samsung unveiled their Chromebook Plus V2 in June earlier this year? While the device was applauded for its affordability, it just couldn&#8217;t live up to the original Chromebook Plus. Well at least according to some users. Maybe Samsung paralleled with this idea and decided to up their Chromebook Plus V2 game up a bit. Turns out that Samsung, in collaboration with Google, has upgraded this Chromebook model to support 4G LTE.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The Chromebook Plus V2 stepped into the shelves with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera, Intel Celeron 3965Y processor chip &#8211; faster than the <a title="Samsung Chromebook Plus Review – Play Store finally comes to Chromebooks" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/samsung-chromebook-plus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Plus</a>, a  12.2-inch, 1080p display, 4GB RAM, 32GB of solid-state storage, and a 39Wh battery. So you can see that Chromebook Plus V2 was intended to be the upgraded version of the Chromebook Plus. More so, this device is capable enough to be called premium.</span></p>
<p>Samsung deciding to upgrade their already upgraded version seems like they wanted an edge over the <a title="Google Pixel Slate is finally here and here’s our take on the tablet!" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/google-pixel-slate-features-specs-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Pixel Slate</a>. Which according to tech reviewers is the biggest contender of the Chromebook Plus V2 this year.</p>
<div id="attachment_4323" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-image-4323 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-V2-with-LTE.jpg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE" width="561" height="369" /><p id="caption-attachment-4323" class="wp-caption-text">Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 with LTE</p></div>
<p>Josh Newman, general manager of Mobile PC Segments, Intel Client Computing Group, said in a statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Samsung’s new Chromebook Plus V2 (LTE) device meets this expectation with style by fusing Samsung design ingenuity and Google’s beloved OS with Intel processors and Intel LTE connectivity.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>What does the 4G LTE do?</h3>
<p>For all you folks who don&#8217;t really grasp the idea of 4G LTE, let me break it down for you. It allows you to stay connected to the internet even if you don&#8217;t have a Wi-Fi connection. The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE or the Chromebook Plus V2 on-the-go is a dream for remote workers and travelers.</p>
<p>A sharp HD display with 300 nits max brightness, an energy-efficient processor, 360-degree hinge, and a stylus with an added 4G LTE feature sound too good to be true. It&#8217;s not all fun and games though. The connectivity feature addition adds a $100 cost to the overall price too. Not quite affordable but wouldn&#8217;t be called too steep either.</p>
<p>The Chromebook Plus V2 LTE be available for $599 when it launches on November 2 at Verizon and Best Buy. Samsung hasn&#8217;t yet revealed which networks this device will supporting but we have good hopes.</p>
<p>Given that the Google Pixel comes with the same price as this 2-in-1 convertible notebook but minus the 4G LTE feature, might not work in Pixel&#8217;s favor. Or maybe the Google Pixel Slate&#8217;s innovative design and sleeker body be enough for Chrome OS lovers to choose it over LTE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP refers the latest unveiling of HP Spectre Folio as embracing the art of &#8220;manu<i>craft</i>uring&#8221;. The idea behind HP&#8217;s latest grandeur was to make <em>using laptops</em> more &#8216;comfortable&#8217;. They have emphasized towards its correspondence to a PC. Whether it be the look and feel, the <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portability</a> or the specs. Although it sounds quite customary, like every other hybrid convertible in the market, but there is a catch. It is encased inside a full grain leather surface.</p>
<p>According to HP, the wide acceptance and success of 2-in-1 convertible notebooks persuaded them to craft this design. Such laptops are usually targeted to fit in specific user domains. The HP Spectre thrives on the idea and can be adjusted into 3 different positions.</p>
<h3>Feel It!</h3>
<p>The motivation to experiment with the frame of the device was driven from the fact that it needs to feel more <em>humane</em>. Considering that your PC is your go-to buddy for your entire day whether you are a student or a working parent. Resting a cold plastic or metallic body on your lap is too outdated, monotonous and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Apart from the “whiff of ozone”, the traditional hard surface designs don’t really have a smell. Smell is more closely associated with the memory than any other sense. HP wanted to get around the fact and make the device feel more personal. Said Stacy Wolff, HP&#8217;s Global Head of Design.</p>
<p>She also mentions that the idea for a leather casing was also inspired by timeless everyday devices like camera and sewing machines. It was intended not just to provide a leather cover where you slid a metal device in, but to make it a part of the device entirely. The leather casing is directly latched to the laptop. There is no metallic body or surface underneath the supple leather casing and no metallic hinge either.</p>
<p>The versatility of the device is also tailored to market to unisex consumers. Giving off a classy and professional feel, the device can go with a bomber jacket as much as with a handbag.</p>
<p>HP has not used the idea of a leather exterior just as a marketing gimmick but has fully embraced it as an integral part of their gadget which is kind of a go big or go home standpoint.</p>
<h3>Carry It!</h3>
<p>With the concept of a leather casing earning HP major points, it is all moot if the gadget lacks the comfort for usage.</p>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio is bendable into 4 different positions. The embedded forty magnets are sturdy enough to fully support the device in any flexible position.</p>
<p>The on ‘top of the lap as a notebook’ position, tilted up for a cinematic aura, the plain flat surface tablet position and of course,  closed as a stylish leather folder.</p>
<p>HP asserts that by only slight one handed movements, the device can be transformed into different positions almost effortlessly. Even on a tilted angle (up to about 135 degrees), the device maintains a sturdy stature during touching and tapping gestures. Moreover, there are no hinges, buttons or locks to fiddle with to set the positions.</p>

<p>The versatility in the positions is aimed to fit the needs to different consumers. Propped up for media playing, flat out for sketching and drawing and the classic lap-top style for typing.</p>
<h3>Accessorize It!</h3>
<p>To spruce things up a bit, you can always compliment the gadget with some classic accessories.</p>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio can be coupled with an <a href="http://tidd.ly/93075c92" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP Tilt pen</a> for <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/">seamless writing and smooth drawing</a>. For orders now, you will be able to avail the stylus with a 15% discount too!</p>
<p>Another add-on can be the <a href="http://tidd.ly/39105365" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP Spectre Rechargeable Mouse</a>. A sleek silver, smooth finish prop that can be synced with up to 4 devices with easy switching. To add another plus besides its sleek finish, the gimmick can last up to 11 weeks on a single charge. Sounds like a perfect companion.</p>
<h3>Pre-Order It!</h3>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio will be available in 2 modern colors;  Cognac Brown and Bordeaux Burgundy.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the HP Spectre Folio have begun from October 1, 2018, at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-spectre-folio-2-in-1-13-3-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-cognac-brown%2F6301872.p%3FskuId%3D6301872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BestBuy.com</a> and <a href="http://tidd.ly/d7902d1b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP.com</a>.</p>
<p>The device is expected to be available in Cognac Brown with an Intel® Core<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> i7 processor and 13.3-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080) IPS WLED backlit touchscreen, from October 29. The laptop will be available in a few different variants in terms of both body and specifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognac Brown with an with Intel’s 8th-gen dual-core Amber Lake Core i5-8200Y processor for a starting price of $1,299.99. It will come with a 1.3GHz base frequency and a 3.9GHz Turbo Boost mode.</li>
<li>Cognac Brown with an Intel’s 8th-gen dual-core Amber Lake Core i7 8500Y processor and LTE for a starting price of $1,499.99. It has a 1.5GHz base frequency and a 4.2GHz Turbo Boost mode.</li>
<li>Bordeaux Burgundy is expected to be available in late December.</li>
<li>The 4K panel option for the HP Spectre Folio is expected to come out late in December.</li>
<li>The stylish HP Spectre Folio Pouch and the HP Spectre Folio Sleeve are to be up for sale at HP.com in November for $49.99 and $69.99 respectively</li>
</ul>
<h3>But should you really buy It?</h3>
<p>Usually, devices targeted to <em>look pretty</em> or to be more specific &#8211; sleek and portable are not taken quite seriously by hardcore techies.</p>
<p>So far, it doesn&#8217;t look to be the same case with HP Spectre Folio. The 400 nits of brightness and a 13-inch, 1920×1080 unit seem pretty decent. Moreover, HP claims for the device to run for 18 to 21 hours on a single charge. This means to go about your entire day without a charger, and then some.</p>
<p>Having admired the interiors of the device, it seems like HP is pushing too hard for the device to be flagged as &#8216;premium&#8217;. HP is clearly experimenting with  Folio and trying to step out of their comfort zone. Sound quite similar to the attempts made by Microsoft to dominate the &#8216;premium laptop&#8217; market that Apple has ruled since forever.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would definitely try it.  Given the versatility of both the interior and exterior of the gadget, seems like a safe bet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has been one of the initial companies to partner with the Google’s Chrome OS project. The laptop manufacturing company is globally renowned to provide value for money laptops in various categories. Likewise, the Chromebook R11 is a unique notebook in the segment of Chrome OS-powered laptops. Unlike, most of the other Chromebooks, the R11 is a convertible laptop, which can be used in various modes thanks to its 360-degree hinges. The versatile and 2-in-1 laptops are becoming increasingly popular among the people these days.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Acer Chromebook R11 is also a convertible laptop stuffed with some interesting set of hardware and specifications, which makes it one of the powerful <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook under $300</a>. It has won various accolades worldwide from common users to the tech community.</p>
<p>The R11 is promised to provide a comfortable user experience, competent performance with its long lasting battery life. But is the Google’s browser-stationed Chrome OS designed to be used with a touchscreen display? Is it powerful enough to handle our everyday essentials? Without further delay, let’s drill down to know how this laptop fares under various use-cases and circumstances.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, here&#8217;s a quick overview of its hardware specifications &#8211;</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are inevitably difficult to be made. Reason? They have to stay inexpensive yet provide good performance and the most difficult part, it has to compete with the market that’s now full of Chromebooks available for dirt cheap prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3310" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11" width="469" height="332" /></p>
<p>The R11 is launched with a base price of under $300 and therefore, it has to deliver a lot for the asking price. As far as the design and built factor are concerned, the R11 comes with an 11.6-inch screen size which is decked out in a very clean and tidy chassis. The laptop comes with a diamond patterned finish from the outside which gives an additional level of grip, making it easy to hold and carry. Although the company (Acer) claims that the outer lid of the laptop is made up of aluminum, we felt that it was feeble and the design wasn’t very solidly built.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 - Lid" width="372" height="260" /></p>
<p>Having that said, the laptop offers great ergonomics, which you hardly get at this price point. The device comes with compact measurements at 11.6 x 8.03 x 0.76 inches which fit well in bags. Moreover, it weighs just about 2.7 pounds, which is yet another add-on.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a 360-degrees hinge, which is the core of its convertible aspect. The laptop flips well and can be used in four different modes.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen HD WideScreen LED-backlit display with a resolution of 1366&#215;768 pixels. The screen comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which now is a standard and common thing we see in most of the laptops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible - Display" width="700" height="507" /></p>
<p>The laptop offers good color gamut and also manages to provide decent viewing angles. However, what made us disappointed is that the laptop’s display is not adequately bright which makes the outdoor usage a bit cumbersome. Even at the brightness set to maximum, the display didn’t felt very bright, which affects the crispness and contrasts of the regular usage. During our benchmarking, the laptop managed to score a mere 225 nits of brightness, which is subpar considering its contenders which manage to score over 300 nits.</p>
<p>When we put the laptop display’s color reproduction to test, we got a decent 74% of sRGB spectrum, which is very well on top of other Chromebooks priced similarly. We also used the device to watch some high-quality movies and other content, to which the display responded well and gave us a decent experience minus the brightness.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C1LK) is stuffed with decent specifications for the asking price. The device is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor paired with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM. The processor, however, can be throttled up to 2.08GHz through the Intel’s Burst technology.</p>

<p>The display as mentioned above is an 11.6-inch HD display, which comes with a 10-point multi-touch support. Storage segment on the device is backed by a 32GB of solid-state drive internal storage which is very less and that&#8217;s the problem with every Chromebook these days. Thankfully, like most others, the Acer Chromebook R11 also comes with an SD card slot to add more storage.<br />

<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script></p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with one USB 3.0 port for faster, better, and reliable data transfers and comes with another USB 2.0 port to add on an additional peripheral. The R11 also houses one HDMI Port, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a charging port.</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-image-3315 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible Laptop" width="650" height="398" /><p id="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Chromebook R 11 offers USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card Slot and 3.5mm Audio Jack</strong></em></p></div>
<p>For the connectivity, the Acer Chromebook R11 is packed with the latest MIMO 802.11ac wireless technology to support smooth, reliable, and interruption free internet browsing experience. It comes with Dual-Band support to house both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with ease.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with a 720p HD front-facing webcam. The camera like most of the other laptops doesn’t offer any fancy stuff here. The camera takes images with noise and doesn’t produce accurate colors. However, it will suffice your occasional Skype or Hangout calls. The images captured looks a bit muffled. However, the image adjusts quickly on the frame.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The R11 doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned, on what OS does the device runs on. It runs on the latest Chrome OS, which is powered by Google. Google also promised, regular updates, to keep the device safe and lag-free. Although there isn’t much to say about the OS, we want our viewers to know that almost all the tasks in the Chromebooks are confined in a web UI, i.e in the browser.</p>
<p>It might be exciting to know that, Google also promised that the Chromebooks, will soon be able to run Android applications. However, as of now, the R11 doesn’t run android applications. We expect Google to roll the compatibility in an iterative process in the near future.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are not as powerful as the other Windows OS based counterparts. However, the devices manage to impress with their sturdy performance. Although the devices come with a moderately powerful set of hardware, it’s the light-weight software of the Chrome OS, which makes the things smooth and easy.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the Acer Chromebook R11 comes with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor and a 4GB of RAM. This set of hardware is powerful enough to house most of our daily essentials. To test this, we used the device extensively and here is what we’ve felt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 - Performance" width="480" height="298" /></p>
<p>The R11 handled almost all the basic tasks with ease. Browsing the internet, watching videos, multimedia usage, and editing documents were smooth and lag free. The device takes considerably negligible boot up time and loads very quickly. The device tends to get slightly heated when throttled to its full potential. However, the heat remains in limit and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to use. Being a Chromebook, users need to keep their expectations in check. That said, a Chromebook is far from <a title="Top 8 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a>, and other heavy graphic-demanding applications.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the R11 is neat and sturdy and feels solid to type on. The trackpad is rightly placed and comes with adequate space for the palm rest while using.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Chromebook we expect the device to handle Chrome browser with ease. Since almost all the tasks in the device are performed in a web interface, we rapidly switched between a dozen tabs in Chrome, to which the device responded really well. We also managed to run a couple of benchmarks to get a lucid view of the performance of the device, and here is what we’ve managed to achieve with the R11. It scored an 8,200 in Octane and close to 5000 on Mozilla Kraken. These benchmarks correspond to the ability to run scripts in the browser and overall performance.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 although can be a decent multimedia companion, but the device isn’t any groundbreaking in the segment. Discredits to its dull display and muffled speaker output, you will have to keep your expectations in check.</p>
<p>The device can play almost all formats of video content with ease and we didn’t face any lag or frame drops. The speakers are considerably loud but however, the sound tends to get crackled at higher volumes.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>During our time with the device, the Chromebook R11 lasted slightly over 10 hours on a single charge. The device is backed by a 3220mAh battery and the battery backup of the Chromebook is what makes it a very worthy contender in the segment. The device gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in about 2 hours, and stays juiced up to handle all your essentials.</p>
<p>All that said, Battery backup is undeniably a very strong aspect of the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Touchscreen Laptop" width="450" height="344" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg 450w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-300x229.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Acer Chromebook R11 with impeccable battery life and convertible option makes it a very good buy for the asking price. The touchscreen option, and very neatly recessed keyboard and trackpad make it an easy to use it. However, like with every laptop, it certainly has its own hits and misses. The laptop’s display is dull and the audio output is pretty mediocre.</p>
<p>However, if one is ready to trade off those two aspects with the long-lasting battery backup and stable performance, the Acer Chromebook R11 is certainly a value for money investment. It is also worth considering that most of the other contenders in the price range fall behind the R11 when it comes to performance and versatility that it offers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop had everyone on the edge with the announcement of its launch. The market did go through a bump with its launch and today standards of laptop cum tablets have evolved drastically. Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible is certainly not the best dual tech gadget to possess but it certainly has led the way to such marvellous development.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus is a first of its generation;&nbsp;as this is the first convertible Chromebook ever made by Samsung and there&#8217;s lot more to talk about it.</p>
<p>The one reason for which the&nbsp;new Chromebook line ups from Samsung have became the subject of talks everywhere is, they now support the Google Play Store. So, just like your Android phone or tablet you can download and have access to millions of apps and games with the convenience of keyboard and touchpad.</p>
<p>Well, there are still few problems that we faced&nbsp;with software on our review unit like stuttering of apps and games in fullscreen but we think that it can be fixed with the quick software update. To get more deeper insight on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus&nbsp;go through our full review&nbsp;below.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2475" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Tablet Mode and Stylus" width="590" height="452">The stylus also facilities easier drawing and screenshot capture for future reference. The metal top allows the owner to use it in adverse conditions without wear and tear issues. The Samsung Chromebook Plus also has a USB Port and stylus parking space. The side part of the laptop is used wisely to house the volume and power button. One can easily reach those buttons on side while using&nbsp;this laptop and control the volume.</p>
<p>With the dimensions being 11.04 x 8.72 x 0.55 inches, this laptop is comparably on the lighter side when it comes to weight. While all the other laptops are 3.2 lbs or 3 lbs, this amazing laptop is just 2.4lbs heavy. The lightweight model and long battery life allows people to take it along into the woods and enjoy their outings like never before.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Display of Samsung Chromebook Plus is something that puts it ahead of all the popular modern day laptops. The facility to move the screen and adjust according to your viewing angle is like a gift to mankind. Now people can enjoy the best of movies by moving into their beds or by reclining on a comfortable couch. The moving screen also facilitates conversion of the laptop into a tablet. The tablet view is very much idle for surfing and reading; one can finally capture screenshots and also bookmark quotes only to revisit them later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2476" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Display-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus - Display" width="600" height="400">The LED-Lit screen with a resolution of 2400X1600 pixels is not so good for a laptop but highly impressive from a tablet’s point of view.

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop has been in news for a long time now, the quality display and the impressive design had people in awe but what about the technical specifications? Are they equally worthy of praises?</p>
<p>This laptop comes with an ARM-based OPI processor, well a lot of you might be thinking, it does not have an <a title="Find best Intel processor laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel processor</a>, must not be good, then let me tell you, ARM based processors work best with the Android Applications. Since Samsung Chromebook is based on Chrome OS and not Windows, ARM-based OPI Processors are the best. These processors are going to facilitate a greater run for applications and also provide eloquent streaming of high-quality videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>While the processor is really good with HD videos, it seems to skip a few frames when processing a 4K video. The Pro version is supposed to have covered such petty issues.</p>
<p>The 4GB of RAM is good enough to power a processor with speed of 2 GHz, one can easily brag about their tablet cum laptop possessing such high processing power.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2477" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Touch-Laptop-Stand-Mode-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop Stand Mode" width="600" height="439">32GB of Flash Storage is something that is going to upset a lot of people and affect their final decision. The storage provided is extremely low in comparison to what other laptops come with but then one can consider 32GB of Flash Storage good enough for a tablet. Also, it is facilitated with the microSD card slot so there&#8217;s always an option to expand the memory.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible has a processor count of 6, which makes it easier for people to launch a good number of apps simultaneously. Designed to support multitasking this chromebook&nbsp;will see people accomplishing a lot of work at the same time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h4>Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>With the fastest Bluetooth 4.0 this laptop is designed to send and receive signals at a better speed. 802.11 Wi-Fi is good enough to facilitate easier connection establishment and faster web browsing.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this laptop can process some of the toughest files with great ease. The 4GB of RAM, processor with a speed of 2GHz are designed to process all kind of requests and file quite efficiently. Thanks to the efficient set of hardware for a lightweight OS like Chrome, the Samsung Chromebook Plus provides impeccable performance without much stutter or lag.</p>
<div id="attachment_2478" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Touch-Laptop-Size-1.jpeg" alt="Think Light and Convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus" width="428" height="445"><p id="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>0.51&#8243; Thickness &nbsp;| &nbsp;2.38lbs weight</strong></p></div>
<p>The processor provided with the laptop can house all the sufficient power needed to run most of the applications you throw at it. Moreover, thanks to the browser-based interface of the laptop, multitasking on the laptop is pretty smooth and does the tasks efficiently. In addition to all this said, this convertible laptop remains very quiet even under heavy usage, which is very consoling considering the price, form-factor, and performance of this laptop. The laptop sometimes tend to get slightly warmed up under heavy usage, but we’d like to inform you guys that its just near to negligible. All in all, the Samsung Chromebook Plus offers good overall performance at the budget.</p>
<h4>Touchscreen &amp; Stylus</h4>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2479 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Drawing-with-Samsung-Pen-1.jpeg" alt="Drawing with Samsung Pen" width="650" height="381">The input features provided with this laptop are exceptional, one can use the touchscreen to make the drawings more detailed and videos more intricate. The stylus facilitates easier selection, bookmarking and also screen capturing. The stylus on Samsung phones are already impressive and we are glad that&nbsp;they included the same stylus with same functionalities on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus as well. The touchscreen display on this chromebook is also&nbsp;pressure sensitive so this chromebook can really do wonders with&nbsp;photo editing and graphics designing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to check: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Photo Editing &#8211; Our Top 10 Picks</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Operating System</h3>
<p>This laptop makes an exception with the operating system. Not functioning on Windows just like the other contemporaries, this laptop runs on Chrome Operating System, which makes it easier for people to run all the applications they have on their phones on this gadget as well. Chrome OS is going to lead the innovation in this sector, enterprises from all faces of life are now going to concentrate on innovation and come up with really smart and newer versions of operating system.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With the dedicated integrated graphic card, 4GB of RAM and 2 GHz processor speed, users can run all the games they play on their mobile devices. The Chrome OS supports Google Play Stores and all the applications listed on this store. The experience is going to be amazing for everyone who loves games from Google Play Store. One can make the wise use of 4GB of RAM and experience the output.</p>
<p>However, we’d like to add a point here, although the laptop is powerful enough to handle light-weighted games, a Chromebook isn&#8217;t meant for real-time gaming. That said, you could always play internet based flash games or normal arcade games available on Play Store with ease, but games like Asphalt 4 still&nbsp;struggles to run smoothly on this laptop. We think Google still needs to refine Chrome OS a bit for more smoother gaming on Chromebooks.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The audio and video impresses the masses because it supports the varied file formats of audio and video. For its audio performance, we tried playing some high-quality encoded audio Flacs and the laptop to our surprise was handling them with ease. The sound quality was good and decent and was loud enough to cover an entire small room. For the video quality, we tried playing some HD, Full HD, and 4K video content, which also responded really well. The colours reproduced on the screen were accurate and were true to life. All in all, the Samsung&nbsp;Chromebook Plus is also a very good multimedia-stationed convertible device.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life of Samsung Chromebook Plus is quite exceptional, only a handful of laptops provide above 10 hours of&nbsp;battery backup while none of the tablets do. This Laptop cum tablet can stay juiced up to 11 continuous hours so that you never have to worry about carrying your charger again.&nbsp;Apart from that, this chromebook &nbsp;gets fully charged in slightly over 2 hours, which is again a strong point of this laptop. The beauty of Chrome OS based laptops is that, the OS used here is pretty light weight and doesn&#8217;t consume much of the hardware or resources to get the work done, this way, the battery life remains exceptional under everyday usage.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2480" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Laptop-Bottom-Line-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop Review" width="708" height="472">Samsung Chromebook Plus convertible laptop is the undisputed winner when it comes to providing people with an incomparable user experience. The quality audio, video, processing power, long battery life and light weight body are just other reasons why you should bet your money on this laptop. The only thing disappointing about this laptop is the storage space. The 32GB of Flash storage will restrict people from storing their favourite movies and enjoy them when either travelling or stuck at workplace with nothing to do.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design and built quality of the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, the notebook comes with <strong>grey matte finished chassis</strong>. The laptop resembles most of the other laptops in the segment and is recessed inside a plastic chassis. On the top, the laptop comes with a gunmetal grey slab with Dell’s logo recessed in the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2302" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-image-2302 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-13-5000-2-in-1-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378 13 5000 2 in 1 Laptop - Design" width="600" height="404" /><p id="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop (Gun Metal Color)</strong></p></div>
<p>It sports a 13.3-inch display and comes with a <strong>backlit enabled chuckle keyboard</strong>, which is very well designed for all forms of usage. The trackpad is also very well placed and is comfortable to use. On the either sides of the laptop, you have one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a charging slot. Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with dimensions of 325 x 224 x 20.4mm, which makes it a slim offering in the segment. Also, the laptop <strong>weighs just 3.4 pounds</strong>, making it a perfect portable and easy to carry around laptop, which is <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students – Pro Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most suited for college students</a>, business men or anyone who wants powerful and lightweight laptop for their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2303" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-image-2303 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Different-Modes.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Different Modes" width="700" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1. Tent Mode | 2. Stand Mode | 3. Tablet Mode</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, getting deeper into the convertibility and ergonomics of this laptop, it comes with an innovative <strong>360-degree hinge</strong>, which adds on to the versatility and comfort of usage. The laptop allows you to switch easily between four different modes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tent mode</span> is perfect for using recipes in real time, this mode is also perfect for video calling your friends and family while working on something. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand mode</span> of this convertible notebook is meant for movies on the go. The typical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop mode</span> is meant for most of your routine work that you&#8217;d do from your laptops such as <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on word documents</a>, writing emails, and more.  Finally, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tablet mode</span> makes reading easy while you’re leant or reclined.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop sports a <strong>13.3-inch Full HD display</strong>, which comes with a new design emphasised on more screen and less bezel. This not only gives a larger display but also provides a wide-angle display. The display panel on the device is a TrueLife LED-backlit touch display, which provides a brilliant wide-angle view. The laptop’s screen comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving it a sharper image quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-image-2305 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-convertible-display.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 convertible laptop - display" width="800" height="553" /><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>13.3 Inch Full HD Touchscreen Display with 1920 x 1080 Resolution</strong></p></div>
<p>The laptop’s display is not the brightest you get in the segment, and we felt that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was quite dull</span>. The laptop’s sunlight legibility isn&#8217;t the best, and the blacks on the display weren&#8217;t accurate as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre. All in all, the laptop’s display is surely a worth considering drawback of the notebook. However, its touchscreen functionality works absolutely fine in almost all the use cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as aforementioned offers a good set of specifications and hardware for the asking price.</p>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, speaking about the actual innards of this laptop, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with a handsome set of hardware and features. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, the processor can achieve a clock speed of 3.10GHz, which makes it very easy for the device to handle heavy games and apps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i5 Processors (New 2017 Kaby Lake Laptops)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive <strong>1TB of hard disk with 5400RPM</strong>, which is another attractive feature for the price segment it comes under. It also houses Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor to handle all the graphic related content.</p>
<p><em>Like most of the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small convertible laptops</a>, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop also <strong>doesn&#8217;t house a CD/DVD drive</strong> with it.</em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Dell Inspiron i5378 sports a 720p camera, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. Although the images captured using the laptop’s webcam are kind of grainy, the video calls made are serviceable. The colour reproduction is accurate and a camera does manage to capture a lot of details in the images.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the laptop’s <strong>webcam uses infrared technology to bolster facial recognition</strong>. It&#8217;s actually very hard to find facial recognition in laptops at this price range, which is again a very good aspect of the laptop.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Like all other Dell Inspiron 5000 series of laptops, the 2-in-1 i5378 also comes with a good set of ports to support additional peripheral devices and to make the most of a laptop. Speaking of the ports, the laptop houses <strong>one USB 2.0 port</strong> for your regular usage, <strong>two USB 3.0 ports</strong> for enhanced data transfers and added functionalities when you connect any peripherals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY - Ports and Slots" width="519" height="334" />The laptop also houses a full sized <strong>HDMI port</strong> to connect to any display devices. As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Dell Inspiron also houses a <strong>Micro-SD card reader</strong> slot to connect with an SD card. We would have loved the USB Type-C port and we hope that Dell will include it, may be in their next generation 5000 series convertibles?</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY runs <strong>Windows 10 64-bit Home</strong> variant right out-of-the-box. Windows 10 is absolutely the most productive OS in the contemporary world and evidently, doesn&#8217;t need an introduction in the field of laptops. It is not just productive but is also the most common, easy-to-use, reliable, and an OS with the highest number of compatible apps for laptops.</p>
<p>Like all the latest Inspiron laptops, the current laptop also comes with a set of useful apps, readily installed with the laptop. These includes <em>Dell’s SupportAssist</em> app, which is a fairly useful app to provide the right tech support in case of troubleshooting. The <em>Dell Update</em> app makes sure the laptop runs on the latest OS and has all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the other apps which come preloaded with the laptop, there is some <a title="Software bloat - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloatware</a> includes such as DropBox, Royal Revolt 2, Facebook, Netflix, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Twitter, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, and Houzz. Some of them are useful but others can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>laptop comes with a one-year warranty</strong></span>, like most of the other laptops. However, Dell’s after sales support is far better than that of most of the other brands.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to the latest <strong>Kaby Lake (7th Gen)</strong> Intel Core i5-7200U Processor clocked at up to 3.10 GHz, the new Dell Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop runs utterly smooth in almost all the everyday essentials such as handling apps, using for multimedia purposes, gaming, and more. The processor is paired with a good <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which makes the laptop able to handle multitasking with ease. During our review, we tested the laptop with multiple apps running simultaneously, to which the laptop responded really well. Although there was a very minute lag, it was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>For multitasking, we tested the laptop by running benchmarking apps in the background, Google Chrome with up to 15 tabs opened simultaneously, music in the background, and with a constant connectivity to the internet. The laptop was hardly warmed even after 1 hour of such extensive usage session.</p>
<p>During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good <strong>62,482</strong> on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. On Geekbench 4, the laptop scored <strong>6800</strong> which depicts the overall system performance with a stress on graphics reproducibility. These numbers are pretty impressive for a <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops in $500 - $600 Price Range" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop priced just little above $500</a>.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics bolstered by the <strong>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor</strong>. Although the laptop does have a decent set of specifications, it is not meant for extensive and heavy gaming with high graphics and is, therefore, not a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily gaming stationed laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Although the laptop is not meant to handle heavy games such as GTA V, Battlefield, or the DEUS EX in their highest graphics mode, most of the games like the Counterstrike, heroes of the Storm, and Shadowman were still pretty much playable when the graphics set to low/medium.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop can although handle games and graphic-intense apps to an extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s not for the people whose primary concern is gaming</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with <strong>two built-in Stereo speakers</strong>, which are powered by MaxxAudio technology, for better all round sound. The speakers do a great job in providing decent audio output and also doesn&#8217;t turtle at the volume set to maximum. We played high-quality FLAC files on this laptop and the output was just as loud and clear as expected.</p>
<div id="attachment_2308" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-image-2308 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop Review" width="600" height="574" /><p id="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>High resolution display and 2-stereo speakers makes playing games and watching movies fun</strong></p></div>
<p>As far as playing videos, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop can handle HD, Full HD, 2K, and 4K videos without an issue</span> and thanks to the wide-angle screen, watching videos and movies on this 2-in-1 convertible is fun and convincing.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5378 2-in-1 is a powerful laptop with a decent set of specifications including a Full HD display. As for the battery life, the laptop stays juiced up by a 3-cell, 42 Whr battery pack. During our review, the laptop lasted for around <strong>6 hours of continuous usage</strong>. The battery backup is not the greatest considering other similar laptops in the segment delivering 8-10 hours of battery backup. The laptop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">takes about 3 hours to get charged</span> from 0 to 100.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1937" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY 13-Inch FHD Laptop" width="550" height="350" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-300x191.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />Dell Inspiron i5378 is definitely a power-packed convertible 2-in-1 laptop, which you can get at this price. The laptop does have few pros and cons, but after an extensive review, we personally feel that the laptop has more advantages and benefits than that of its drawbacks. The <strong>dull display can be overlooked</strong> with its convertible feature. Mediocre battery life can be overlooked by its powerful performance.</p>
<p>All in all, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop</span> is definitely a must buy, if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop to flaunt with looks, portability, and performance.</p>
