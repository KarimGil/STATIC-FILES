<h3>Design</h3>
<p>MSI is not just known for their powerful innards and gaming performance, the devices are globally-reputed for their beautifully crafted aesthetics and design which compliments gamers.</p>
<p>Speaking of our current device, the MSI GL62M 7REX uses the same case and design as most of its predecessors. The only difference being, the laptop is considerably slimmer and light weighed when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<div id="attachment_3376" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-image-3376 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Slim-and-Lightweight-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Slim and Lightweight Gaming Laptop" width="650" height="242" /><p id="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin and Light for Gaming on-the-go</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, the lightweight and portability are achieved on the cost of an optical drive, which the device lacks. The body of the device comes with a matte-finished plastic chassis with a bright red accent on the rear, which goes all the way to the dual fan grilles. The device comes with the dimension 15.1 x 10.2 x 1.1 inches which is pretty much the norm for 15.6-inched laptops.</p>
<p>On an overall note, the design of the device is pretty stylish, compact, slim, and easy to carry. Moreover, the device gives you that perfect mean-for-gaming hue by all the means. With this laptop, the company seems to aim at achieving portability by attaining the slim chassis and at a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thickness of 1.06 inches with weight just over 5.29 pounds</span>, the MSI GL62M 7REX gaming laptop is extremely portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>

<p>The device comes with <strong>94% NTSC color range</strong>, which means, the device is capable of delivering very competent color reproduction which makes this laptop also an <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing â€“ Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent choice for photo editing</a>. Of course, this better color gamut complements the gaming on MSI GL62M 7REX, which we personally experienced and liked. The blacks are punchy and the panel is bright enough even for outdoor usage. We did not feel any fatigue even after using the laptop for prolonged durations, which is an excellent thing to consider for the gaming laptops.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the gaming performance of the laptop, let&#8217;s first speak about its everyday-performance.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3387" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Gaming-Laptop-Performance-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Gaming Laptop - Performance Review" width="650" height="469" /></p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M&#8217;s audio is pumped by the company&#8217;s proprietary <strong>Nahimic 2 technology</strong>. This is an Audio Enhancement tech, which provides powerful audio without compromising on the details. During our review, the audio from the laptop generating was great. Especially, the depths of audio, while playing games made us feel the gaming environment around us. With this laptop, the users can get the most of 3D sound enhancement of the virtual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.1 surround sound</span> while reducing external noise.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, thanks to its bright display and graphics abilities, theÂ laptop can play all formats of video content with ease.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is vital. However, in the case of gaming laptops, battery life cannot be expected to provide any wonders. That said, the MSI GL62M lasted for about 4 hours on our rundown tests, which included continuous heavy usage and multitasking. Although this is pretty much what we get of a gaming laptop, we certainly expected that the battery would last longer at least by an hour. The addition of heat pipes and dual cooling systems might be the reason for the high battery usage.</p>
<p>The laptop takes about two and half hours for it to get completely charged form 0 to 100. Again, if we&#8217;re speaking about this in a gaming laptop&#8217;s perspective, then the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US gaming laptop will satisfy most, if not all.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>On a conclusive note, the laptop at this price is definitely a very decent buy. However, if you&#8217;re not a complete gamer, then we&#8217;d recommend you to switch to another other device in the price range to get a better RAM, and battery backup. All the gamers, need to keep in mind that this device is a mid-range gaming laptop to keep their expectations in check. That said, the laptop still has a lot of amazing specs and features such as a bright display, powerful audio, very sturdy performance, and amazing look and aesthetics.</p>
