But, Acer has again hit the sweet spot in the budget segment and their 2018 Acer Aspire E 15 notebook offers all the current generation hardware with the steeped down price tag of just $379!</p>
<p>But, how is the build quality? And, how does it perform in real world? Let’s drill down to the detailed review of Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) laptop and find out if it really is the best budget laptop of 2018.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Usually, when a 15-inch laptop strikes in your mind, there is already a typical image in everyone’s mind and it is the very first and most common impression users get. However, it is not the same case with the Aspire E 15. The laptop although comes with an old-school design pattern, like most of the other 15-inch laptops, it comes with good ergonomics.</p>
<p>Weighing at 5.27 pounds, the laptop is a tab heavy and bulky. However, thanks to its design and engineering, the weight is very uniformly distributed all across the device, making it easy to carry around.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3869 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Design-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15-inch Laptop - Design &amp; Build Quality" width="550" height="480" /></p>
<p>The laptop looks completely identical to the last year&#8217;s model as its design has been carried forward from its predecessor (<a title="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop Review – A Solid Budget-Friendly Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e15-e5-575-33bm-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E5-575-33BM</a>) which is fine because Acer is providing better specs on this year&#8217;s model by cutting down its designing and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>As far as build quality is concerned, the laptop is built from a high quality poly-carbonate plastic and it is finished in black color and has a textured lid which gives it a rather aging yet professional look. The device comes with almost the standard dimensions in terms of length, width, and height and measures 15.02 x 10.2 x 1.19 inches. The laptop feels sturdy but it does have some amount of keyboard and screen flexes which are acceptable considering the price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the port alignment on the device, you get a DVD drive, a charging port, a USB port, and an audio jack aligned with the right edge of the device. On the left edge, you get a couple of USB ports, an HDMI port, and a LAN port, neatly recessed.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD display. The display panel on the laptop is an LED-backlit one, which offers decent resolution for all the essential everyday uses. It sports a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which also makes it one among the very few laptops offering a Full HD resolution in the segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_3870" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-image-3870 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-Laptop-Display-.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H Laptop Review - Display" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>15.6&#8243; Full HD Display &#8211; Best in Segment</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Although the laptop had a decent color accuracy, the brightness was relatively low at only 175 nits. However, the laptop’s display had punchy blacks and decent contrast levels. Watching quality video content on the laptop will be satisfying but the display’s underwhelming brightness might be a bit of concern for some users. However, considering the price point, the display is definitely serviceable.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 comes with latest and top of the line specifications for the asking price. Under the hood, the device sports an 8th generation Intel Core i3-8130U dual-core processor which is the biggest highlight of this year&#8217;s model. The Coffee Lake Intel Core i3 processor is clocked at 2.2 GHz and under full throttle it can turbo boost up to 3.4GHz. The latest processor also comes with an Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics for better overall graphical performance.</p>

<p>The latest processor on the device is paired with a 6GB of RAM which is 2GB more than the last year&#8217;s model, however it is slower DDR3L RAM and this laptop&#8217;s 4+2 RAM configuration also eats up both of its RAM slots. But the good news is, RAM on the laptop can be upgraded up to whopping 32GB. As far as storage on the device is concerned, it is managed by a slow 5400 RPM 1TB hard drive which can also be replaced easily with an SSD.</p>

<p>The laptop also comes with an 8X DVD Double-Layer RW (M-Disc enabled) drive which can read and write from any CD or a DVD.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The Aspire E 15 comes with a backlit keyboard, which is a very rare scene for a laptop priced under $400. The keyboard provides a very comfortable typing experience and comes with a very sturdy and sharp key. The keys provide very good tactile feedback while using and this definitely adds on to the great typing experience. On our typing tests, I hit a rate of 72 words per minute, which is great. One should have absolutely no issues in using this laptop’s keyboard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="750" height="445" /></p>

<p>The touchpad on the device is also very neatly recessed and is very spacious. It does the job adequately well and it comes with both the left and right clickers, like the usual touchpad on a keyboard.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with an abundant number of ports and other connectivity options, which makes the laptop stand out in the segment. It sports 1 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x USB Type-C port, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, an audio jack, and an SD card reader slot.</p>

<p>On top of this, the device also comes with a VGA and a DVD writer for the ease of usage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with an HD webcam which sports a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The webcam on the device also supports High Dynamic Range, for better imaging and rendering during a video call or telephony. However, the camera isn’t that great when it comes to capturing some still photographs. The image tends to get a little smoothened and blurred out, losing out on a lot of details in the image. The sensor is, however, fast enough to render the image and adjust it on the screen quickly. Having said that all, the camera on the device serves the cause.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer has always been an exceptionally good multipurpose laptop manufacturer. Accordingly, their Aspire E 15 notebook comes equipped with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two built-in stereo speakers</span> for a surround sound effect. We used the laptop to play heavy music including various genres such as metal, symphony, and mid-focused vocals. The laptop did well and has a powerful sound, which can fill a small room.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the speakers are powered by the company’s proprietary True Harmony sound, which ensures quality audio output with more depth and details. This adds on to the experience while watching movies and playing games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As for watching videos is concerned, the laptop can take it almost any video format at any resolution and play it with ease. We played true 4K content to which the laptop had no struggle playing it whatsoever.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H), being a sub-$400 budget laptop, is still an excellent multimedia performer.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 runs on the latest Windows 10 Operating system, which is confined to the Home variant by default. Apart from housing some of the proprietary applications form the company, the laptop also packs in some additional applications, which we want to term as bloatware.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we personally felt that the laptop comes with slightly more bloatware than that of an ordinary Windows 10 running laptop. Nonetheless, one can easily uninstall the preinstalled apps with ease. The <a title="Acer Laptops Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> come with Acer Recovery management application, which we feel is quite handy, especially if you’re someone who wants to explore more out of your device. Often, people mess up with it and lose their valuable data.</p>
<p>The display of the device comes with two settings, which can be chosen by the user as per their requirements. It comes with a third-party file explorer app known as the ‘App Explorer’, which organizes and sorts the files and folders in the laptop in a slightly better manner. It also comes with CyberLink PowerDVD 14 by default, to run the inbuilt DVD writer.</p>
<p>We faced absolutely no hiccups or hurdles while using the laptop during our review, and the software on the device, never really bothered us despite the bloatware it packs in.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Intel Core i3-8130U processor paired with the 6GB of memory in the Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop provides enough power and speed for productive multitasking on the laptop. During our review, we had multiple multitasking sessions and the laptop did quite well. We even used split screen feature of Windows to play a YouTube video in full HD resolution and running a bunch of benchmarks simultaneously, to which the laptop did quite well, without any lags or stutter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3874" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) 15-inch Laptop Review" width="550" height="530" /></p>
<p>Speaking about our benchmarks, the laptop scored a decent 7,140 on the Geekbench, which gives a pretty much overall performance of the device. This is on par with all the laptops priced under $400. However, the 1TB hard disk drive provided with the laptop had poor read, write and data transfer speeds.</p>
<p>We almost tested out all the connectivity options on the laptop too and it didn’t disappoint us. The device was latching on to the Wi-Fi networks quickly and had a good connectivity range.</p>
<p>As far as the gaming on the device is concerned, considering the price, one should be aware of the fact that, it is not meant for heavy gaming. However, the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics chipset does well for basic gaming. We tested the laptop with some mediocre games such as Dirt 3 racing with graphics set to minimal-medium levels and the laptop did well handling the game and graphics. However, one cannot expect to run heavy games on the device. But what you’re getting in this device at this price range makes it a total steal for the buck.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Our current laptop, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) comes with a 6-cell Li-Ion battery (each 2,800 mAh), which makes it one of the very few devices to come with a 6-cell offering in the segment. Accordingly, the device gives an exceptional battery backup of over 7-8 hours on a continuous usage. Although the company claims that the laptop will give a battery life of over 13 hours, it doesn’t really stand true.</p>
<p>The device takes slightly over 2 hours to charge fully from 0 to 100, which is rather okay for most users. The laptop’s battery life didn’t let us down whatsoever during our usage and this is definitely one of the strong zones of this device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3875" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-best-budget-laptop-of-2018-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 - best budget laptop of 2018 review" width="700" height="320" /></p>
<p>If you’re someone asking us ‘Should I buy this laptop?’, then the answer is ‘YES’ blindfolded. That said, there is undeniably no better competitor for the laptop at this price range, yet. It has powerful innards, offers good performance, lasts long in terms of battery life, and comes with powerful multimedia abilities. What more can you expect from a laptop at this price range?</p>
<p>However, we would have been taken by a storm, if the device had an even brighter display, as that is one of the very few areas, where the laptop falls short.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days, when the terms such as premium, sleek, stylish, and attractive were meant only for the high-end laptops. With almost all the laptop makers understanding the demand for budget-friendly laptops, started to bring their portfolio of laptops at lesser prices to meet the requirements of an audience. This not only paved way for the prices of laptops to come down, but also marked the new standards in even the budget-friendly laptops such as our current Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM laptop.<span id="more-1880"></span></p>
<p>Acer, as always has delivered a solidly performing laptop in the global market. And the best part is that the laptop costs you just around $350. The laptop was launched with a lot of expectations to compete against the already crowded <a title="Our Top Picks of Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under $500 segment</a>. Now looking at the sales and user feedback of the Aspire E15, it is evident that the laptop has certainly stood up to its expectations. It apart from packing in all the latest set of specifications, also comes in a stylish and premium looking chassis, which gives it an edge over its competitors.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the aforementioned aspects and huge response from the users, we decided to have a look at this laptop, and this is what we feel of it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM takes a lot of cues from the previous <a title="Checkout Best Acer Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aspire series of laptops from Acer</a> but has certainly got some improvements in terms of design and ergonomics. The laptop comes with an all-plastic exterior chassis but comes with a minimalistic yet aesthetic design. It comes in an all black colour variant with both matte and shiny finish, as a result of which the laptop gives an industrial feel, which most of the rigid users would aspire to have.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM Laptop - Design" width="793" height="320" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design.jpg 793w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-300x121.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-768x310.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-610x246.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-600x242.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" />Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with the standard sizes as one would expect from a 15.6-inch laptop. It measures, 15.0 x 10.2 x 1.2 inches and weighs around 5.3 pounds. The laptop with that weight feels quite chunky, but thanks to its ergonomics, it feels easy to carry around.</p>

<p>As far as the keyboard and trackpad on the laptop are concerned, we believe that the keyboard is the deal breaker for few here. The laptop comes with a mere 1.6mm of key travel space and an actuation of just 58-gram. As a result, these keys doesn&#8217;t even sound near to perfection and is just passable by productivity-laptop standards. The keyboard is backlit enabled but the numbers on the keyboard can be quite misleading at times. We put the laptop’s keyboard to test on our typing tests on TypingTest.com and I managed to score around 116 words per minute with around seven errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my MacBook Air. The trackpad also disappointed us quite a couple of times, by not taking the gesture inputs properly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1890" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop - Keyboard" width="600" height="351" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard-300x176.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard-515x300.jpg 515w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>On an overall conclusive note on the design of this laptop, it surely is a good looking laptop for the asking price but is slightly heavy with the keyboard and trackpad to blame for.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM features a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a standard resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The laptop’s display comes with a matte finish on top of it, which is quite handy for long-term usage. However, we felt that the display of this laptop was very dull with just average viewing angles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display.png" alt="Acer Aspire E15 (E5-575-33BM) - Display" width="600" height="390" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display-300x195.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Surprisingly, the laptop managed to score a very good, 143 percent in RGB colour ratio with the brightness measured around 190 nits, which is again sub par the segment considering the price. There is nothing much to really appreciate the screen quality on this laptop. On a lighter note, the display is just fine and will satisfy you if you&#8217;re a light user and doesn&#8217;t focus much on the screen detailing. Thankfully, the blacks on the screen were deep and evident.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as mentioned earlier comes with a long list of powerful specifications for the asking price. However, there are tonnes of other laptops out in the market with similar specifications. So what makes the Acer Aspire E15 unique? Well, it’s the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">latest seventh generation (Kabylake) Intel core i3 processor</span>, which is the show stopper for this laptop. Under the hood, the laptop comprises of a 2.4GHz intel i3 processor paired with a decent 4GB of RAM. The amount of RAM ensures decent multitasking on the laptop and is convenient for almost all the daily essentials.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive 1TB of hard disk, which is another outstanding feature in the segment it falls in. The laptop comes with integrated Intel graphics for gaming and other graphics related aspects. Although the laptop is not primarily meant for gaming, the configuration it packs in is enough to run most of the decent games.</p>

<p>The Aspire E5-575-33BM laptop comes with an 8X DVD-Super Multi Double-Layer Drive for data retentions on CD/DVD. Moreover, the drive is enabled with M-DISC, which makes it, even more, easier to transfer content. The laptop also packs in an SD card slot, to read data directly from an SD card.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E15 comes with an HD Webcam supporting a resolution of 1280 x 720 with High Dynamic Range (HDR).</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d like to describe the Acer Aspire E15&#8217;s webcam in two simple words— quite average. Photos taken in bright indoor conditions was decent enough, minus the fuzzy images at times. Thankfully, the colours seemed fairly accurate. The camera is fast and the average time to capture a frame is quite less. All-in-all the camera on the Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM laptop is quite manageable as it is quite enough for casual or professional video calls.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1">Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the available ports on this laptop, it comes with a standard 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 port) for wired network connectivity. The laptop comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C lightning port for direct data transfers through a mobile or faster file transfers. In addition to that, the laptop also comes with a pair of USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port for connecting peripherals or for transferring storage mediums.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1607" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575G-33BM Ports" width="800" height="94" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-300x35.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-768x90.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-610x72.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-600x71.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-50x6.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />For all other entertainment and multimedia based usages, the laptop comes with one HDMI port, with HDCP support.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop runs Windows 10 Home variant out of the box. Windows 10 needs no introduction in the field of laptops and is currently the leading computer OS across the globe. The software is pretty stable and we personally felt that the hardware on the laptop is pretty well configured with the OS. That said, we never felt a lag or any stuttering or hiccups in the software performance of the system.</p>

<p>In addition to all the advantages of Windows 10 such as app supports, Windows app stores, compatibility, productivity, and various others, it also comes with a set of Acer’s proprietary software such as Acer ExaColor, Skype for business and more.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Performance wise, the laptop is top-notch! thanks to the latest hardware packed beneath the hood the Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM delivers a very stable and efficient performance even under continuous usage. It is because of the seventh gen of intel core processors, the laptop is able to provide a reliable performance without getting heated much. Yes, the laptop stays cool even after 6-8 hours of continuous usage.</p>

<p>We used the laptop rigorously to stream Full HD and 4K videos, continuous browsing with around 15 tabs alive in Chrome, run benchmarking applications in the background, and listening to music simultaneously. The laptop to our surprise took all these tasks with ease and was delivering an uninterrupted performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM Laptop Review - Hardware" width="575" height="385" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware.jpg 575w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware-300x201.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware-210x140.jpg 210w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" />As far as connectivity is concerned, we faced no issues in connecting to both wired and wireless networks. Dual-Band on the laptop works very fine and the laptop almost overtime latched onto the network in seconds when enabled. On a conclusive note, the laptop delivers an absolutely powerful performance at the price-point it is available and is surely superior to almost all its competitors in the segment.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, gaming on this laptop is quite ok. That said, since the laptop comes with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, the laptop delivers just average graphics rendering. Although the laptop was able to handle graphics intensive benchmarking applications and flash players with ease, it struggled to handle high-end games such as far cry and fallout 4.</p>

<p>If gaming is your primary requirement then this laptop is not for you. however, you can still play low-to-medium graphics enabled games on this laptop with ease.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM laptop is touted to be one of the multimedia stationed laptop by the brand. I have expected some sort of outstanding performance in multimedia section due to the hype created by the company. Sadly, I was not impressed. Do note that the sound quality is still better than what you get at this price. But, in spite of the two built-in stereo speakers the audio output which we feel is a little low.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with the Acer’s proprietary TrueHarmony to deliver lifelike rich audio along with a custom equaliser. However, the laptop was able to play even 4K and Full HD content with ease. We did not notice any lag or frame drops while playing high-end video content. Watching movies and videos on the laptop will be fun, thanks to its really long lasting battery backup and matte finished display.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with a lithium ion removable 4-cell battery, which I believe is quite sufficient for a laptop this calibre. Accordingly, the laptop was managing to deliver about 8+ hours of battery backup, even after continuous usage. The laptop gets fully charged in 0 to 100 in just around 2 hours, which is great.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1896" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM 15.6 Inch Full HD Laptop - Battery" width="550" height="372" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery-300x203.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />In our video loop test, the laptop lasted for just under 9 hours of continuous playback which is a sign of positivity for all the multimedia enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E15 ticks all the right boxes and is a perfect combination of hardware and software. All the powerful innards and the decent looking outer chassis make this laptop feel and perform better than most of its rival. If you&#8217;re a gaming lover, then probably this laptop is not for you. But let me remind you, if you need a gaming laptop at around $350, then this can be termed as a class-leading gaming performer as well! With all that said, you just can&#8217;t get any other better performing laptop at $330.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever we think of buying a laptop what we usually think of? A good display, light in weight body, powerful hardware, and most importantly we always think of going with a brand that is well established and provides better customer service.</p>
<p>But most of the time some of the things in our list drops off due to our budget, and if our budget is somewhere around $400 then even the hope of getting a good brand shatters leaving all other features behind but what if I tell you that you can get all the above features and much more in a laptop that costs much lesser than $350!</p>
<p>Asus F555LA-AB31 is the laptop I’m referring to here, at $339 you get the entire above mentioned feature and a customer service backing from a trusted brand, Asus.<span id="more-1562"></span></p>

<p>Since its launch in April 2nd 1989 Asus has become world’s 4th largest computer manufacturer in 2015. Asus has been there in providing out of the box products at unbelievable price range and Asus F555LA-AB31 is one such example in the budget notebook range.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Asus F555LA-AB31 looks more elegant than its price range allows. At this price range you usually get a laptop with low quality build and quite nerdy design but with this one the case is different. This device makes it 100% sure that it catches attention of passer bys for no other reason than being an eye candy. Asus F555LA-AB31 is the true example of the quote &#8220;beauty with a brain&#8221;. Asus made a lot of effort in making this laptop’s design as its signature concentric circles and the Asus logo on the lid when hit by light just make the most amazing impression of the laptop in one’s eyes. The laptop’s made up of plastic and in the back it is all plain which would have been more of the cool factor if Asus did something at the back too but it looks just fine this way too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1637" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design.jpg" alt="Asus F555LA Design" width="1122" height="800" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design.jpg 1122w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design-300x214.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design-768x548.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design-610x435.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design-600x428.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-Design-50x36.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" />Coming inside I got my eyes on the silver deck and the faux metal textured palm rest which were just amazing match to the outside lid adding more of the beauty quotient to the laptop.</p>
<p>The display size of the Asus F555LA-AB31 is 15.6 inches and to not make it look left out Asus surrounded it with chunky black bezel texture which looks just amazing while working over it. Now with all the above features anyone would think that the laptop would be just as bulky as any other budget laptop considering its price too, but wait let me tell you that the Asus F555LA-AB31 is one of the lightest <a title="Top 10 Picks of Best Laptops For Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notebook in the price range of $300 &#8211; $400</a> weighing just 4.6 pounds, here Asus made sure that while this notebook sits on your lap you don’t feel like babysitting a rock and made it as light as possible.</p>
<p>Coming over the Keyboard, it is as usual black in texture and offers neat matte covering to the keys but what’s exciting here is that the laptop is ergonomically designed with IceCool technology that keeps the palm rest at a comfort temperature.</p>
<p>Talking about the keys here, they are a bit low point here as they feel a bit bouncy when worked upon but with time this flaw can be overlooked as its not difficult to adapt towards bouncy keys, it would have been difficult if the same would have been hard as rock to press.</p>

<p>For those who spend their most of the time over spreadsheets or document writing tools there is an additional number pad present, the same type of number pad which you get in external keyboards so again here is a plus point of buying this notebook. The touchpad works flawlessly and matches the deck perfectly.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Asus F555LA-AB31 is one of those rare laptops in the market which offer 1920 x 1080p Full HD display at this price range which clearly makes this sharp display its USP. Users usually have to compromise for worst quality displays which are low on resolution and manufacturers cut specs in display only because they know that surviving a low quality display is not everyone’s cup of tea.</p>
<div id="attachment_1641" style="width: 994px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1641" class="size-full wp-image-1641" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode.png" alt="Asus F555LA-AB31 Display Eye Care Mode" width="984" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode.png 984w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode-300x152.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode-768x390.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode-610x310.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode-600x305.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-F555LA-AB31-Display-Eye-Care-Mode-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1641" class="wp-caption-text">Asus F555LA comes with Eye Care Mode which when turned on, reduces level of blue light and makes it easy to work in darker areas.</p></div>
<p>But here you are getting much more than what people get even by spending $500, the display is crisp, sharp and produces vivid quality pictures and its matte coated display takes cares of anti-glare user experience when you are out hitting the sun or are under bright light which usually makes laptops go bananas and to get rid of this we just increase brightness to its fullest which is also very less in some of the present time notebooks. Asus took care of this too; Asus F555LA-AB31’s display is able to produce light at 198 nits which is more than many budget laptops. The display of this laptop scored a Delta-E score of 6.34.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Asus F555LA-AB31 takes care of all your needs here too, while buying a laptop we all take care that the processor should be top notch at least for the price range but most of the budget laptops have the same story of working like they don’t want to and lagging every other second which usually makes the user to stop multitasking and tend to limit his applications so that they don’t cover up much RAM. Taking the entire above thing into consideration Asus inherited this laptop with the powerful 5th generation Intel Core i3 CPU clocked at 2.1 Ghz which makes sure that you don’t have to compromise with your work and to support your multitasking skills there is a 1600MHz DDR3L 4 GB RAM inside the notebook which can be further expanded up to 8GB. The ultimate combo of both the processor and RAM makes sure that your works remains flawless and lag free and also the file transfer rate also remains at par.</p>

<p>Coming over the storage department here the users might get disappointed as the Asus F555LA-AB31 lacks SSD storage which is much faster and secured than the HDD that comes in this laptop but SSDs are usually prone to damage and are low in capacity so it might not disappoint a lot of user base. Talking about the capacity of Asus F555LA-AB31’s hard disk drive, it inherits 500GB of hard drive space for all your valuable documents, photos or any moment you want to be kept in it. If you feel like even this much memory is less for you then don’t worry as it’s an HDD you can always replace it with new one which can be an upgraded HDD. This feature is not available in SSD supporting laptops as they need to buy special SSD for their laptop which are usually high on price and low on capacity.</p>
<p>The graphic card of Asus F555LA-AB31 is another low point for gamers and by gamers I’m not only referring to heavy game players but also those who want to play light weighed older games on this laptop as the integrated Intel HD Graphics 5500 when comes to gaming is only feasible for Solitaire players. The graphic card is weak and for laptop gamers this point is the biggest flaw they’ll ever need to reject a laptop, but if you are not even a light gamer and need a powerful laptop for home or office based work then you may consider buying this as for mediocre net browsing and playing flash files and games this laptop is good.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The integrated webcam in Asus F555LA-AB31 is not a cam that you’ll love to use for business related VoIP meeting over Skype as it fails to create natural looking images and merges colors creating much blurry images than a low quality cell phone would produce.</p>
<p>If you need it for business trips and not to call your grandma over weekends then you might going on hitting your budget up a little bit as at this price range Asus F555LA-AB31 kind of did a fair job in webcam section too as not all budget laptop users consider webcam as a priority.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1644" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ports-on-Asus-F555LA-AB31.png" alt="Ports on Asus F555LA-AB31 Laptop" width="665" height="497" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ports-on-Asus-F555LA-AB31.png 665w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ports-on-Asus-F555LA-AB31-300x224.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ports-on-Asus-F555LA-AB31-610x456.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ports-on-Asus-F555LA-AB31-600x448.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ports-on-Asus-F555LA-AB31-50x37.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" />The ports coming over with this laptop include the power port, an Ethernet jack, a VGA port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.0 ports and a lock slot on the left side whereas the right side comes loaded with the SD card reader, a headphone and mic combo jack, a USB 2.0 port and a CD/DVD drive. Asus didn’t cut off the ports and provided every port that needs to be present on a laptop and that&#8217;s another plus point of this <a title="See More Budget Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/budget-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget laptop</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Asus F555LA-AB31 comes pre packed with Windows 10, the display adjustment utility and the audio software that we will talk about later. The only thing that most of the users will hate is that the laptop comes with bloatware like Twitter and Candy Crush Soda Saga, which come pre-installed; also there is a link to download Flipboard in the Start menu. Although you can uninstall these all but still who wants Candy Crush on their laptop?</p>
<p>As any other Windows pc, this one also comes up with a 1-month trial of Microsoft Office. Asus offers 1 year Accidental Damage Protection with 30 days Zero Bright Dot Guarantee which is one of the most comprehensive coverage available. Asus in this package gives you protection against every possible wrong move you may make including drops, spills and electrical surges while ensuring that your device stay protected. The 24/7 technical support line and 2-way free standard shipping for repairs make sure that in a situation of damage you get your laptop working as soon as possible ready to rock with you again.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Coming over Asus F555LA-AB31’s performance, its 5th generation Intel Core i3 CPU clocked at 2.1 Ghz and the 4GB 1600MHz DDR3L RAM are made to meet out the needs of everyday usability but lacks behind when it to heavy usage and comes nowhere near to the phrase of heavy or even mediocre gaming. While I played my hands over this laptop I didn’t found out any flaw in multitasking or even internet browsing, even with 10 tabs open in Google Chrome, I could easily switch over each tab, however there were some stuttering issues when it played over like a maniac but it’s all because of lesser powerful processor which isn’t made for hardcore usage.</p>
<blockquote><p>For day to day usage <a href="http://amzn.to/2dxF1VT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asus F555LA</a> is one of the best laptops in this price range.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Gaming is not Asus F555LA-AB31’s cup of tea and I won’t comment much over it as there’s nothing to even talk about. You can trying playing older games like Counter Strike 1.6 on this laptop but newer games are not at all playable on this laptop.</p>
<p>The benchmark results of Asus F555LA-AB31 are at the same time poor, scoring only 561 points in 3DMark benchmark this laptop surely puts an Android device to shame but can’t beat a laptop at the same time.</p>

<p>Asus played really a commendable role in controlling how heat is emitted through this laptop as while I used this laptop I didn’t felt like it was heating aggressively, of course there were normal heating present but that’s the problem with every other laptop be it of any range.</p>
<p>The Asus F555LA-AB31 stayed cool under our pressure tests as well and we didn’t notice a bit of extra heat during this test. We have a 95 degree comfort threshold and even after too much of usage the touchpad remained at 77 degrees whereas whole body gone up to just 85 degrees which is far better than most of the notebooks in the market. This clearly shows how Asus’s intelligent heat control technology manages to keep the device cool even under harsh conditions and keeping both the user as well the device from getting hurt.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>We all use computers for different uses but one thing that joins every user on this planet when it comes to computer usage is “multimedia access”. Everyone wants to get entertained and one such way is to listen to your favorite songs or play your favorite movies be it comedy or drama we enjoy it all if the quality of both the screen displaying the movie and the sound emitted by the speakers of our PC are at par and here in the Asus F555LA-AB31 the users are entertained by twin speakers loaded with ICEpower AudioWizard program and to complement the mentioned users get to have Realtek HD Audio Manager which creates some seriously beautiful vibes enough to get your mood driven towards whatever you are listening to or watching and provide you with full on uncompromised entertainment.</p>
<p>You are going to get amazed by the sound quality of the speakers Asus F555LA-AB31 carries. The sound is crispy, loud and clear and even after long hours of usage the speakers work flawlessly without creating any extra unnecessary buzzing sounds that usually every other laptop speaker creates.</p>
<p>I was totally satisfied with the sound quality of the Asus F555LA-AB31 and I’m pretty sure you too will.</p>

<p>The battery life of the Asus F555LA-AB31 is extremely good as it performed commendably outstanding as compared to similarly priced notebooks. I did its battery test and it ended after 5 hours and 44 minutes of Web surfing over Wi-Fi at 100% of brightness.</p>
<p>As compared to other laptops like <a title="See it on Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-Satellite-L55-A5351-15-6-Inch-Laptop/dp/B00F9VPH3U/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Toshiba Satellite L55</a> and the <a title="See it on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2e4bcqP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dell Inspiron i3552</a> that lasted only 5 hours 14 minutes and 5 hours 13 minutes respectively. Overall, Asus F555LA-AB31 did a really great job in battery department among its other contenders.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Asus F555LA-AB31 is no doubt a value for money laptop that provides out of the box features at the price range of $300 &#8211; $400 that one can’t imagine in this segment like the unbelievably clear 1920 x 1080p Full HD display as well as the loud and clear enough to break your old laptop’s heart speakers are a plus point that make you buy this laptop blindfolded.</p>

<p>But for those people who are on a considerably low budget and are looking for a 15-inch notebook for some light browsing, college assignment completion and text editing, the Asus F555LA-AB31 offers a lot for the money you are going to spend and also you get the backing of the world’s 4th largest computer manufacturer.</p>
