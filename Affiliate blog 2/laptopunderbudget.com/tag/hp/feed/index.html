										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is making the move to the red team, releasing two new AMD-Powered HP ProBook models, the 445 G6 and the 455 G6.</p>
<p>Aimed towards small businesses and start-ups alike, both models will feature exclusively Ryzen and Ryzen Pro APUs. But, because the HP ProBook is a business-grade laptop, you&#8217;ll see multiple features that you normally wouldn&#8217;t see in conventional laptops. This includes improved security features, better durability, longer battery life, and an ultra-thin design that&#8217;s all complemented by relatively low asking price.</p>
<h2>The New and Improved AMD-Powered HP ProBook</h2>
<p>For all the flack that AMD has received over the past few years, they have slowly been delivering in the laptop side of things. HP&#8217;s latest decision to arm the HP ProBook should help serve as validation for the once-struggling Intel rival.</p>
<p>Built for the growing business owner, the HP ProBook 445 and 455 will sport a full-aluminum chassis as well as the latest in AMD technology. Both can come with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 2700 APU, which also comes with a Radeon RX Vega 10 GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and plenty of storage with up to a 512GB SSD.</p>
<p>Being that these were made to stand a beating, the newest HP ProBooks passed MIL-STD 810G standard testing and comes equipped with a spill-resistant keyboard.</p>
<p>Finally, at just 0.71-0.75 inches thin, the neat and compact design, paired with its respectable specifications (especially for the price) and batteries rated to last for nearly 12 hours on a single charge, should easily make this business laptop a favorite. Albeit, not for anything remotely close to graphic design. With a screen that emits only over 220 nits of brightness and just over 67 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the display is subpar, to say the least. It also certainly doesn&#8217;t help that the bezels on the screen are a bit thicker.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>HP confirmed that they plan to launch the the sixth-generation of the HP ProBook sometime later in January at a starting price point of $549.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is planning to rule over the education market with their latest Intel-based Chromebook announcements. The HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 and HP Chromebook 11 G7 EE.</p>
<p>HP plans on releasing these notebooks around April which is just the right time for tech vendors to release contrabands for school year buying cycle. Chromebooks being one of the most popular purchases for students and teachers could definitely use an upgrade like this in 2019.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The best laptops for college students of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For instance, the HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 Education Edition is loaded with the latest Intel Celeron processors N4100 or N4000 and Intel UHD Graphics 600. Alongside is its claimed 11.5-hour battery life which if true, is hard to find standup average in budget notebooks. The device is also convertible, and the 360-degree hinge can hold up support in tablet, tent, stand and laptop modes. There is also an optional HP Wacom EMR pen, dual cameras, and support for type, touch, write, capture, and draw gestures as well.</p>
<p>The device also dons a good port selection and contains USB-C ports on each side, a USB 3 Type-A port, a microSD card reader, a Headset jack, 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0. For the storage, HP has equipped this Chromebook with 64 GB eMMC storage and comes with 8GB of RAM for efficient multitasking. Additionally, it comes with a 2-year subscription to 100GB Google Drive which is a nice little bow to seal the package with.</p>
<p>With the same convertibility, port selection and the 11.6-inch screen size as its sibling x360 11 G2, the Chromebook 11 G7 EE is a more traditional take in this lineup. What the 11 G7 EE doesn&#8217;t have is its sibling&#8217;s 5MP world facing camera while both hold a 720p front-facing webcam. However, it does weight lighter &#8211; reaching about 2.9 pounds, as opposed to the 3.2 pounds of the x360 11 G2.</p>
<p>Another feature these both notebooks share is the configuration of processors and RAM, whereas the storage options in the G7 are available from 16GB to 64GB of eMMC 5.0 storage.</p>
<p>But the most impressive upgrade made by HP is shared by both Chromebooks that is the military grade robustness. Not only is it an extremely hard feature to find in budget Chromebooks like these, but it&#8217;s an addition that no one expected to get. The Chromebooks sport a minor-spill-resistant keyboard, shock-absorbing body, and Corning Gorilla Glass protection. It can also withstand a 76-centimeter drop on concrete. We think that HP paid attention to the rough routine that students usually put their laptops through and devised a solution that holds not only powerful internals but also keeps good and strong shape on the outside as well.</p>
<p>HP is yet to reveal the prices of these notebooks which will tell us a lot more about these upgrades, but until then, we can&#8217;t help but hope for it all to be good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest HP Omen 15 means serious business. Unveiled first at CES 2019, HP&#8217;s latest Omen 15 gaming laptop comes equipped with a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display with a <em><strong>240Hz refresh rate and a 4ms latency</strong></em>. This makes it the first-ever gaming laptop released in the world to have such a display. But, of course, HP also made sure that, under the hood, the laptop itself won&#8217;t lag behind its phenomenal screen.</p>
<h3>Hardware Specifications</h3>
<p>The HP Omen 15 will feature an 8th-Gen Intel Core i7-8750H processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and an RTX 2070 Max-Q mobile GPU from NVIDIA. It will also come shipped with modest storage space; the Omen 15 will use a 120GB M.2 SSD as its primary drive and a 1TB 7,200-rpm hard for some extra storage space. Finally, to make the Omen 15 easier to upgrade, HP decided to include a single-access panel at the bottom to make it easier to swap out the hard drive, SSD, and RAM, down the line.</p>
<h3>Design and Weight</h3>
<p>HP decided not to mess much with the design when it comes to the Omen 15.</p>
<p>Sporting the same red-and-black look that consumers have come to associate with their gaming laptops, the Omen 15 should fit quite right in with its predecessors. Even if the exterior is made entirely from plastic, it doesn&#8217;t stop the Omen 15 from exuding a more premium look, albeit one that still has a gamerish aesthetic.</p>
<p>Besides, not everything is plastic. Inside, the Omen 15 has an aluminum interior deck and a backlit keyboard with four zones of customization.</p>
<p>Clocking in at just 5.3 pounds and 14.2 x 10.4 x 1-inch overall, the HP Omen 15 is slightly lighter yet thicker compared to its contemporaries. For comparison, the ASUS ROG GU501 weighs 5.4 pounds but is just 0.7 inches thick. Meanwhile, the Dell G715 weighs 6.3 pounds and is just slightly thinner at 0.9 inches.</p>
<h3>A Display Built Solely for Gaming</h3>
<p>Of course, the most hyped upgrade to the latest HP Omen 15 isn&#8217;t the hardware nor the interior and exterior design. Rather, it&#8217;s the gaming laptop&#8217;s display.</p>
<p>To better cater to the hardcore gamers of today, HP equipped the Omen 15 with a 15.6-inch IPS display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 4ms latency — a massive improvement over the 144Hz display of the previous iteration. In doing so, HP made the Omen 15 the first gaming laptop of its kind on the market.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The new HP Omen 15 will start shipping out to retail stores in February starting at a $1,369 price point. However, these models will come with a different display and a still-unannounced &#8220;NVIDIA Graphics&#8221; mobile GPU. Those who are keen on having the 240Hz version will have to wait until July.</p>
<p>We currently don&#8217;t have pricing for the 240Hz version of the new Omen 15 as of yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has been carrying their Spectre lineup like a shiny trophy since the past year. It has been the company&#8217;s paradigm for experimentation and demonstrating renewals and upgrades in their laptops. Well, the good just got better and the Spectre x360 13-inch and 15-inch both have been bestowed with remarkable features. The Spectre x360 will be departing 2018 with a set of whole new functionalities, an aesthetic design, a powerful battery life, and an improved security.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The exterior is more &#8216;Gorgeous&#8217; than ever</h2>
<p>HP has turned their stunning and artistic Spectre x360 laptops even more eye-pleasing by introducing a &#8216;gem cut&#8217; design. The &#8216;angular&#8217; edges as HP claims are not just there for the looks of it. The Thunderbolt-enabled USB-C port sits on the angled corner for better cable management and the power button is placed on the opposite corner.</p>
<div id="attachment_4445" style="width: 781px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4445" class="wp-image-4445" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rsz_hp-spectre-x360-gemcut.jpg" alt="2018 HP Spectre x360 New Angular Design" width="771" height="515" /><p id="caption-attachment-4445" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>HP Spectre x360&#8217;s New Angular Design | Image &#8211; PCWorld</strong></em></p></div>
<p>On one side of the chassis, you will see a small red switch that controls the web camera and is being called the &#8216;kill switch&#8217;. It can electrically disable the camera by actually removing the driver from Windows. Sound much cooler than taping it up right?</p>
<p>While the 13.3-inch display looks similar to its predecessor model, the bezels have been thinned from all directions but the top, which remains intact. Speaking of what&#8217;s intact, the convertibility is the same as the previous models. The displays flip over into tablet mode or into media mode depending on your preference.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The insides are remodeled for better &#8216;everything&#8217;</h2>
<h4>Spectre x360 15-inch</h4>
<p>The 15-inch model has received this pump majorly because of designers, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photographers</a>, <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops For Programming – A One Stop Shop Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers</a>, illustrators etc. Basically, the professional class users who value nothing more than an improved CPU and GPU performance.</p>
<p>For the RAM option in the 15-inch model, you can go up to 16GB and up to 512GB for SSD storage. The battery life, however, for the 15-inch variant is estimated to hit up to around 17 hours, maintaining a substantial gap from the 13-inch model.</p>
<p>The graphics have been replaced by HP from AMD’s Vega M to Nvidia. So, you would be deciding between Intel&#8217;s latest 8th gen quad-core and six-core processors. Respectively with a Nvidia GeForce MX150, or with a GTX 1050 Ti (Max-Q) option.</p>
<p>The GTX 1050 Ti option is going to be significantly more equipped than the Nvidia GeForce MX150 for gaming or <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video processing</a>. To cool off the machine after doing all the heavy graphics work, HP has added in bigger dual fans and radiators. No matter how impressive, HP Spectre is still not tough enough to compete with the pros like Asus ZenBook Pro 15 or the Dell XPS 15, but for only $1,389 worth of damage, it&#8217;s a more than good enough package.</p>
<h4>Spectre x360 13-inch</h4>
<p>HP is debuting the upgrade by claiming the “world’s longest battery life in a quad-core convertible” for their 13-inch Spectre x360. It means that for an average professional on a 7-hour working day, it can last for almost 3 days on a single charge. Now <em>that</em> is a brave claim to make. Considering that the battery remains the same as from the Spectre x360 (2017) at 60Wh.</p>
<p>HP’s flagship Spectre x360 13 convertible laptops have been recognized multiple times for their core strength and over the top performance. The 2018 update offers a whole lot more with the new Intel “Whiskey Lake” processor and an optional Intel eSIM LTE support. The RAM options go up to 16GB and SSD Storage up to 512GB (NVMe M.2) SSD. You can choose from both a FHD panel or 4K display. And, this decision will directly correspond to the claimed 22.5 hours of battery life. So you can either choose a jock battery with a 1080p display or a 4K screen and less battery life.</p>
<p>The display can be pumped to up to 400 nits, even with the new 1-watt panel technology. So, the new, energy efficient panel has calmed one of the most power-hungry components within a PC. The new display being both bright and color-accurate serves as the perfect eye candy.</p>
<p>If you hate snoopers, you also have the option to equip the device with SureView panel. It will reduce the visibility of your screen to nosy viewers on your left and right, hence preserving your privacy.</p>
<p>The 13-inch laptop is not as graphically gifted as the 15-inch variant and comes with Intel&#8217;s UHD Graphics 620 integrated graphics.  This gives you some room for basic media manipulation and some <a title="Top 8 Best Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light gaming</a> but not as much as <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pros would prefer</a>. But both versions can achieve up to 1-gigabit download speeds of Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Both the HP Spectre x360 13 and 15 will be available in November. You can order them from HP online or Best Buy with the 13-inch variant starting at $1,149.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when we thought HP couldn&#8217;t have made their ZBook line of mobile workstations more powerful, they go on and throw in the 8th generation Intel Core i9 processors in the mix.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s new in the mix?</h3>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long ago when HP bumped up their Zbook lineup. The laptops have now gotten a major boost and will now come built in with the Core i9 hexa core processor, Nvidia Quadro P2000 graphics and of course an increased RAM.</p>
<p>Four of its ZBook PCs: the ZBook Studio and the ZBook Studio x360, along with the ZBook 15 and 17 have received the upgrade. But they are still available with Core i5, Core i7 and Xeon options along with Intel&#8217;s latest innovation processors.</p>
<div id="attachment_4339" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4339" class="wp-image-4339 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HP-ZBook-Studio-x360.jpg" alt="HP ZBook Studio x360" width="700" height="467" /><p id="caption-attachment-4339" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; HP</p></div>
<p>Interestingly enough, HP doesn&#8217;t plan to stop here. The upgraded ZBook models also feature RAID 1 storage. This means that you can now have two solid state drives with the same data mirrored on both. This is a stellar feature for maintaining backups as you can always count on the other one in case the first drive fails.</p>
<p>Moreover, HP has rewarded both ZBook Studio and the ZBook Studio x360 with support for up to a 4K display and up to 32GB of RAM. The bendable x360 convertible model will also be equipped with an anti-glare touchscreen. This addition has made the display even brighter while also cutting down on glare.</p>
<p>HP claims for the improved display to be</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;20 percent brighter than the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch Retina display and 50 percent brighter than the Dell XPS UltraSharp 4K display.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like HP wants to make these two devices outshine in terms of graphics performance and display and market the notebooks&#8217; to better handle heavy workloads such as 3D rendering&#8217;.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <strong>ZBook 15</strong> and <strong>ZBook 17</strong> laptops are getting their RAM upped with up to 128GB now.</p>
<p>According to Xavier Garcia, VP and general manager of Z by HP &#8211; they listened to the needs of creative pros who need to</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;increase their productivity and create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>All four refreshed HP ZBook notebooks are <a href="http://tidd.ly/3fd4d188" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available now</a> on  HP&#8217;s website.  The ZBook 15, 17, and Studio are available starting at $1,349 (the 128GB RAM option available starting from December), while the ZBook Studio x360 causing a slightly more damage with the starting price of $1,499.</p>
<h3>The Z Club Subscription</h3>
<p>For creative professionals, HP has decided to introduce a  hardware subscription program along with a fresh plugin for Adobe Illustrator CC.</p>
<p>The Z Club, will act as what HP calls it &#8220;an exclusive program for elite creators to upgrade their studios.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="no-amazon"><p>A group of 100 creative professionals will be selected as initial members and will be outfitted with custom-made photographer, video editor, graphic designer or artist bundles.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bundle will include not just PCs, but also displays, printers, accessories and applications, which is a banging way to make a first impression with the remodel.</p>
<p>The subscription scheme allows creators to enjoy their bundles for three months free of charge. After the trial period, the subscribers can either choose to pay for the monthly subscription package or send the contraptions back free of charge. HP is yet to reveal the costing specifications of their monthly package.</p>
<p>If you would like to try out your luck and be one of the 100s, subscribe away on <a href="http://tidd.ly/c743f06d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like 2018 is going to leave us with a wave of premium laptop ranges. The stylish<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/"> Surface Pro 6</a> and the leather-wrapped <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/">Spectre Folio </a>and even the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/alienware-m15-first-thin-light-gaming-laptop/">Alienwares </a>were up to take the challenge this time in building the thinnest all-rounder PC ever.</p>
<p>Well, the year still hasn&#8217;t ended and there&#8217;s more to come. Turns out that HP has come up with a sleek design for their Chromebooks as well. Just yesterday, HP has released a trendy upgrade of their Chromebook x2; the Chromebook x360 14.</p>
<h3>Features and Specifications</h3>
<p>I have to say that the by looking at the specifications and architecture of the machine, it is directed towards more advanced users. While lacking the accessibility of a detachable keyboard like its sibling Chromebook x2, the Chromebook x360 14 packs the powerful 8th Gen Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. Not to mention the Advanced Electrodeposition (AED) body to give the chassis a matte ceramic finish along with durability and beauty. The &#8217;14&#8217; apparently denotes the 14-inch display which is a 16:9 1920×1080 IPS panel with pretty slim bezels. Complimenting the laptop&#8217;s overall appearance.</p>
<p>The keyboard &#8211; although not detachable, is fully backlit and the battery can last up to 13.5 hours of on a single charge. The device fashions two USB-C ports and a couple of USB-A ports too. The microSD slot and a headphone jack on the side, it also comes with an “HD Wide Vision” webcam.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Chromebook x360 14 hosts an <span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">8GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM with a </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">64GB eMMC storage. But it&#8217;s still a question whether these more than impressive specs be able to cover up the hole left by the absence of a pen in this device.</span></p>
<p>Another stance that HP is trying to make with the Chromebook x360 14 is that it&#8217;s a luxury device. Comparatively to the Chromebook x360 11 that was aimed more towards students.</p>

<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>The Chromebook x360 15 is up for pre-orders now on HP&#8217;s <a href="http://tidd.ly/b3b1cd15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> and will be available in stores from October 21.</p>
<p>The device will cost you a total damage of $600. Seems like a fair price for a device that sits amongst the Elite notebooks in terms of specs, looks, and durability.</p>
