The company understands the needs of every user covering every niche and accordingly release various laptops with good specifications at the asking price. And when it comes to a laptop for college, whatever may be the need, budget is a strict constraint. A students laptop has to be reliable and must satisfy the budget constraint.</p>
<p>To satisfy the above maxim, Acer introduced its Aspire 1, a 14-inch lightweight Notebook, which is not hard on the pocket but is packed with features, every student would love to have. Sporting a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14-inch Full HD display</span>, this laptop is powered by a dual-core Intel Celeron N4000 processor paired with 4GB of RAM.

It has a 10-inch pixelsense touch display which is smaller than the standard laptops, but it&#8217;s excellent in terms of color reproduction and is very sensitive to touches. It also supports Surface Pen which although costs extra, it makes Surface Go an excellent tablet to take notes in classroom.</p>
<p>The versatile form factor of the Microsoft Surface Go paired with a nice keyboard on its type cover makes working on-the-go and carrying it to different places way more easy than a standard laptop. Therefore, it is one of our most recommended budget laptops under $500 for students of 2019.</p>

<h3>15. Apple MacBook Air 2019 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best MacBook for College</span></h3>

<p>I am pretty sure there are few Mac lovers hiding in the cluster of Windows laptops. For all those students, the 2019 Apple MacBook Air is a very good alternative to all the Windows-based laptops. Styled in an all new anodized aluminum chassis, the MacBook Air is a powerful machine, which is known for its long-lasting battery backup of up to 10 hours. It comes with an Intel Core i5 Y-series dual-core processor paired with an 8GB of RAM. Its lightweight ultra-sleek ergonomics gains it an upper hand over other traditional Windows laptops in the segment. Overall, we think that it is the best MacBook for college you can buy right now. Its design, performance, and battery life is just perfect for student life.</p>

Although it costs more than $1000, it comes with a lot more powerful quad-core Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD.

<blockquote><p>The <strong>Dell XPS 13 2-in-1</strong> is also excellent option for college if you are looking to purchase a premium 2-in-1 laptop. Its price starts from $1000 which is slightly higher than the starting price of the standard XPS 13, but it offers the same nearly borderless 13.3-inch full HD InfinityEdge touchscreen display which can be rotated 360 degrees and premium aluminum chassis. It is powered by the Intel&#8217;s Y-series processor family, which is less powerful than the quad-core chips on standard XPS 13, but it will be enough for everyday college requirements. However, the webcam on the XPS 13 2-in-1 is nose peeking one like older XPS models, but you can rotate the display and use the webcam in tablet mode to avoid that. | <a title="Best Price on Dell" href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-9365-2-in-1-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Dell</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lenovo Thinkpad P1 is our recommendation for the engineering students because of the two main reasons. It is lightweight, and its hardware is certified for CAD work. Meaning, its hardware is optimized to work efficiently with all the major CAD and 3D Modeling softwares such as AutoCAD, SOLIDWORKS, and more. Having said that, ThinkPad P1 is a workstation laptop powered by an ultra-high-end Intel Core i7 processor and Nvidia Quadro P1000 GPU. These are a perfect set of specs for students in architecture and civil engineering majors for doing CAD and 3D Modeling works. Apart from powerful specs, this laptop is also one of the best-built laptops you can buy to work in harsh conditions. You can take notes on this laptop while you&#8217;re in the classroom or take it to the construction sites to perform practicals. Moreover, it weighs less than 4 pounds so taking it to different places is no problem at all, and its battery lasts for up to 10-hours on a single charge which is excellent considering the kind of hardware that it packs inside.</p>
<p>Of-course the laptop with such features and powerful hardware will not come with a cheap price tag. The Lenovo Thinkpad P1 starts from $1,319.00 and is available. Consider this as a one-time investment because it will be perfect even after college for work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is planning to rule over the education market with their latest Intel-based Chromebook announcements. The HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 and HP Chromebook 11 G7 EE.</p>
<p>HP plans on releasing these notebooks around April which is just the right time for tech vendors to release contrabands for school year buying cycle. Chromebooks being one of the most popular purchases for students and teachers could definitely use an upgrade like this in 2019.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The best laptops for college students of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For instance, the HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 Education Edition is loaded with the latest Intel Celeron processors N4100 or N4000 and Intel UHD Graphics 600. Alongside is its claimed 11.5-hour battery life which if true, is hard to find standup average in budget notebooks. The device is also convertible, and the 360-degree hinge can hold up support in tablet, tent, stand and laptop modes. There is also an optional HP Wacom EMR pen, dual cameras, and support for type, touch, write, capture, and draw gestures as well.</p>
<p>The device also dons a good port selection and contains USB-C ports on each side, a USB 3 Type-A port, a microSD card reader, a Headset jack, 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0. For the storage, HP has equipped this Chromebook with 64 GB eMMC storage and comes with 8GB of RAM for efficient multitasking. Additionally, it comes with a 2-year subscription to 100GB Google Drive which is a nice little bow to seal the package with.</p>
<p>With the same convertibility, port selection and the 11.6-inch screen size as its sibling x360 11 G2, the Chromebook 11 G7 EE is a more traditional take in this lineup. What the 11 G7 EE doesn&#8217;t have is its sibling&#8217;s 5MP world facing camera while both hold a 720p front-facing webcam. However, it does weight lighter &#8211; reaching about 2.9 pounds, as opposed to the 3.2 pounds of the x360 11 G2.</p>
<p>Another feature these both notebooks share is the configuration of processors and RAM, whereas the storage options in the G7 are available from 16GB to 64GB of eMMC 5.0 storage.</p>
<p>But the most impressive upgrade made by HP is shared by both Chromebooks that is the military grade robustness. Not only is it an extremely hard feature to find in budget Chromebooks like these, but it&#8217;s an addition that no one expected to get. The Chromebooks sport a minor-spill-resistant keyboard, shock-absorbing body, and Corning Gorilla Glass protection. It can also withstand a 76-centimeter drop on concrete. We think that HP paid attention to the rough routine that students usually put their laptops through and devised a solution that holds not only powerful internals but also keeps good and strong shape on the outside as well.</p>
<p>HP is yet to reveal the prices of these notebooks which will tell us a lot more about these upgrades, but until then, we can&#8217;t help but hope for it all to be good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-exterior-design.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 2018 - exterior design" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Our Most Recommended Portable Laptops</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>

<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Musicians and DJs</a></strong></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4252" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-image-4252 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-9370-2018-battery-test.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 2018 - battery test" width="733" height="550"><p id="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-caption-text">Image by &#8211; forester401 on flickr</p></div>
<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3971 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="955" height="143" /></p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has been one of the initial companies to partner with the Google’s Chrome OS project. The laptop manufacturing company is globally renowned to provide value for money laptops in various categories. Likewise, the Chromebook R11 is a unique notebook in the segment of Chrome OS-powered laptops. Unlike, most of the other Chromebooks, the R11 is a convertible laptop, which can be used in various modes thanks to its 360-degree hinges. The versatile and 2-in-1 laptops are becoming increasingly popular among the people these days.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Acer Chromebook R11 is also a convertible laptop stuffed with some interesting set of hardware and specifications, which makes it one of the powerful <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook under $300</a>. It has won various accolades worldwide from common users to the tech community.</p>
<p>The R11 is promised to provide a comfortable user experience, competent performance with its long lasting battery life. But is the Google’s browser-stationed Chrome OS designed to be used with a touchscreen display? Is it powerful enough to handle our everyday essentials? Without further delay, let’s drill down to know how this laptop fares under various use-cases and circumstances.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, here&#8217;s a quick overview of its hardware specifications &#8211;</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are inevitably difficult to be made. Reason? They have to stay inexpensive yet provide good performance and the most difficult part, it has to compete with the market that’s now full of Chromebooks available for dirt cheap prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3310" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11" width="469" height="332" /></p>
<p>The R11 is launched with a base price of under $300 and therefore, it has to deliver a lot for the asking price. As far as the design and built factor are concerned, the R11 comes with an 11.6-inch screen size which is decked out in a very clean and tidy chassis. The laptop comes with a diamond patterned finish from the outside which gives an additional level of grip, making it easy to hold and carry. Although the company (Acer) claims that the outer lid of the laptop is made up of aluminum, we felt that it was feeble and the design wasn’t very solidly built.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 - Lid" width="372" height="260" /></p>
<p>Having that said, the laptop offers great ergonomics, which you hardly get at this price point. The device comes with compact measurements at 11.6 x 8.03 x 0.76 inches which fit well in bags. Moreover, it weighs just about 2.7 pounds, which is yet another add-on.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a 360-degrees hinge, which is the core of its convertible aspect. The laptop flips well and can be used in four different modes.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen HD WideScreen LED-backlit display with a resolution of 1366&#215;768 pixels. The screen comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which now is a standard and common thing we see in most of the laptops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible - Display" width="700" height="507" /></p>
<p>The laptop offers good color gamut and also manages to provide decent viewing angles. However, what made us disappointed is that the laptop’s display is not adequately bright which makes the outdoor usage a bit cumbersome. Even at the brightness set to maximum, the display didn’t felt very bright, which affects the crispness and contrasts of the regular usage. During our benchmarking, the laptop managed to score a mere 225 nits of brightness, which is subpar considering its contenders which manage to score over 300 nits.</p>
<p>When we put the laptop display’s color reproduction to test, we got a decent 74% of sRGB spectrum, which is very well on top of other Chromebooks priced similarly. We also used the device to watch some high-quality movies and other content, to which the display responded well and gave us a decent experience minus the brightness.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C1LK) is stuffed with decent specifications for the asking price. The device is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor paired with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM. The processor, however, can be throttled up to 2.08GHz through the Intel’s Burst technology.</p>

<p>The display as mentioned above is an 11.6-inch HD display, which comes with a 10-point multi-touch support. Storage segment on the device is backed by a 32GB of solid-state drive internal storage which is very less and that&#8217;s the problem with every Chromebook these days. Thankfully, like most others, the Acer Chromebook R11 also comes with an SD card slot to add more storage.<br />

<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with one USB 3.0 port for faster, better, and reliable data transfers and comes with another USB 2.0 port to add on an additional peripheral. The R11 also houses one HDMI Port, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a charging port.</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-image-3315 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible Laptop" width="650" height="398" /><p id="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Chromebook R 11 offers USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card Slot and 3.5mm Audio Jack</strong></em></p></div>
<p>For the connectivity, the Acer Chromebook R11 is packed with the latest MIMO 802.11ac wireless technology to support smooth, reliable, and interruption free internet browsing experience. It comes with Dual-Band support to house both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with ease.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with a 720p HD front-facing webcam. The camera like most of the other laptops doesn’t offer any fancy stuff here. The camera takes images with noise and doesn’t produce accurate colors. However, it will suffice your occasional Skype or Hangout calls. The images captured looks a bit muffled. However, the image adjusts quickly on the frame.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The R11 doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned, on what OS does the device runs on. It runs on the latest Chrome OS, which is powered by Google. Google also promised, regular updates, to keep the device safe and lag-free. Although there isn’t much to say about the OS, we want our viewers to know that almost all the tasks in the Chromebooks are confined in a web UI, i.e in the browser.</p>
<p>It might be exciting to know that, Google also promised that the Chromebooks, will soon be able to run Android applications. However, as of now, the R11 doesn’t run android applications. We expect Google to roll the compatibility in an iterative process in the near future.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are not as powerful as the other Windows OS based counterparts. However, the devices manage to impress with their sturdy performance. Although the devices come with a moderately powerful set of hardware, it’s the light-weight software of the Chrome OS, which makes the things smooth and easy.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the Acer Chromebook R11 comes with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor and a 4GB of RAM. This set of hardware is powerful enough to house most of our daily essentials. To test this, we used the device extensively and here is what we’ve felt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 - Performance" width="480" height="298" /></p>
<p>The R11 handled almost all the basic tasks with ease. Browsing the internet, watching videos, multimedia usage, and editing documents were smooth and lag free. The device takes considerably negligible boot up time and loads very quickly. The device tends to get slightly heated when throttled to its full potential. However, the heat remains in limit and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to use. Being a Chromebook, users need to keep their expectations in check. That said, a Chromebook is far from <a title="Top 8 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a>, and other heavy graphic-demanding applications.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the R11 is neat and sturdy and feels solid to type on. The trackpad is rightly placed and comes with adequate space for the palm rest while using.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Chromebook we expect the device to handle Chrome browser with ease. Since almost all the tasks in the device are performed in a web interface, we rapidly switched between a dozen tabs in Chrome, to which the device responded really well. We also managed to run a couple of benchmarks to get a lucid view of the performance of the device, and here is what we’ve managed to achieve with the R11. It scored an 8,200 in Octane and close to 5000 on Mozilla Kraken. These benchmarks correspond to the ability to run scripts in the browser and overall performance.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 although can be a decent multimedia companion, but the device isn’t any groundbreaking in the segment. Discredits to its dull display and muffled speaker output, you will have to keep your expectations in check.</p>
<p>The device can play almost all formats of video content with ease and we didn’t face any lag or frame drops. The speakers are considerably loud but however, the sound tends to get crackled at higher volumes.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>During our time with the device, the Chromebook R11 lasted slightly over 10 hours on a single charge. The device is backed by a 3220mAh battery and the battery backup of the Chromebook is what makes it a very worthy contender in the segment. The device gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in about 2 hours, and stays juiced up to handle all your essentials.</p>
<p>All that said, Battery backup is undeniably a very strong aspect of the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Touchscreen Laptop" width="450" height="344" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg 450w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-300x229.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Acer Chromebook R11 with impeccable battery life and convertible option makes it a very good buy for the asking price. The touchscreen option, and very neatly recessed keyboard and trackpad make it an easy to use it. However, like with every laptop, it certainly has its own hits and misses. The laptop’s display is dull and the audio output is pretty mediocre.</p>
<p>However, if one is ready to trade off those two aspects with the long-lasting battery backup and stable performance, the Acer Chromebook R11 is certainly a value for money investment. It is also worth considering that most of the other contenders in the price range fall behind the R11 when it comes to performance and versatility that it offers.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA is a revamped version of the previous VivoBook edition of laptops launched by the company. This time ASUS has been in trend and made its laptops much more elegant, sleek, and stylish. The laptops are also lighter and are marginally thinner than its predecessors and weigh just about 3.7 pounds and come with measurements of 14.2 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches.</p>
<div id="attachment_3097" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-image-3097 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop - Design" width="650" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thinner &amp; Lighter (Just 0.8-inch thick and weighs 3.7 pounds)</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a brushed metal, shiny chassis, in a glittering grey color. The laptop is thicker at the hinge-edge and gradually gets narrower. The design aspects of the VivoBook, we feel, are largely drawn from the likes of the <a title="Check Current Price of MacBook Air on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2hKvugK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple’s MacBook Air</a> externally. The placement of ports, trackpad, keyboard, and other vitals are very similar to the previous generation of VivoBooks, and all in all, the laptop feels quite easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3098 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop Review" width="650" height="386" /></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of this laptop is that it comes with an ultra-narrow 0.3-inch ASUS’ proprietary NanoEdge bezel, which gives an amazing 80% of screen-to-body ratio. The bezels on the laptop are fairly negligible and are probably one of the rarest laptops in the market currently to offer such slim bezel display in a laptop at such low price.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, ASUS VivoBook F510UA makes it feels like you have a full-size 15.6” FHD WideView display embedded into a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a>, which not only makes it compact and sleek to use, but also offers wider, bigger, and much better display. On a final note on the design and build quality, the laptop comes with a uniform solid build quality and certainly is beautiful enough to attract the masses.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LED display which is vibrant. As far as the resolution of the display is concerned, it comes with a Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. As mentioned earlier, the laptop’s WideView makes it look even better, and thanks to its larger display, the viewing angles on this machine are perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_3099" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-image-3099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop - Display Review" width="800" height="445" /><p id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also comes with the ASUS’ proprietary Splendid visual optimization technology, which automatically provides the optimized visuals to the user for almost any kind of content being played. The laptop comes with custom features as well as pre-installed display modes such as Normal, Vivid, Eye-Care, and Manual, which can be accessed and enabled based on the user’s choice. The videos on the screen also turn out to be a visual treat all thanks to the ASUS Tru2Life Video technology which enhances the movie watching experience on this laptop. The display on this device comes with an intelligent set of sensors which optimises the essential visual parameters such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and hue in every pixel to produce vivid and lively imagery.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA laptop offers a robust set of innards and is undeniably a powerful device on the paper. Let’s have a quick glance at what does the laptop offers. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the latest and the most advanced, 8th Generation of Intel Core i5-8250U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 1.6GHz which can, however, rattle up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Laptops with Intel Core i5 8th Gen Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Multitasking and the applications on the device are handled by an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage department on the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of HDD, which is although ample amount of storage, still lags behind SSD when it comes to data transfer speeds and efficiency. We hoped that the laptop comes with an SSD storage, this could have been a deadly combination for a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $500</a>. The laptop comes with an integrated graphics coprocessor and doesn’t come with any additional GPU.</p>
<p>VivoBook also comes with a fingerprint sensor to add a layer of security to the device and the data in it. This is certainly one of the rare finds in a laptop priced at this range.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the hardware is concerned, the laptop&#8217;s RAM can be upgraded up to 16GB, and its hard drive is also swappable with solid state drive. So, overall ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is a future-proof device which not only provides all current generation hardware specifications but also ensures that it stays up to date with time.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The VivoBook comes with a VGA front-facing camera, and like most of the other laptops in the segment, the front camera on the device is just serviceable. It can capture decent images in daylight conditions and fails to add details under low-light. The image rendering of the device’s camera is quick and is able enough to capture fleeting moments during a video call. There’s nothing exceptional about the webcam on this laptop, and at the same time, do note that there’s nothing to complain as well.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the ports and connectivity options on the VivoBook, it comes with a standard set of ports, which is more or less a common practice in most of the laptops. All the ports are uniformly distributed along the two sides of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Ports and Slots" width="800" height="370" /></p>
<p>The device comes with one USB 3.1 and one USB 3.0 port, for faster, reliable, and efficient data transfers. And, comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports for adding up additional peripherals. It also houses an HDMI, 3.5mm Audio Jack, and an SD card reader.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop comes with Windows 10 Home variant pre-installed. Windows 10, which is world&#8217;s most used computer operating system, needs no introduction of what it’s capable of. The laptop doesn’t come with any much of the bloatware and is, therefore, fast, efficient, and nag-free. The device, however, does come pre-installed with some of the productive aspects and tools, which ought to increase the overall productivity of the system.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to its powerful and most importantly, the latest set of hardware and innards, the VivoBook offers excellent performance for the budget. No matter how strong the specifications are on paper, what actually matters is its real-time usage and performance. And during our usage and hands-on with this sleek and stylish looking laptop, we were satisfied with its overall performance.</p>
<p>The laptop stays quiet and offers decent graphic-based tasks performance. That said, as the laptop doesn’t come with a specific dedicated graphics coprocessor, the gaming on the device might not cater hardcore gamers. However, thankfully, it can handle small to mediocre demanding games quite well, thanks to the Intel&#8217;s integrated UHD 620 graphics.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Multimedia stands as a common stop for all sorts of laptop users. Be it gamers, businessmen, students, regular home purpose, no matter what the need is, a laptop will undeniably be used as a source of multimedia.</p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA comes with Two Built-in Stereo Speakers which provides very powerful and thumping audio output. During our review, we tested the speakers with bass heavy, punchy tracks, accustomed mids, and also treble stationed lean tracks. And to our surprise, the sound was pretty clear on all the occasions.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, it can handle almost all forms of videos and codecs. 4K and Full HD videos were playing absolutely lag-free and thanks to its wide viewing angles, we actually had a good time watching content on this laptop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Battery Life</span></p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA was one among the very first laptop we tested, which came along with the 8th Gen Intel core processors and we must say, the chipsets are very power efficient and robust. The laptop offers decent battery backup and is probably way ahead of most of its rivals in the segment.</p>
<p>On a single charge, the laptop stays juiced up for about 5-6 hours of continuous usage. It takes just over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. The battery type on this laptop is a Li-Ion one, and our final comments on the battery life would be <em>&#8216;The laptop did not fail us in terms of battery life,&#8217;</em> while most others in this price range don&#8217;t provide this good specs and battery life for the price!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2960 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Not every laptop in the market comes with the latest 8th Gen Intel core processors and decent battery life. Even if they do, they will certainly not look as polished and solid as the ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop. Moreover, the price point of $500 makes this laptop an unarguably one of the better offerings you can get currently in the market. Provided, you are not looking for a gaming-stationed laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes in a polycarbonate chassis and is cladded in a charcoal-grey exterior. The laptop comes with a brushed metal finish, which adds to the premium factor for the laptop. It is thin, compact, portable, and comes with a beautiful tactile finish. Thanks to its texture and form-factor, the laptop offers good grip to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3052 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-14-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14 Inch Laptop - Design" width="650" height="324" /></p>
<p>The laptop weighs just around 3.6 pounds and measures 13.5 x 9.65 x 0.71 inches, which is now a standard for these <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inchers</a>. The screen is surrounded by thick bezels in a matte-black bezel, and rubber cladding covering all sides. All the ports and connectors are neatly recessed at either side of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop features a 180-degree hinge, so the keyboard and screen can lay flat together. This feature makes it an ideal choice for a group of kids to huddle around a desk and allows the users to adjust the screen to whatever level, they are most comfortable with.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3053 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop Keyboard" width="600" height="375" /></p>
<p>On a conclusive note about the design and finish of the Aspire 1, although the laptop doesn’t offer a lot of fancy flairs, it certainly ticks all the design essentials including built quality, finish, grip, and portability.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2017 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Laptops for College Students of 2017</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 14-inch Full HD display, which is a rare scene for a <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $300</a>. It comes with a widescreen display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Considering the specifications, the laptop is unarguably a great bargain for the price. Now let’s speak about its real-time performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3054 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Full-HD-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Full HD Display" width="800" height="596" /></p>
<p>The device comes with a very crisp and sharp display panel, which offers adequate colors with precision. During our review, we extensively used the laptop to watch high definition content and 4K content. When I viewed the aforementioned content, I noticed that although the blacks on the screen were slightly dull and less punchy, it was able to reproduce good color gamut, which we hardly see in a laptop at this price.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Although the design is one of the strong points of the Acer Aspire 1, the hardware and specifications are yet another unique selling point of this laptop. It sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-Core Processor which can throttle up to 2.2GHz. The processor is paired with a 4GB of RAM to handle multitasking and applications on the device. The device comes with a mere 32GB of onboard storage, which <strong>cannot</strong> be, however, further expanded by putting a bigger SSD or HDD.</p>
<p>Graphics on the laptop are handled by the CPU&#8217;s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU, which although isn’t meant to handle high-end games, can still take on moderate graphics with ease. Other specifications of the device include connectivity options such as 802.11ac WiFi featuring MIMO technology. It also sports a dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz to boost up the connectivity speeds.</p>
<p>Considering the price point at which the laptop is being sold, trading-off with some hardware feels absolutely fine. As long as your expectations are in check, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop will not disappoint you.<br />

<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop comes with a VGA front facing webcam, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. The maximum resolution of the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 is 640&#215;480  pixels. The images captured on the camera felt slightly underwhelming and turned out grainy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2875 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Acer-Aspire-1-14-inch-full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14-inch full HD Laptop" width="550" height="312" /></p>
<p>The video calls on the laptop were serviceable. On a conclusive note, the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 doesn’t come with anything worth mentioning but it certainly does the basics well.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 offers a long list of connectivity options and ports. All the ports and connectivity slots on this laptop are equally distributed on its either sides. Accordingly, it sports 1 USB 3.0 Port, a HDMI port with HDCP support, and an SD card reader on its left edge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3056 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Ports and Slots" width="1000" height="307" /></p>
<p>Whereas the right corner of the laptop contains 2 USB 2.0 ports and a 3.5mm Audio Jack.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer preloads the Aspire 1 with the Windows 10 Home variant and with just a handful of utilities that makes the laptop free from unnecessary bloatware. The laptop also comes with some of the Acer’s proprietary software and tools including the Acer Care Center, which monitors the system health and provides the information about the software updates.</p>
<p>Like in most of the latest Acer laptops, The Aspire 1’s Power Button comes with a customisable option to perform multiple options. And all these options can be customised and easily set through the Windows 10 control panel. Speaking about the Acer Quick Access, the software allows you to quickly enable or disable the blue light-reduction mode and aids in setting up a quick hotspot.</p>
<p>Apart from them, the laptop comes with a standard load of casual games, tools, and trialware. On a conclusive note, the laptop does offer a sturdy and well-rounded software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Top 10 Best Laptops Under $200</strong></em></a></div></div>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 as mentioned above comes with a decent set of specifications. However, specifications alone cannot predict the regular daily usage. The laptop takes about 10-12 seconds to boot the Windows 10, which is rather slow. All the apps take a while to load and heavy applications such as the Chrome might take another 5-10 seconds to show up. Thankfully, the RAM management on the device seems to work just fine and multi-tasking was good and smooth.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, we pushed it to its complete throttle and threw a hard set of applications and requests simultaneously. The laptop to our surprise did pretty well, and was able to handle most of the tasks well.</p>
<p>As far as the benchmarks are concerned, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop performs well in numbers considering the specifications. We managed to get a handsome 2044 and 2100 points in PCMark 8, which are very commendable considering the processor. While the number always doesn’t reflect the performance, all we can say is, we were pretty satisfied with the overall performance of the Aspire 1.</p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming capabilities of this budget-friendly notebook, it is provided with the Intel’s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU. Do note that, the laptop doesn’t come with any other additional graphics processor and is, therefore, not an ideal machine, if you&#8217;re looking for a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming-stationed laptop</a>. Although it is capable of rendering decent graphics and pictures in the videos and lighter games, it simply cannot run high-end games.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a pair of built-in stereo speakers, which are neither weak nor are groundbreaking. That said, the speakers are powerful enough to pump up an audio experience in a small room. The speakers are capable of providing clear and distortion free audio output.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3057" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Speakers-and-Audio-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Speakers and Audio Quality" width="700" height="392" /></p>
<p>We played some HD, Full HD, and 4K content on this laptop, to which it responded well. Thanks to its full HD display, the colors were well reproduced and we had a good time using the laptop as a source of entertainment and multimedia.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 2-cell Li-Ion Battery of 4810 mAh. The laptop being provided with the right set of hardware and features, it provides a very impressive battery backup of up to 9 hours of continuous usage.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, it did provide exceptionally good backup and was able to provide a screen on time of over 8 hours on one full charge. The laptop gets fully charged in just under 2 hours 30 minutes, which we feel is pretty ideal. It is worth noting that, the laptop doesn’t get warm even while charging and using it simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3049" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/acer-aspire-1-a114-31-c4hh-laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop" width="500" height="310" /></p>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 is a mixed bag. That said, there are aspects which makes it tough to believe that it’s a laptop priced at around $200. While, on the other hand, few aspects of the laptop really disappoints, especially, the non-expendable internal storage. Considering every aspect of the laptop, it is quite evident by now that the Acer Aspire 1 is a very affordable and an excellent value for money notebook. For those, who are tight on budget, but wants to stay productive through the versatility of a laptop, then it’s undeniable that there is no better substitute for the Acer Aspire 1, in its segment.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design and built quality of the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, the notebook comes with <strong>grey matte finished chassis</strong>. The laptop resembles most of the other laptops in the segment and is recessed inside a plastic chassis. On the top, the laptop comes with a gunmetal grey slab with Dell’s logo recessed in the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2302" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-image-2302 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-13-5000-2-in-1-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378 13 5000 2 in 1 Laptop - Design" width="600" height="404" /><p id="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop (Gun Metal Color)</strong></p></div>
<p>It sports a 13.3-inch display and comes with a <strong>backlit enabled chuckle keyboard</strong>, which is very well designed for all forms of usage. The trackpad is also very well placed and is comfortable to use. On the either sides of the laptop, you have one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a charging slot. Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with dimensions of 325 x 224 x 20.4mm, which makes it a slim offering in the segment. Also, the laptop <strong>weighs just 3.4 pounds</strong>, making it a perfect portable and easy to carry around laptop, which is <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students – Pro Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most suited for college students</a>, business men or anyone who wants powerful and lightweight laptop for their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2303" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-image-2303 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Different-Modes.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Different Modes" width="700" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1. Tent Mode | 2. Stand Mode | 3. Tablet Mode</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, getting deeper into the convertibility and ergonomics of this laptop, it comes with an innovative <strong>360-degree hinge</strong>, which adds on to the versatility and comfort of usage. The laptop allows you to switch easily between four different modes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tent mode</span> is perfect for using recipes in real time, this mode is also perfect for video calling your friends and family while working on something. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand mode</span> of this convertible notebook is meant for movies on the go. The typical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop mode</span> is meant for most of your routine work that you&#8217;d do from your laptops such as <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on word documents</a>, writing emails, and more.  Finally, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tablet mode</span> makes reading easy while you’re leant or reclined.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop sports a <strong>13.3-inch Full HD display</strong>, which comes with a new design emphasised on more screen and less bezel. This not only gives a larger display but also provides a wide-angle display. The display panel on the device is a TrueLife LED-backlit touch display, which provides a brilliant wide-angle view. The laptop’s screen comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving it a sharper image quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-image-2305 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-convertible-display.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 convertible laptop - display" width="800" height="553" /><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>13.3 Inch Full HD Touchscreen Display with 1920 x 1080 Resolution</strong></p></div>
<p>The laptop’s display is not the brightest you get in the segment, and we felt that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was quite dull</span>. The laptop’s sunlight legibility isn&#8217;t the best, and the blacks on the display weren&#8217;t accurate as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre. All in all, the laptop’s display is surely a worth considering drawback of the notebook. However, its touchscreen functionality works absolutely fine in almost all the use cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as aforementioned offers a good set of specifications and hardware for the asking price.</p>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, speaking about the actual innards of this laptop, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with a handsome set of hardware and features. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, the processor can achieve a clock speed of 3.10GHz, which makes it very easy for the device to handle heavy games and apps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i5 Processors (New 2017 Kaby Lake Laptops)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive <strong>1TB of hard disk with 5400RPM</strong>, which is another attractive feature for the price segment it comes under. It also houses Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor to handle all the graphic related content.</p>
<p><em>Like most of the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small convertible laptops</a>, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop also <strong>doesn&#8217;t house a CD/DVD drive</strong> with it.</em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Dell Inspiron i5378 sports a 720p camera, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. Although the images captured using the laptop’s webcam are kind of grainy, the video calls made are serviceable. The colour reproduction is accurate and a camera does manage to capture a lot of details in the images.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the laptop’s <strong>webcam uses infrared technology to bolster facial recognition</strong>. It&#8217;s actually very hard to find facial recognition in laptops at this price range, which is again a very good aspect of the laptop.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Like all other Dell Inspiron 5000 series of laptops, the 2-in-1 i5378 also comes with a good set of ports to support additional peripheral devices and to make the most of a laptop. Speaking of the ports, the laptop houses <strong>one USB 2.0 port</strong> for your regular usage, <strong>two USB 3.0 ports</strong> for enhanced data transfers and added functionalities when you connect any peripherals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY - Ports and Slots" width="519" height="334" />The laptop also houses a full sized <strong>HDMI port</strong> to connect to any display devices. As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Dell Inspiron also houses a <strong>Micro-SD card reader</strong> slot to connect with an SD card. We would have loved the USB Type-C port and we hope that Dell will include it, may be in their next generation 5000 series convertibles?</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY runs <strong>Windows 10 64-bit Home</strong> variant right out-of-the-box. Windows 10 is absolutely the most productive OS in the contemporary world and evidently, doesn&#8217;t need an introduction in the field of laptops. It is not just productive but is also the most common, easy-to-use, reliable, and an OS with the highest number of compatible apps for laptops.</p>
<p>Like all the latest Inspiron laptops, the current laptop also comes with a set of useful apps, readily installed with the laptop. These includes <em>Dell’s SupportAssist</em> app, which is a fairly useful app to provide the right tech support in case of troubleshooting. The <em>Dell Update</em> app makes sure the laptop runs on the latest OS and has all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the other apps which come preloaded with the laptop, there is some <a title="Software bloat - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloatware</a> includes such as DropBox, Royal Revolt 2, Facebook, Netflix, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Twitter, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, and Houzz. Some of them are useful but others can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>laptop comes with a one-year warranty</strong></span>, like most of the other laptops. However, Dell’s after sales support is far better than that of most of the other brands.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to the latest <strong>Kaby Lake (7th Gen)</strong> Intel Core i5-7200U Processor clocked at up to 3.10 GHz, the new Dell Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop runs utterly smooth in almost all the everyday essentials such as handling apps, using for multimedia purposes, gaming, and more. The processor is paired with a good <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which makes the laptop able to handle multitasking with ease. During our review, we tested the laptop with multiple apps running simultaneously, to which the laptop responded really well. Although there was a very minute lag, it was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>For multitasking, we tested the laptop by running benchmarking apps in the background, Google Chrome with up to 15 tabs opened simultaneously, music in the background, and with a constant connectivity to the internet. The laptop was hardly warmed even after 1 hour of such extensive usage session.</p>
<p>During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good <strong>62,482</strong> on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. On Geekbench 4, the laptop scored <strong>6800</strong> which depicts the overall system performance with a stress on graphics reproducibility. These numbers are pretty impressive for a <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops in $500 - $600 Price Range" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop priced just little above $500</a>.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics bolstered by the <strong>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor</strong>. Although the laptop does have a decent set of specifications, it is not meant for extensive and heavy gaming with high graphics and is, therefore, not a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily gaming stationed laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Although the laptop is not meant to handle heavy games such as GTA V, Battlefield, or the DEUS EX in their highest graphics mode, most of the games like the Counterstrike, heroes of the Storm, and Shadowman were still pretty much playable when the graphics set to low/medium.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop can although handle games and graphic-intense apps to an extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s not for the people whose primary concern is gaming</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with <strong>two built-in Stereo speakers</strong>, which are powered by MaxxAudio technology, for better all round sound. The speakers do a great job in providing decent audio output and also doesn&#8217;t turtle at the volume set to maximum. We played high-quality FLAC files on this laptop and the output was just as loud and clear as expected.</p>
<div id="attachment_2308" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-image-2308 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop Review" width="600" height="574" /><p id="caption-attachment-2308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>High resolution display and 2-stereo speakers makes playing games and watching movies fun</strong></p></div>
<p>As far as playing videos, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop can handle HD, Full HD, 2K, and 4K videos without an issue</span> and thanks to the wide-angle screen, watching videos and movies on this 2-in-1 convertible is fun and convincing.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5378 2-in-1 is a powerful laptop with a decent set of specifications including a Full HD display. As for the battery life, the laptop stays juiced up by a 3-cell, 42 Whr battery pack. During our review, the laptop lasted for around <strong>6 hours of continuous usage</strong>. The battery backup is not the greatest considering other similar laptops in the segment delivering 8-10 hours of battery backup. The laptop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">takes about 3 hours to get charged</span> from 0 to 100.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1937" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY 13-Inch FHD Laptop" width="550" height="350" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-300x191.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />Dell Inspiron i5378 is definitely a power-packed convertible 2-in-1 laptop, which you can get at this price. The laptop does have few pros and cons, but after an extensive review, we personally feel that the laptop has more advantages and benefits than that of its drawbacks. The <strong>dull display can be overlooked</strong> with its convertible feature. Mediocre battery life can be overlooked by its powerful performance.</p>
<p>All in all, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop</span> is definitely a must buy, if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop to flaunt with looks, portability, and performance.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the HP ENVY 13-ab016nr is a premium looking laptop, which is very sleek and ergonomic. The Envy 13 comes with a completely refreshed design aesthetics and looks simply irresistible measuring 8.9 x 12.8 x 0.6 inches. Like the legendary, MacBook Pro, the laptop is completely recessed in an aluminium chassis but is pretty light, and weighs just around 3.3 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1986" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Review" width="300" height="280" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review-50x47.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At the first glance itself, we could see a lot of similarities between the Envy 13 and a MacBook. Although there are certainly remarkable differences in the design and built, the similarities are very evident. The laptop’s lid comes with black bezels, giving a better highlight to the screen. The laptop maintains a uniform thickness throughout the built, which is very remarkable in the laptop these days. The laptop comes with a lifted hinge, which provides its users with a better and more comfort in typing.</p>
<p>Speaking about other sides of the laptop, to the left there is a charging port, an SD card reader slot, a USB Type-C 3.1 port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. To the right, there are two more USB ports and an HDMI port. The keyboard and the trackpad are also very neatly and spaciously recessed. You also get speaker grills, on the either sides of the keyboard, which thumps the volume directly without any distortion.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The HP ENVY 13-ab016nr laptop sports a 13.3 inch diagonal full HD UWVA eDP display. The display is powered by a bright view WLED-backlit technology and comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.</p>
<p>The laptop’s display offers the company’s proprietary Technicolor Color Certification, to deliver true-to-life colors. Although the display offers vivid, bright, and great color gamut, it feels glossy and this affects the viewing angles of the laptop. Due to the glossy coat on the display, the screen is highly reflective, making it tough to use it in bright outdoor conditions. However, we did not face any hiccups with the display during our indoor usage. Moreover, the blacks on the screen are not very punchy, as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1989 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13 ab016nr Notebook Display" width="649" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display.jpg 649w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-300x231.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-610x470.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-600x462.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" />We also ran few benchmarking apps and tools on this laptop, to which the laptop did fare well. It managed to reproduce 94 percent in the sRGB color gamut, which is very good considering the price range. When it comes to the brightness of the screen, it managed to score 410 nits of brightness.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13- ab016nr Notebook, boasts of some really interesting set of specifications under its chassis. The laptop being one of the latest in the market, does come with all the latest lineup of configuration.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the HP Envy 13 is powered by a latest seventh gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 2.5 GHz, but can certainly obtain a full throttle of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. This mode can not only provide you with a punchy performance but also lets you get the most out of the laptop. For handling apps and multitasking, it is equipped with an 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM, which although is not the best you can get in the market, but it certainly is good enough to provide a smoother multitasking.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1991 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Hardware.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Hardware Review" width="753" height="450" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Hardware.jpg 753w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Hardware-300x179.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Hardware-610x365.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Hardware-600x359.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Hardware-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></p>

<p>For all the <a title="Gaming Laptops - Archives" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming and graphics enthusiasts</a>, the laptop is stuffed with an Intel HD 620 graphics, which is good, if not the great. Graphics on this laptop worked well during our review, provided we have our expectations checked.</p>
<p>And finally, now comes the predominant part of the hardware of any laptop—the storage. The HP envy 13-ab016nr laptop offers a 256GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 Solid State Drive, which we feel is a little less and could have been much better if it was anything beyond 500GB. However, the solid state drive is fast, efficient, and more reliable than hard drive for the cause.</p>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13-ab016nr comes with an HP web camera recessed on top of the screen. The webcam provided with the laptop is bolstered by the HP’s proprietary TrueVision HD Webcam. TrueVision, allows you to get vibrant clarity and very good color gamut during the video call sessions, and can also aid in clicking pictures using the laptop. The camera is decent to work with and can also work well in low-lit conditions. All-In-All, the webcam on the Envy 13 does beyond satisfaction being a laptop’s camera.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook sports 3 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports for reliable, and lightning fast data transfers. They also aid you in connecting peripherals with the laptops easily. It also sports an HDMI port and one DisplayPort to extend the display onto another device.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1992 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Ports and Slots" width="1044" height="800" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 1044w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots-300x230.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots-768x589.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots-1024x785.jpg 1024w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots-610x467.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots-600x460.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Ports-and-Slots-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1044px) 100vw, 1044px" />As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Envy 13 also comes with a Micro-SD card reader slot to connect with an SD card.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13 laptop runs Windows 10 out of the box. Windows needs no introduction in the field of laptops as it is the most common, productive, easy-to-use, and reliable OS for laptops. Accordingly, the HP Envy 13 also offers a great UI, thanks to the latest Windows 10, and it also offers all the interesting features of the Windows 10 including Connect with Cortana. Cortana is your new personal assistant in Windows 10 based machines and this works perfectly well with the HP envy 13 ab016nr notebook.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1994" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Software" width="945" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software.jpg 945w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-300x159.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-768x406.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-610x323.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-600x317.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" />During our review, we faced no issues of hurdles in using Cortana and the laptop was able to identify proper voice commands from us. It also helps in setting reminders, alerts, setting plans, and more, all making it even more productive and fun to use. Some of the additional software which come preloaded are CyberLink PowerDirector, Netflix, and McAfee LiveSafe which can be easily uninstalled if not required.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Thanks to the 7th Gen Kaby Lake intel core i5 processor, the laptop does provide seamless performance in almost all instances. Although you can get a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops with Intel Core i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop powered by intel core i7</a> at this price, it is the generation of processor, which makes a difference here. Kaby Lake series of processors from Intel are undoubted, power-packed processors, and are also very power efficient when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<p>The good 8GB of RAM and the processor runs the show for the Envy 13 and runs really well. During our review and usage, we hardly noticed any issues in the perspective of performance of this laptop. We also throttled the laptop to its limits by running a number of heavy applications such as photoshop, games, and intensive benchmarking applications, and the laptop remained cool and calm, in performing these tasks. Chrome runs absolutely fine even with around 10-15 tabs opened simultaneously, the transition effects, Cortana’s usage, app switching, multitasking, background resource utilities, everything is just perfect with the HP Envy 13-ab016nr, and is, therefore, the most stylish and powerful laptop in its segment.</p>

<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, it isn&#8217;t any groundbreaking in this segment. Most of the common games run fine on this laptop, but it struggles in handling graphic intensive games when the graphics are set to maximum. Modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the laptop comes with dual stereo speakers on either side of the keyboard. The sound is clear and thanks to the placements of the speakers, the sound is forward stationed and doesn&#8217;t have any distortions like the laptops having speakers beneath or to the side of the chassis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="274" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers.jpg 960w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-300x86.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-768x219.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-610x174.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-600x171.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />The audio on the laptop is tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen and booming HP Audio Boost, which pretty much pairs up really well to provide a quality sound output. Also, all forms of videos, 4K, UHD, Full HD, and HD played well without stutter.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is another attractive feature of this laptop, thanks to the slim and sleek built, the laptop offers good battery life than most of its competitors. Although the company claims that the HP Envy 13-ab016nr can provide over 14 hours of continuous usage, in our review we found that it was able to stay alive for around 8-10 hours based on the usage. This is still way better than most of the laptops at its segment. The laptop is powered by HP’s Fast Charge technology, which can charge your device for 90% in just around 90 minutes.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1970" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook" width="500" height="338" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook.jpg 500w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook-300x203.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />All that said, we’d like to conclude our review saying that- you&#8217;ll not regret in the near future buying this <a title="Checkout Other Best Laptops Under $600" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop at this price of around $600</a>. If you want a slim, sleek, sturdy, and a well-built laptop which not only looks premium and good but is also capable of delivering outstanding performance, then look no further, the HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook is probably the best you can get. However, if you&#8217;re ok with carrying the same old chunkier laptops, then you might get some even more powerful laptops at this price range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS was one of the very first brands among all the traditional laptop makers, to step into the gaming arena and challenge the pioneers like MSI and Alienware series of laptops. It all started with the ROG (Republic of Gamers) series of laptops from ASUS, which was not only priced competitively but was also a very good all-around performer. Soon after the company started to earn fame and reputation in the gaming arena, it started to release a series of laptops with the primary emphasis on gaming to attract a large audience.</p>
<p>Our current laptop, the ASUS FX502VM Gaming Laptop is one among the newly launched gaming series of laptop from ASUS, which is now one of the most selling gaming laptops at around $1000.

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM looks thick and hefty right from the very first look. However, the laptop is very finely engineered and ergonomically built. The laptop comes with a curved chassis as seen on the ROG series with imposed curves with an ASUS logo imposed on the lid. The laptop is thick at the centre and gradually gets narrower towards the edges.</p>
<div id="attachment_1852" style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-image-1852 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png" alt="Asus FX502VM Gaming Laptop - Dimensions" width="469" height="550" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions.png 469w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-256x300.png 256w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-Gaming-Laptop-Dimensions-43x50.png 43w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852" class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t see gaming laptops this thin more often!</p></div>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15.4 x 10.5 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weights around 4.9 pounds, which although isn&#8217;t that hefty for a gaming laptop, still feels a little cumbersome to carry around.</p>
<p>Both the sides of the laptop are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The laptop comes in matte finished colour giving a perfect gaming hue to the users. As soon as you open the lid, you see a very aggressive looking futuristic keyboard. The keyboard on the laptop comes with red backlit keys, which adapts a theme according to the game we play. Moreover, the trackpad on the laptop is also spaciously arranged in the body, giving it a perfect ease of usage.</p>

<p>All in all, the ASUS FX502VM comes with a finely engineered futuristic design. The laptop feels really sturdy but is, unfortunately, slightly heavy to carry around.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Our ASUS FX502VM features a 15.6-inch full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. With these numbers kept in mind, it is quite vibrant enough for movies and games. As soon as we started testing out the laptop, we played some 4K content on it, to which the laptop’s display responded really well. When watching a 4K trailer of injustice: Gods among us, all the colours popped up really well with high colour gamut. Moreover, the viewing angles on the laptop are also really great and can easily cover over 160-degrees without getting smudged.</p>
<p>Our lab tests also proved the ASUS FX502VM’s impressive colour performance. The laptop managed to produce 184.7 percent of the sRGB colour gamut, which is by far one of the best we measured. That not only means that this display is bright and colourful, but also means that it is accurate than most of its rivals in the price segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_1855" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-image-1855 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png" alt="Asus FX502VM-AH51 Gaming Laptop - Display" width="780" height="502" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display.png 780w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-300x193.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-768x494.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-610x393.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-600x386.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Asus-FX502VM-AH51-Gaming-Laptop-Display-50x32.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1855" class="wp-caption-text">15 Inch Display with Full HD Resolution, 100% sRGB and Wide Viewing Angles.</p></div>
<p>During our entire review and usage, we never ever felt that the display on the ASUS FX502VM was even a bit dim. It is bright, vivid, colourful, and wide. As far as the benchmarking numbers are concerned, ASUS’s notebook managed to register an average brightness of 289 nits on our light meter, which is an edging out figure for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware on ASUS FX502VM: It is powered by a sixth generation gaming-centric Intel core i5-6300HQ mobile processor clocked at 2.3GHz. For multitasking, the processor is paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM. The laptop comes with thermal cooling technology, and thus makes use of dual cooling fans, to prevent the innards getting warm even under heavy usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_1856" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1856" class="wp-image-1856 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM.jpg" alt="Intelligent Thermal Cooling on Asus FX502VM 15 Inch Gaming Laptop" width="750" height="586" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-300x234.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-610x477.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-600x469.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Intelligent-Thermal-Cooling-on-Asus-FX502VM-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1856" class="wp-caption-text">Intelligent Thermal Design &#8211; Hyper cool duo-copper cooling system keeps laptop always at comfortable temperature.</p></div>
<p>As far as storage on the laptop is concerned, it comes with a 1TB of hard disk, with an RPM of 7200. This not only ensures faster data transfers but also ensures of being a reliable data storage medium. Graphics on the laptop are handled by NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics coprocessor with a dedicated DDR5 memory of 3GB. This is the new Pascal architecture based GPU from NVidia. Hence, Asus FX502VM is a VR Ready gaming laptop and it can run all 360° games, videos and other VR content without any problems.</p>
<p>ASUS FX502 has a specially-designed chiclet gaming keyboard with red-backlit scissor-switch keys that offer the users a large 1.6mm of travel distance. Greater the travel distance, better is the tactile feedback for keystrokes. In addition to that, the laptop also features highlighted WASD keys for user convenience. The keyboard on this laptop is undoubtedly best for gaming, but apart from that it can also be used by <a title="Top Recommended Laptops for College for Every Budget" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students for college</a> or by <a title="The Best Laptops for Computer Programmers for Coding/Programming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers for coding</a> and playing games.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The laptop sports an HD Webcam on top of the display. The camera on this laptop is not the best you get at this budget but is adequate enough to meet the basic requirements of a typical laptop’s webcam. Yes, you can make Skype calls, and can even take few selfies during your leisure. On top of that, there is nothing much to be discussed in this section.</p>
<h4>Ports</h4>
<p>ASUS FX502VM crams a number of useful and productively usable ports onto its small frame. On the left side, you&#8217;ll find a proprietary power port, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI-out, an audio jack, 1x mini Display Port, and a microSD card reader.</p>

<p>The right side houses two USB 2.0 ports, which are more than good enough for most peripherals you might attach, but we wish there was another USB 3.0 so we could take advantage of the <a title="Shop External Hard Drives on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2htYAfG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fastest external hard drives available in market</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS FX502VM runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and is naturally, one of the flexible operating systems for laptops. The Windows 10, is not just good at UI but is also very productive. It has millions of apps, compatible with it and provides a deeper level of customizations to its users. Apart from all the standard lineup of Windows 10 applications and software, the ASUS FX502VM also packs in some of the ASUS’s proprietary applications of security and productivity.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with 1-year Accidental Damage Protection along with 30 days of Zero Bright Dot Guarantee, which is one of the most comprehensive coverages available for laptops. This gives you protection against accidental drops, spills and electrical surges of the laptop.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The laptop does deliver an outstanding performance in its class. Thanks to an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor paired with a massive 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of hard disk drive, the laptop is surely a power-packed performer.</p>

<p>We personally feel that the laptop could have been even better if it had an SSD drive instead of HDD. During our usage, the laptop’s hard drive was reading data at 145MB/s and was writing at 135MB/s, so while nowhere near as fast as the SSD it&#8217;s clearly a decent 7200rpm model. Keeping the hard drive details aside, the laptop being a powerful gaming performer, can handle all the general daily essentials with ease. During our usage, we ran a couple of RAM consuming benchmarks, brewer with more than 15 tabs opened, music playing in the background, with a high-end game running in the background. The laptop was handling multitasking with ease and is a powerful, stable, and reliable daily performer.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With that out of the way, we can accolade the ASUS FX502VM for being a gaming-stationed laptop and to the fact that it is stuffed with the Nvidia’s latest GTX 1060 GPU (the main reason to get excited about this laptop). The laptop was able to handle Alien Isolation with all settings maxed out and resolution set to 1080p at an average 75fps. However, the laptop did face few hiccups at 188fps wherein the visuals dropped slightly.</p>
<p>We installed a long list of high-end games on this laptop, thanks to its massive 1TB of hard drive. We tested the laptop with our all time favourite The Witcher III, Overwatch, and Heroes of the Storm. The best part, the laptop was able to handle all these games with ease even with the graphics set to max. Surely, the laptop stands in its words- The best gaming laptop at the budget. So for all the gaming lovers out there who are slightly tight on budget, this is probably the best you can get.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Being a gaming laptop, it is essential for the ASUS FX502VM to accommodate powerful, detailed, and loud stereo output. During our usage, we found the speakers are excellent and hold their ground. As we always mention, multimedia is one of the most vital aspects of any laptop and our contender is packed with dual HD stereo speakers with DTS tech-enabled, which does the task of providing punchy audio pretty well.</p>

<p>We tested the speakers with bass heavy punchy tracks such as no church in the west and power bass, to which the speakers on the laptop responded really well. We also tested the laptop with treble based cleaner tracks, to which it responded well again. The laptop can play all sorts of HD content including 4K with ease. After all, this packs in the latest Nvidia’s GTX 1060!</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The ASUS FX502VM is juiced using a 4-cell Lithium-ion battery. After all our usage, all we can say is the laptop does provide an outstanding battery backup. That said, being a gaming-stationed laptop, we honestly, didn&#8217;t expect much from it. The laptop lasted for just over 4 hours under continuous gaming, which is still a decent backup for a laptop with this configuration and features. However, if you aren&#8217;t gaming continuously you can expect slightly better battery backup. The laptop can be charged fully from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Bottom line: <em>Are you a hardcore gamer but slightly tight on budget? Go for it blindfolded!</em></h3>
<p>With a price tag of around $1250, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASUS FX502VM 15.6&#8243; Gaming Laptop</span> is undoubtedly our first choice, if you need a power-packed gaming machine. Moreover, there aren&#8217;t many laptops at this price point which is primarily meant for gaming. Although the laptop is not as powerful as the ASUS’s flagship ROG series of laptops or the MSI’s dominators, it still is a very efficient, reliable, and powerful all-round performer.</p>
