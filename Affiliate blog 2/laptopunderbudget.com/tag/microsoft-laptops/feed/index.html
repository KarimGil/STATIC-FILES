										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like the Surface Pro 6, Microsoft has not played around much with the design of its Surface Laptop. A similar device has been released as its sequel &#8211; the Surface Laptop 2. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it definitely does not mean that the Surface Laptop 2 doesn&#8217;t pack some exciting new features.</p>
<h3>Laptop in Black</h3>
<p>Adding a classier touch to its recent Surface device unveiling, Microsoft confirmed the all-black rumors a few hours prior to the event. The all black series was certainly awaited by pro laptop users (yes Apple geeks too) but Microsoft jumped at the opportunity first. But despite the deep and suave dark appearance the chassis cannot mask the fingerprints like all other aluminum body laptops.</p>
<p>The keyboard is quite impressive though. Much quieter and smoother than the Surface Laptop and other Microsoft predecessors. This makes it the perfect device to take notes in silent office and classroom settings.</p>
<h3>What the Surface Laptop 2 does</h3>
<p>Coming to what&#8217;s inside the beautiful black finish, Microsoft has installed new quad-core 8th generation processors from Intel. We all know this means a major boost in the overall performance of the laptop. 85% to be exact, as claimed by Microsoft. The Surface Laptop 2 hasn&#8217;t lost its signature Alcantara fabric keyboard, adding an element of warmth and comfort for its users. The laptop has a <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13.5-inch display</a>, supports touch and a resolution of 2,2256 x 1,506 PixelSense display. The 3:2 aspect ratio minimizes scrolling and adds productivity while going about your daily tasks.</p>
<p>The Surface Laptop 2 boasts a 47 watt-hour battery that can juice up to 14.5 hours of battery life. Quite impressive if compared to the 10 hour charge of MacBook Pro. Seems like Microsoft might be aiming to dethrone Apple&#8217;s flagship notebooks.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft claims to have re-engineered the entire electronics of the machine, the need for having cooling fans in the laptop goes out the window. Given the reduced overload on the system of running the fans, the impressive battery life kind of pans out.</p>
<p>But then again, the absence of USB Type-C port in the laptop makes absolutely no sense, depending solely on the single USB-A, Mini DisplayPort, and for power and docking &#8211; the Microsoft’s Surface Connector port. Good thing the 3.5mm headphone jack is still there.</p>
<h3>When can you get it</h3>
<p>The starting bid for the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 is from $999 (for the basic model). It is up for pre-grab now at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptops%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-2%2Fpcmcat1537304410246.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1537304410246" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://afflnk.microsoft.com/c/1267222/433017/7593?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-laptop-2%2F8XQJKK3DD91B%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft Store</a> and launching officially on October 16. Coming packed with an 8th gen (Kaby Lake Refresh), quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, a 128GB of SSD space and an 8GB of memory.</p>
<p>If you are a tech geek, boost the specs up to Intel Core i7 processors, up to 1TB of SSD space and as much as 16GB of memory for the price going up to $2,700. Of course with the same screen in this package.</p>
<p>Same as the Surface Pro 6, the Surface Laptop 2 comes in 4 exciting shades. Black (new), Burgundy, Platinum, and Cobalt blue.</p>

<h3><span style="font-style: inherit;">Final word</span></h3>
<p>The striking and eye-catching design is a huge plus. Even if you are not a Surface fan, the cool appearance will draw you to at least explore the device even if you don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>Weighing just 2.76 lbs and with a comfortable keyboard, it&#8217;s a dream to carry around your entire day. Also, the massive battery life and the high tech processing capabilities easily put the Surface Laptop 2 amongst the list of best next-gen notebook series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Microsoft&#8217;s Surface event on Tuesday, Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 made their first appearances. The Surface Pro 6 is a sleek, slim convertible tablet but lacks a certain option.</p>
<h3>Where is the USB C?</h3>
<p>A little birdy has been telling all Surface fans about the two USB-C ports in Microsoft&#8217;s upcoming Surface device since last year.</p>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HCVUCqZoHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You can see in this promotional video, a Surface device prototype with a couple of USB-C ports. Techies were looking forward to this spec being one of the highlights of Microsoft&#8217;s Surface event in New York. But instead, Microsoft decided to skip it all together in their Surface Pro 6 laptop. With the addition of new ports in Surface Go and Surface Book 2, the consistency to be followed for Surface Pro 6 only made sense.</p>
<p>Moorhead said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But I have to say that Microsoft does already have multiple ways to add an external display, which is really the biggest reason to have USB-C.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although disappointing, it does come with some impressive tweaks. And when I say tweaks, I mean that there were no major upgrades to be classified as &#8216;overhauls&#8217;. Given the popularity of Microsoft Surface Pro amongst corporate users, the tech giant may not have wanted to ruin a good thing that they have going on.</p>
<p>The two in one convertible tablet is crafted with a smooth matt black finish, to again &#8211; fit the portfolio of a &#8216;corporate suited device&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our customers have been asking for black because it is professional and elegant&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Said Raphael Jose, Product Manager of Surface at Microsoft, on CRN at the launch event.</p>
<h3>The insides</h3>
<p>Now for the upgrades, Microsoft Surface Pro 6 boasts an Eighth gen- Intel Core i5 or i7 processors. Microsoft’s Surface chief, Panos Panay, says the company has improved the processing power with the Surface Pro 6. Microsoft stated that the Pro 6 is 67 times faster and efficient than the previous Surface models.</p>
<p>The insides of the machine are claimed to fend off overheating better that is due to the support of quad-core processors and the thermal cooling system in the i7 version. But if you still want to go fanless, try the i5 model.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4210" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Microsoft-Surface-Family-in-New-Black-Color.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Family in New Black Color" width="850" height="478" /></p>
<p>The device can be held up in 3 different positions, the laptop mode, flat out on a surface or a studio mode. It comes with a black matt hinge for propping up top, so the Pro 6 can play your favorite media in this cinematic mode for up to 13.5 hours on a single charge. Apart from the all-day battery life, the extremely portable body and a solid-state drive (SSD), the Surface Pro 6 has moved past the traditional 4GB RAM. Coming just in 8GB or 16GB variants, the Surface Pro 6 will be configurable with 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the detachable keyboard and its compatibility with Surface Pen and Surface Dial has added a touch of creativity to this little gimmick. Microsoft has stepped up the game on the screen display too. With a 12.3 inch screen, the Surface Pro 6 possesses a bright 5 million pixel for a PPI of 267. This is kind of a game changer in terms of displays in the Surface series.</p>
<h3>Pre-orders and Availability</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4213 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-6-Matt-Black-Preorders.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 6 - Matt Black Preorders" width="650" height="428" /></p>
<p>The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is said to be available from 16th October at all the major online retailers and brick and mortar stores but you can preorder it right now. Starting off with $899 for a basic model with eighth-gen Core i5, 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, the Surface Pro 6 is available for pre-order on <a title="Check out on Best Buy" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fnew-microsoft-surface-devices%3Fref%3D199%26loc%3DJAF5WzpxbKM%26acampID%3D1%26siteID%3DJAF5WzpxbKM-_oyIjt9_s.HFHeEYqPlekg%26intl%3Dnosplash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Best Buy</a> and on the <a title="Check out on Microsoft Store" href="https://afflnk.microsoft.com/c/1267222/433017/7593?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-pro-6%2F8zcnc665slq5%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft store</a>. For Core i7 variant with 256 GB of storage, the price tag on the Surface Pro 6 goes up to $1,499.</p>
<p>Note that these rates do not include a Type Cover keyboard which is available in 4 interesting shades. The Cobalt Blue, Burgundy, Platinum, and Black. Also, the Surface Pen that comes bundled with Surface Book 2 costs extra $99 with the new Surface Pro 6.</p>
<p>Microsoft also unveiled Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Studio 2 at the event and released the October 2018 Windows 10 update for existing Windows PCs.</p>
