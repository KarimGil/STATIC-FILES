										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer Predator Helios 300 has been one of our most recommended gaming laptops since it was launch in 2017. We got a revision in 2018 with some changes in internals, but it was a mere spec bump as the chassis did not see anything new. In 2019, Acer has remastered it’s best selling machine by giving it a complete design overhaul and revamped thermals which Acer claims will lead to a significant difference in the experience of an average gamer.</p>
<p>When put to the test, the new Predator Helios 300 does deliver the claims made by the company while still keeping the price near to $1000. The new design appeals a look which is more modern than ever, the spec sheet with the Core i7 9750H hexa core processor and Nvidia’s Turing graphics ticks all the checkboxes and leaves nothing more to be desired. The new cooling solution also seems to help a lot. Overall, on the performance front, Acer has delivered the no-nonsense gaming machine which every gamer always asked for.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design is the most improved aspect of this machine. The 2019 Predator Helios 300 has an entirely new blue design which calls for a breath of fresh air after years of generic red and black gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The laptop has an aluminum top surface and deck, which combined with the sturdy hinge, provide the feel of strong build quality. It does add a little bit of weight though, the laptop weighs 5.1 lbs (2.3 kg) which is not light by any means, but it is slightly lighter and slimmer than the <a title="Acer Predator Helios 300 Review (PH315-51-78NP) – Breaking Stereotypes of Budget Gaming Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-review-ph315-51/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous generation</a>. It is still on the bulkier side but in line with the competition and portable enough to carry in a backpack.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5868 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-2019-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 (2019) Gaming Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="680" height="400" /></p>
<p>The design is ergonomic and minimalist. The only problem I faced was that the outline is a little angular which caused some trouble while typing and needs getting used to. Apart from that, the overall new design language by Acer was a much needed change and will be appreciated by every user.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 houses a 15.6 inch 1080p IPS display, which has a refresh rate of 144 Hz and a response time of 3ms. On-paper, the display is on par with the other <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">costly gaming laptops</a> out there.</p>
<p>The thin bezels add to the clean design language that Acer is going for. The 79% screen-to-body ratio provides the laptop with a sleek and modern look. They are not super-thin, so it can house the webcam up top unlike modern ultrabooks even though nobody is going to use it because it’s only good enough for video calls as there is no Windows Hello support.</p>
<div id="attachment_5871" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-image-5871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL 1080p 144Hz Display Review" width="612" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-5871" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Best Display in Sub-$1000 Gaming Laptops Category</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The color accuracy is better than average with 97% SRGB and 75% ARGB color gamut. It’s not <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfect for color accurate work</a>, but more than enough for a great gaming experience. The peak brightness of the panel was recorded at 343 nits which should result in good visibility outdoors.</p>
<p>The panel does suffer from backlight bleed issues. It is not the same on all the laptops and will depend totally on luck if your panel is unusable in a worst-case scenario. Backlight bleed does not affect gaming or reading text a lot, where it’s most noticeable is movies that have black bars on the corners of the screen.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard and trackpad are the most easily underlooked parts in <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptops</a>. The keyboard on this laptop is similar on the inside as the last year’s model. Even though it looks different with the blue accents and RGB backlighting, the underlying functionality and the layout is the same for the most part.</p>
<div id="attachment_5873" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-image-5873 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop-Keyboard-and-Trackpad.jpg" alt="2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop - Keyboard and Trackpad Review" width="750" height="484" /><p id="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>White Backlit Keyboard with Blue Accent</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Small improvements are made to the keyboard like increased key travel distance and 4 zone RGB backlight instead of the red backlight from last year. Some lower configurations don’t have the complete customizable RGB backlighting but only a subtle white light which is still better than red.</p>
<p>The trackpad has a plastic surface; it is inferior to glass trackpads but does the job. It does not suffer any hiccups or misreads thanks to windows precision drivers. The size is also good enough. Both the trackpad and keyboard are easy to get used to, and most people will find them comfortable to use without any complaints.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The new Acer Predator Helios 300 features the same specifications as any other $1200 gaming laptop in 2019, a hexa-core i7-9750H CPU that can boost up to 4.5 GHz on a single core and 4.0 GHz on all cores, 16GB of dual-channel memory and Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti graphics with 6GB of GDDR6 virtual memory.</p>
<p>However, the spec sheet is not where it’s at. The optimization and tuning done by Acer take this laptop one step ahead of the competition. It comes factory-undervolted, which allows the CPU to maintain boost clock while sucking less power and generating less heat as a result. The ‘Turbo’ button overclocks the GPU and runs the fans at max speed to get the most out of the machine. Acer has taken care of every small detail which allows this laptop to edge out the competition. One thing to note here is that Nvidia’s GTX 1660 Ti comes in a few different configurations meant for different form factor designs. The Predator Helios 300 houses a full 80W TDP configuration of the GTX 1660 Ti. It’s safe to say it is the most powerful GTX 1660 Ti laptop out there.</p>

<p>The rest of the components are pretty well balanced; there are a few storage options to choose from. You can configure the laptop on Amazon with either a 256GB or a 512GB NVMe SSD. The read and write speeds are similar to most NVMe SSDs out there. On the inside, there are 2x SODIMM memory slots, 2x M.2 drive slots and an empty 2.5-inch drive bay to add a SATA SSD or a spinning HDD of your choice. Ram, storage and WiFi card can easily be upgraded by opening only a few screws. Acer has ensured the machine is very user-friendly to upgrade and service.</p>

<p>Gaming performance is where the 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 shines; it manages to stick out from the stack of all GTX 1660 Ti laptops by beating every single one of them. The dual-channel memory helps to achieve better 1% lows, and the experience is seamless. The CPU stayed at peak boost frequency all the time while playing Battlefield V.</p>
<p>If you play a lot of competitive multiplayer titles, dropping the graphics settings a bit can help max out the fps to match the display’s 144 Hz refresh-rate which is the best way to enjoy these titles.</p>
<h3>Thermals &amp; Acoustics</h3>
<p>The two fans, one dedicated to the CPU and GPU each, exhaust air out of the four vents, two on the rear, and two on the sides. Acer has done a great job of keeping this laptop cool by pre-undervolting the CPU. Under full load, the keyboard deck stays under a manageable 50°C. The CPU temperature reached a high of 85°C, and the GPU touched a max of 70°C. These temperatures are easily manageable, and no thermal throttling or power limit throttling was noticed. The testing was done with an ambient temperature of 22°C, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<div id="attachment_5874" style="width: 667px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-image-5874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3D-Aero-Blade-Fans-on-2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="New 3D Aero Blade Fans on 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop" width="657" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-5874" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Improved 4th Gen 3D Aero Blade Fans for Better Airflow</strong></em></p></div>
<p>If you’re doing any CPU-heavy tasks on this laptop, you’re going to see the best results with the Turbo profile that can be initiated with the Turbo button on the deck. It automatically sets the optimum clock speed for the GPU and provides the CPU 25% more power to work with. It does increase the fan noise to slightly uncomfortable 55dB as it ramps up the fans to max speed. But that’s a sacrifice you’re going to have to make to maximize performance. It’s unnoticeable when you have headphones on.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5876 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Gaming Laptop Ports and Slots" width="708" height="602" /></p>
<p>On the right, we see a full-size HDMI port, a mini DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.1 port, and 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C port.</p>
<p>The only thing missing here is an SD card slot, which is a bummer for <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creative professionals</a> who use SD cards to transfer data to and from cameras. The type-c port, sadly, does not support Thunderbolt 3.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery on this laptop is a 58 Wh unit. Battery backup was recorded at 3-3.5 hours while doing normal tasks like browsing and watching a video with screen brightness at 250 nits and using Nvidia Optimus to force use the integrated Intel graphics. Under load, while gaming or doing any heavy tasks, don’t expect more than 45 minutes of juice out of the small battery.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5882 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-PH315-52-78VL-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-78VL Review - best gaming laptop in $1000 price range" width="628" height="500" /></p>
<p>The 180W AC adapter is fairly large but can be easily managed in a backpack. It adds some weight making the package about 6.1 lbs (2.8 kg) heavy to carry around.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>For $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 provides amazing value when compared to the competition. Not only does this machine outperform every <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other similarly priced laptop</a>, it does so without any compromises. With the out of the box CPU undervolt, Acer has knocked this one out of the park.</p>
<p>The balanced specifications on this laptop make it a good buy for gamers and content creators. It has a good screen, a stellar keyboard, can be easily upgraded, provides excellent gaming performance, and stays cool while doing so. The price drops to below $1100 often, and in the Black Friday sale, it dropped to a lowest of $930, which makes the Predator Helios 300 the best bang for the buck gaming laptop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Looking for a laptop which can replace your high-end desktop? Then you need to look at nowhere than the best intel i7 processor laptops because laptops powered by an intel i7 processor are one of the most powerful laptops among intel processor laptops and therefore they are the most suitable portable machines for power demanding tasks like gaming, video and film editing, music production, CAD, etc. Well, if you go one step down, then Intel i5 processor laptops are still great affordable performers. So, do you really need an i7 laptop? Which are the best core i7 laptops available to buy? Let&#8217;s find it out&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-600"></span></p>
<p class="p1">Intel is a giant in manufacturing computer hardware, and when it comes to processors, Intel has their flagship processor in the form of &#8216;Intel Core i9 processor&#8217;, and it is the best gaming and creation laptop processor Intel has ever built, but it is not for everyone. It offers 6 cores and has 12 threads with a clock frequency of up to 4.8 GHz which will be overkill for average users like you and me. Intel Core i9 CPU is best suited to power users like videographers who have to edit high-resolution videos or engineers for 3D designing. For normal users who want to multitask or play the newest games at respectable frame rates and edit photos and videos, <em>Intel Core i7 processor is still the best option</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">Intel Core i7 processor is powering millions (if not billions) of PCs and laptops around the world. And, if we talk about the &#8216;laptops&#8217; specifically, then Intel i7 processor laptops is still known for their desktop-class performance and power saving capabilities. However, the performance of every core i7 laptop differs with the different model of the Intel i7 processor installed in the laptop.</p>
<p class="p1">So next question that might be hitting your mind right now is;</p>

	</div><h4 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Which Intel i7 Processor Model Laptop is Perfect For You?</h4>
<hr>
<p class="p1">To decide this, you need to check and understand the specifications of each Intel i7 processor model. Let me help you with that as well&#8230;</p>
<p class="p1">Below is the table which has specifications of each and every mobile (laptop) Intel i7 processor models&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_5690" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5690" class="wp-image-5690 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Intel-i7-processors-comparison-2019.png" alt="mobile intel i7 processors comparison" width="750" height="361"><p id="caption-attachment-5690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Mobile Intel i7 Processors Comparison (Data were taken from <a title="Coffee Lake Mobile Intel i7 CPU" href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/122593/8th-generation-intel-core-i7-processors.html#@Mobile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">intel.com</a>)</strong></p></div>
<p>As you can see, there are number of i7 processors for laptops based on the cache memory, clock frequency, integrated graphics and number of cores and threads. To buy the best i7 laptop for yourself, you have to consider all these specifications and then decide which i7 processor model laptop is perfect for your work.</p>

<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i>
	</div><h4>Expert&#8217;s Tip &#8211;</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you want the laptop for heavy multitasking and occasional gaming, then buy quad-core (U-Series) i7 processor laptop with 8MB cache memory. It will output enough thrust of power for your everyday works and also save you few bucks to buy a <a title="Best Selling Laptop Backpacks on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2No01ze" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">nice backpack for your new laptop</a>.</li>
<li>If you are looking for a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end laptop for gaming</a> or doing other intensive tasks, then go with the hexacore (H-Series) i7 processor laptop with 9MB or more cache memory. It will be able to run all the latest games without any lag and also do 4K (and 8K!) video rendering.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Top Recommended Laptops for Video Editing</a></strong></em></p>
</div>

<p>So now you might have decided, with which Intel core i7 processor model you will go for your new laptop&#8230;</p>
<p>But wait..!</p>
<p>Have you checked laptops powered by i5 processors? Because i5 processor laptops are great affordable all-around performers and some of them even outperform laptops powered by Intel i7 processor. Yes, that&#8217;s true! The H-Series quad-core i5 processor laptops are powerful than U-Series quad-core i7 processor laptops and they are cheaper too!</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s again confusion &#8211;</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-outline vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">Whether you should buy Intel i5 Processor Laptop or Intel i7 Processor Laptop?</h4>
<hr>
<p>The easiest way to decide this is, by keeping benchmark scores of both CPUs side by side and check which processor wins in it. Here you go&#8230;</p>
<h5>Cinebench R15 Multi-Core CPU Score</h5>
<p>Cinebench R15 is a benchmark test performed to check the performance of CPU and GPU. It will give an idea about the real-life performance of CPU when used for movie editing or animation. Check out score of Intel Core i5-9300H and Intel Core i7-8565U in the below-given image.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5691 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cinebench-R15-i7-i5-CPU-Score.png" alt="Cinebench R15 CPU Score to compare i5 processor laptops and i7 processor laptops" width="537" height="433"></p>
<h5>Intel Processors 3DMark Score</h5>
<p>3DMark of CPU score is used to analyze the performance of processors and graphics card to check gaming capabilities of any computer setup or laptop. This will give you the idea on gaming performance of Intel Core i5 and i7 Processors. Check out below given image (higher is better).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5692 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3D-Mark-of-Intel-i5-i7-CPU-Score.png" alt="3DMark of Intel Processors Score" width="538" height="428"></p>
<h5>X264 HD Benchmark Test of Intel Processors Score</h5>
<p>X264 HD is a benchmark test that measures how fast a CPU can transcode 1080p video clip into an x264 file. If you are going to do a lot of high definition video rendering on your i7 laptop, then this score will show you the comparison of it with Intel Core i5 processors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5693 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/X264-Benchmark-Processor-Score.png" alt="X264 Video Transcoding Intel CPU Stress Test Score" width="533" height="430">As you can see that in all the benchmark tests, Intel Core i7-8565U loses against Intel Core i5-9300H, that&#8217;s because i5-9300H has higher base clock frequency than the i7-8565U. So, for performance-oriented works, the quad-core i5 is a lot better than the quad-core i7 powered laptop.</p>
<p>So definitely, it is better to buy a laptop with the H-Series (i5-9300H &amp; i5-8300H) quad-core i5 processor rather than buying the laptop with U-Series (i7-8565U &amp; i7-8550U) quad-core i7 processor but there&#8217;s also one benefit of buying an Intel i7 processor laptop over i5 processor laptop, and that is <strong>battery efficiency</strong>. The U-series Intel i7 processor is more energy efficient than H-series Intel i5 processor so battery backup of i7 quad core laptops will be much higher than quad-core i5 processor laptops.</p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s your choice. You can either buy the laptop with H-series quad-core i5 processor which will give better performance or buy the laptop with U-series quad-core i7 processor to have more battery backup from your laptop.

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/327NiUw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5695 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Acer-Aspire-5.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 5 15-Inch Quad Core Intel i7 Processor Laptop" width="550" height="393"></a></p>
<p>Acer Aspire 5 is one of the best affordable laptop with i7 processor you can buy right now. It is priced less than $700, and at that price, Acer is offering a lot more than you would expect in this laptop!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-exterior-design.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 2018 - exterior design" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Our Most Recommended Portable Laptops</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>

<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Musicians and DJs</a></strong></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4252" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-image-4252 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-9370-2018-battery-test.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 2018 - battery test" width="733" height="550"><p id="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-caption-text">Image by &#8211; forester401 on flickr</p></div>
<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>

<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3971 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="955" height="143" /></p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer is one such company, which has made its name and fame in the gaming laptop segment. The company has been launching powerful gaming laptops in various segments at various price points. Acer’s Predator series of laptops are globally reputed for their performance and power.</p>
<p>With the company launching multiple devices in the gaming laptop market such as the beastly Predator 21X and the sleek and stylish Predator Triton 700, the company has recently updated their already well-known Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop. The 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is a very straightforward, powerful, and no-nonsense gaming laptop. The device carries a lot of USPs with it and offers an improved and powerful gaming performance for the asking price.</p>
<p>Priced at under $1200, the Acer Predator Helios 300 offers all the current generation hardware and the fast refresh-rate display which has made it gain rapid popularity. We spent a good amount of time with the device to test its caliber. And, here is what we think of it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design, there isn’t much of an upgrade here. Having said that, the 2018 Helios 300 looks exactly identical to the last year’s model.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the Helios 300 at the very first glance looks to be much thinner and compact than that of the other laptops in the segment. However, when you hold the device and start using it, you’ll realize that it, in fact, is on a bulkier side. The device comes with a dimension of 10.47 x 15.35 x 1.05 inches, which is a little wider and thicker for a 15-inch laptop. The device weighs slightly over 5.5 pounds and can be quite cumbersome to carry around. However, considering the fact that it is a gaming laptop and has a lot of engineering within, it might not be an issue for most of us.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3939" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Design" width="650" height="406" /></p>
<p>Acer this time has come up with newer color variants, to give gamers a choice. It has unveiled the special edition Acer Predator Helios 300, which comes clad in a white-and-gold chassis. However, we still don&#8217;t know when it will hit the stores.</p>
<p>The one which we tested looks just like its predecessor and has the same angular design going all around with red and black color scheme. Its aluminum lid has a huge Predator logo and a red lining on either side which gives it a proper gaming hue, however, it doesn&#8217;t light up like Alienware and some <a title="All MSI Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/msi-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end MSI laptops</a>.</p>
<p>Most gamers would love the design of this laptop, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an out of the box gaming laptop design, then the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) might not please you that much.</p>
<div id="attachment_3941" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-image-3941 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Lid-design.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 - Lid design" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3941" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Premium looking Metal Lid with Huge Predator Logo and Red Lines on Either Side</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the build quality, there is a lot of plastic used in the making of chassis of this laptop. However, there are no compromises with the build quality and laptop feels very solid to hold. Moreover, it comes with a pretty ergonomic form-factor making it subtle to carry around and use.</p>
<p>As far as ports and slots are concerned, they are neatly recessed on both sides of the laptop and they are smartly placed in a way that wired gaming mouse won&#8217;t hinder your gaming experience.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Almost all the Acer Predator series of laptops come with a short-stroke keyboard, which might not often be preferred for gaming. The keys on the Helios 300, comes with a travel of the only 1.2mm into the frame on a press, which is not much. This affects the tactile feedback on the keyboard. However, this doesn’t hold true for regular usage including documents editing and other general tasks.</p>
<p>However, the gamers will like the keys on the device as they are very brightly backlit and come in non-changeable red color hue to match the styling. The keys come with a slight curve, which adds on to the typing experience nonetheless.</p>

<p>Speaking about the trackpad on the device, it is made out of plastic and evidently, one can feel that right away. Although the tactile feedback and the touch sensitivity on the trackpad are fine-tuned, we felt the lack of richness, we ought to get on gaming laptops over $1000. However, it can still take up all the everyday essentials with ease without dropping a sweat.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD widescreen display and it is an IPS LED-backlit panel. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What makes it unique though is its fast 144Hz refresh rate</span>. Meaning, the rapid refresh rate shortens the time it takes for frame rendering and provides gamers with an excellent in-game experience. This helps especially when you’re gaming or watching the high-quality video files.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3946" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Gaming-Laptop-PH315-51-78NP-144Hz-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop (PH315-51-78NP) 144Hz Display Review" width="900" height="667" /></p>
<p>The display can get bright up to 300 nits and produces a decent 70% NTSC and 90% sRGB color gamut on the scale, making it good enough for content creators. We also played some 4K content on the laptop, and the details were very precise, that we could see every minute detail played.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops for Photo Editing with Most Color Accurate Display</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Overall, the display on the Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) gaming laptop is one of its unique selling points and without a doubt, it is one of the best display-equipped mid-range gaming laptop available to buy right now.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking about the hardware of the device, Acer Predator Helios 300 comes with powerful innards, which makes it one of the latest in the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">segment of mid-range gaming devices</a>.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the device is powered by a latest 8th gen Intel Core i7-8750H hexa-core processor with clock frequency of up to 4.1GHz and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 video memory. The duo of this CPU and GPU makes it one of the most powerful and value for money gaming laptops available for the asking price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops</a> (8th Gen)</strong></em></div></div>
<p>For multitasking, the laptop has a huge 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of PCIe based NVMe SSD. Although this might not be sufficient to store huge data, be mindful, the SSD storage offered in this laptop is at least 4 times faster than that of the traditional HDD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_3947" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Acer-Predator-Helios-300-Hardware-and-Upgradability.jpg" alt="2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-78NP Hardware and Upgradability" width="800" height="546" /><p id="caption-attachment-3947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>New Dual Fan Cooling System | Easy to upgrade RAM (Up to 32GB) and Storage</strong> <em>&#8211; Image taken from Dave Lee YouTube Channel</em></p></div>
<p>To the gamers rejoice, hardware on the Predator Helios 300 is quite easy to upgrade. The laptop&#8217;s back panel gives access to its two RAM slots one of which is empty and it also has an empty storage drive bay inside to upgrade its low storage with the hard drive or another SSD. The WiFi card is also easily accessible but we don&#8217;t think it needs to be changed as the Gigabit card that the laptop comes equipped with, works flawlessly and provides excellent WiFi reception.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being a gaming stationed laptop, we expect a lot of additional peripherals to be connected to the device. Accordingly, the Helios 300 comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C port which can support speeds of up to 5GBps. It also sports a USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports. There is an HDMI 2.0 port to plug in the additional display if needed. The HDMI port available comes with HDCP support. Apart from these, it also comes with a microSD card reader, an RJ45 Ethernet port, headphone jack, and a charging port.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3948" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ports-and-Slots-Acer-Predator-Helios-300-15-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots Acer Predator Helios 300 15-inch Gaming Laptop" width="800" height="367" /></p>
<p>The only disappointment here is its USB Type-C port which doesn&#8217;t support the Thunderbolt 3. We expected this year&#8217;s model with Thunderbolt 3 as the last year&#8217;s model didn&#8217;t had it. However, it isn&#8217;t a huge problem if you don&#8217;t plan to use the External GPU or other Thunderbolt accessories.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We spent a decent time gaming and doing other mediocre to demanding tasks on this laptop. The laptop stood up to the expectations and did well in terms of providing reliable performance and efficiency. We tested the laptop by <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rendering video</a> on the Adobe Premiere and even played some AAA games at high graphics settings. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop was able to handle our multitasking and gaming tests quite easily.</p>
<p>A gaming laptop is often discredited due to its heating issues but to our surprise, this year&#8217;s Acer Predator Helios 300 did well in terms of thermal management, despite having powerful CPU and GPU inside it. Thanks to its new all-metal dual AeroBlade fans and huge exhaust vents at the back, the laptop dissipates all the inside heat out and allows CPU and GPU to work at its full potential.</p>
<p>The data transfer speeds and superfast app loading speeds are yet another impressive aspects of this laptop. Its 256GB PCIe NVME SSD doesn&#8217;t offer adequate room, but it does help in reducing the bootup times and load times of games and other applications.</p>
<p>Speaking about the benchmarks, we ran a couple of benchmark tests on the laptop to find out its actual potential. Accordingly, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (with i7-8750H and GTX 1060) scored a good P13214 on the 3DMark 11 and a 19800 on multi-core and 4560 on single-core tests via Geekbench 4 64-bit. These scores are on par with most of the other offerings in the segment which makes the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) again king of the mid-range gaming laptops segment.</p>

<h4>Gaming</h4>
<p>All credits to the powerful Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics baked in, the Helios 300 does deliver exceptionally well-performance for the mid-range gaming stationed laptop. We had a good time playing games on it and even at the highest graphics settings, laptop managed to deliver the respectable framerates. However, the fans get quite vocal while gaming and its battery lasted for just 58 minutes in our gaming tests.</p>

<p>The laptop also supports virtual reality, but GTX 1060 isn&#8217;t the best GPU you can get for the VR related tasks. We tested its VR capabilities by playing some VR games, and the laptop managed to run all of them. However, the experience wasn&#8217;t the smoothest and GPU did felt a bit underpowered for VR. But, the GPU is overclockable and overclocking does reduce the lag up to an extent.</p>

<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Like the last year&#8217;s model, the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 also comes with the same dual stereo speakers located on the bottom front of the laptop. They are backed by the Acer’s proprietary Acer TruHarmony audio tech and Dolby Audio premium, which claims to enhance the audio quality. However, the audio isn&#8217;t the loudest and its sound gets suppressed due to the bad placement of speakers.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#b3b3b3;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#cdcdcd;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You May Like to Check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life on the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is definitely not the main selling point as it comes with the same 4-cell Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery that we saw in the last year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p>Although the company claims that the laptop can provide up to 7 hours of continuous usage, during our real-time usage, we managed to sustain the battery for close to 4 hours with normal usage. However, while gaming the battery life dropped to a mere 58 minutes which is tad disappointment and less as per the gaming laptop&#8217;s standards of 2018. Moreover, it takes up to two and a half hours to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>So, battery on the new Predator Helios 300 is another thing after design, Acer has used to cut manufacturing costs, and that can be a deal-breaker for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If one is looking for a powerful mid-range gaming laptop, then the 2018 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-51-78NP) is our top pick right now. It checks a lot of right boxes with its segment first 144Hz display, powerful and latest hardware, and a rather old yet good built chassis. However, a bit heavy form factor, small battery and a 256GB of SSD might be a bit of concern for few. But it&#8217;s hard to find an alternative to this laptop, especially for the price that it comes.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15 comes with standard design, which although isn’t ground-breaking in terms of looks, but does give a solid look and feel.</p>
<p>The overall build quality and the chassis made is evidently a considerable improvement over the previously launched Pavilion series of notebooks by the company and comes with a toughed rigidity. The laptop’s edges and corners are stronger, sharper, and well-defined with better finish. Thanks to the improvised look and feel, the laptop feels far more aesthetic and versatile.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3678" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop - Design" width="750" height="484" /></p>
<p>The laptop has been designed and engineered considering the everyday usage. The laptop’s lid lifts the rear base of the laptop for the air flow, which maintains the laptop’s temperature. The display can be tilted to a maximum of <em>150 degrees</em>, which will suffice most of the regular users. Keyboard, trackpad, ports, and other connectivity slots are neatly recessed and are properly placed on the laptop. Both the edges consistently house the ports and other connectivity options.</p>
<p>Dimension wise, the laptop measures 9.93 x 14.88 x 0.95 inches, which is pretty much the norm in a 15-inch laptop. The laptop however, weighs just <strong>4 pounds</strong> which makes it ideal for daily commuters like college students and business people. On an overall, comparative note, the laptop’s dimension and weight are not much different than that of the other notebooks in the segment.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr laptop sports a 15.6-inch diagonal Full HD display. The display comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels and the panel on the device is an IPS WLED-backlit enabled one.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3679" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-Gaming-Laptop-Display.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15 Gaming Laptop - Display Review" width="843" height="633" /></p>
<p>The 1080p IPS display works fine on most of the occasions. It does provide good vibrant color reproduction along with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">178-degree of wide-viewing angles</span>. However, we felt the display tended to be a bit grainy, which could take out the fun while playing games or watching videos at higher resolutions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Laptops with Most Color-Accurate Displays for Photo Editing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, the contrast levels on the laptop, were also a bit behind the competition. The color temperature on the laptop is not overly cool nor is very warm, which is a good thing. It has the right balance of color, which will suffice most of the gamers, and regular users. Backlit is subtle and can provide enough thrust for daylight viewing.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Pavilion Power packs in some robust and powerful innards for the asking price. Speaking about the hardware and specifications, the device packs in a latest 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor. The processor of the device comes with a default clock speed of  2.8GHz, which can go up to 3.8GHz in full throttle.</p>

<p>For multitasking and handling applications, the laptop comes with a 16GB of DDR4 SDRAM. The latest and the spacious 16GB of RAM ensures smoother and efficient performance at faster speeds. For the storage, the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of Serial ATA hard disk drive. The device also comes with a 128GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 solid-state drive. The read and write speeds of SSD are excellent and hard drive used on the laptop is also faster with 7200RPM speed.</p>
<p>As far as graphics are concerned, the laptop comes with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU with 4GB of DDR5 VRAM. So, from specs sheet the laptop looks pretty good but how&#8217;s the real-life performance? More on that later.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr series comes with an all new <span style="text-decoration: underline;">full-size island-style chiclet keyboard</span>. The keyboard is more rigid, and provides better tactile feedback. Although the keys are plastic built, they come with a right concave structure, making typing easy and effective. The keyboard is backlit enabled which comes quite handy.</p>

<p>There are no separate fancy colors for WASD keys though, but that&#8217;s what makes this HP pavilion laptop stand out. Being a professional looking device, this laptop is beast inside and hence, the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best all-purpose laptop in $1000 price range</a> with perfect mixture of work and play.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3680" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-Keyboard-and-Toucpad-review.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="600" height="557" /></p>
<p>The touchpad on the device is also very spacious and comes with a proper surface area to suffice all the gestures and inputs. Moreover, it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">chrome-trimmed trackpad</span>, giving it a rich feel while using.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15 comes with an <strong>integrated 720p HD web camera</strong>. The device’s camera can aid in video callings but cannot suffice someone who will use this as a means of capturing images. Although the device can capture images, the results might be a tad disappointing. There is evident visual noise in the images and they appear to be a bit blurry. However, the image gets adjusted quite well to the frame, and the camera’s reception rates are acceptable.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with all the set of ports and input slots, one would expect from a laptop. It comes with a pair of USB 3.1 Gen 1 Ports, an audio jack and kensington lock on left hand side and on right hand side there is one USB Type-C 3.1 Gen 1 port, one USB 3.1 Gen 1 port, RJ-45 port, an HDMI port, and a media card reader.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3681 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-Power-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="1500" height="570" /></p>
<p>The ports selection on the laptop is very good and you would never run out of ports with this laptop but we think that the ports are aligned slightly close to each other and that might be problematic while connecting thumb drives to adjacent USB ports.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr laptop runs Windows 10 out of the box which is pretty much a norm, when it comes to gaming-stationed laptops. It has a large application market, and an even larger user base, making it an ideal choice for every gaming laptop.</p>
<p>As far as bloatware is concerned, the HP Pavilion Power 15 does come with some softwares pre-installed but some of them are useful. However, they can be uninstalled pretty easily and you can enjoy pure Windows experience with this laptop.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Thanks to the stellar set of specifications, the laptop offers, the performance on this device is not a compromise by any means. That said, the device delivers, powerful performance and can keeps up with all the multitasking demands of the users.</p>
<p>We tested the laptop in its full throttle by throwing multiple heavy applications at it. Thankfully, the laptop handled multiple apps exceptionally well. We were watching 4K content on the laptop, with multiple applications including benchmarks, chrome with almost 15 tabs open, and more, to which the laptop responded really well.</p>

<p>We did not had any issue in using the laptop as the primary work machine. The spacious keyboard and the trackpad helped us stay productive with the works. All the connectivity options provided with the laptop worked like a charm with no hassles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3682 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HP-Pavilion-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop Review - Gaming performance" width="700" height="455" /></p>
<p>We ran a couple of benchmarking tests to determine the power and performance of the device. The laptop gave very adequate benchmarking scores, easily topping the lists of most of the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other gaming laptops under $1000</a>.</p>
<p>We also did a couple of other performance tests including the data transfer rate tests, to which the laptop gave amazing results. Thanks to its combination of HDD+SSD, the device was able to achieve very good data transfer rates.</p>
<h4>Gaming Performance</h4>
<p>As far as the gaming on this HP Pavilion is concerned, the integrated <strong>4GB of GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 TI graphics coprocessor</strong> is a show-stealer here.</p>
<p>Being a primarily gaming-stationed laptop, the HP Pavilion 15-cb079nr laptop can handle almost all the modern games with ease even with the graphics set to mid-high level settings. To test its 3D rendering strength, we ran 3D Mark on the device, and the laptop scored a decent <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8800 points</span></strong>.</p>
<p>However, do not expect the buttery smooth gaming experience from demanding games at highest graphics settings. So on a conclusive note, users will be satisfied with the gaming performance of the device, if they keep their expectations in check. We played a couple of modern games including the GTA V on highest graphic mode and the laptop did well.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The HP Pavilion Power 15’s speakers aren’t very powerful. But, they are subtle enough to give a good audio and listening experience. The device comes with dual Speakers, which are internally tuned by <em><strong>B&amp;O PLAY</strong></em> for better audio output. Moreover, the laptop comes with the company’s proprietary <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HP Audio Boost technology</span> for better audio at various presets.</p>
<p>As far as video experience is concerned, the laptop’s full HD display can handle almost all the content you throw at it. Be it 4K, UHD, Full HD, or HD, we had good time watching video content on the laptop. But, as we mentioned earlier the display is bit grainy and it isn&#8217;t the brightest to use easily in the daylight conditions.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The company claimed that the laptop can provide a battery backup of up to 11 hours on a single charge, which is very huge for any gaming laptop. However, when we put the laptop to test, it provided us an endurance period of about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7-8 hours on a single charge</span></strong>, which is still pretty commendable for a gaming laptop. The device is powered by a lithium-ion polymer battery, which <em>takes just 1 hour for a full charge from 0 to 100</em> which is again an added advantage of this laptop. So, battery life is where this laptop shines and stands out in the segment and we would like to applaud HP for that.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3135 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HP-15-cb079nr-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr Gaming Laptop Review" width="550" height="359" /></p>
<p>HP Pavilion Power 15-cb079nr is unarguably one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best value-for-money gaming laptop in sub-$1000 segment</strong></span>. The laptop has got able hardware paired with decent specs. Although the laptop lags slightly behind the competition in terms of display quality and audio output, its performance, built, and battery life makes it a very worthy buy.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>MSI is not just known for their powerful innards and gaming performance, the devices are globally-reputed for their beautifully crafted aesthetics and design which compliments gamers.</p>
<p>Speaking of our current device, the MSI GL62M 7REX uses the same case and design as most of its predecessors. The only difference being, the laptop is considerably slimmer and light weighed when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<div id="attachment_3376" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-image-3376 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Slim-and-Lightweight-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Slim and Lightweight Gaming Laptop" width="650" height="242" /><p id="caption-attachment-3376" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin and Light for Gaming on-the-go</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, the lightweight and portability are achieved on the cost of an optical drive, which the device lacks. The body of the device comes with a matte-finished plastic chassis with a bright red accent on the rear, which goes all the way to the dual fan grilles. The device comes with the dimension 15.1 x 10.2 x 1.1 inches which is pretty much the norm for 15.6-inched laptops.</p>
<p>On an overall note, the design of the device is pretty stylish, compact, slim, and easy to carry. Moreover, the device gives you that perfect mean-for-gaming hue by all the means. With this laptop, the company seems to aim at achieving portability by attaining the slim chassis and at a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thickness of 1.06 inches with weight just over 5.29 pounds</span>, the MSI GL62M 7REX gaming laptop is extremely portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M comes with a 15.6&#8243; Full HD eDP matte-finished display. The display on the devices holds a resolution of 1920-by-1080 pixels which is powered by In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology. It is due to this, the display provides wide-viewing angles.</p>

<p>The device comes with <strong>94% NTSC color range</strong>, which means, the device is capable of delivering very competent color reproduction which makes this laptop also an <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent choice for photo editing</a>. Of course, this better color gamut complements the gaming on MSI GL62M 7REX, which we personally experienced and liked. The blacks are punchy and the panel is bright enough even for outdoor usage. We did not feel any fatigue even after using the laptop for prolonged durations, which is an excellent thing to consider for the gaming laptops.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>MSI GL62M comes with a very powerful and able set of specifications and hardware, which bolsters its brand reputation. MSI, being one of the world-renowned gaming laptop manufacturers delivers powerful machines with futuristic tech to meet the audience&#8217;s requirements.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>

The laptop&#8217;s webcam can although meet the basic requirements of video calling but provides pixelated images, when clicked. Thankfully, the device adjusts the picture on frame quickly and has a decent frame rate, when it comes to the videos being captured or streamed for a video call through the webcam.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the gaming performance of the laptop, let&#8217;s first speak about its everyday-performance. Thanks to its powerful innards, the laptop can pretty much handle everything you throw at it. However, RAM at times might be a hinder for heavy applications. On the other hand, the graphics processing abilities of this laptop are simply impeccable and here is what we felt after an extensive usage of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3387" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MSI-GL62M-7REX-1896US-Gaming-Laptop-Performance-Review.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US Gaming Laptop - Performance Review" width="650" height="469" /></p>
<p>During our usage, we didn&#8217;t feel or notice any considerable heating issues neither did we face any connectivity issues. The laptop was able to handle heavy applications such as Photoshop, Maya, and more. We also put the laptop to extensive multitasking which was also very well handled by the laptop.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Video Editing of 2018</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For any gaming laptop, the GPU is probably the most crucial aspect. Accordingly, our current contender packs in a latest <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of GDDR5 memory</span></strong>. This series of graphics cards from NVIDIA is the top-of-the-line pascal architecture graphic processors. Although being the latest in the iteration, the graphics card isn&#8217;t the best of the gaming processors out there. Keeping in mind that the <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop falls under $1000 price bracket</a>, MSI GL62M 7REX will satisfy most of the professional gamers.</p>
<p>This mid-range gaming laptop is powerful enough to handle almost any high-end game you throw at it. However, you might have to at times, set the graphics quality to mid-range for the better experience. We ran a couple of benchmarks on the device and all the numbers satisfied us. We ran 3D Mark on this device, to which the laptop responded well and scored over 9300 points. We also ran a bunch of top games to provide our readers with the real-time usage scenarios. In its ultra-mode, which is especially meant for power gaming, the device managed to achieve commendable frame rates in various games, which are as follows:</p>
<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><div class="vc_progress_bar wpb_content_element  vc_progress-bar-color-bar_grey"><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Overwatch <span class="vc_label_units">75 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="75" data-value="75"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">COD - Infinity Warfare <span class="vc_label_units">59 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="59" data-value="59"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">DOOM <span class="vc_label_units">68 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="68" data-value="68"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Gears of War 4 <span class="vc_label_units">61 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="61" data-value="61"></span></div><div class="vc_general vc_single_bar vc_progress-bar-color-bar_green"><small class="vc_label">Battlefield <span class="vc_label_units">60 FPS in Ultra Settings</span></small><span class="vc_bar " data-percentage-value="60" data-value="60"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>On a conclusive note, the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US ticks all the boxes right and does well in the segments in which it is primarily meant to serve in.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 &#8211; Top 10 High-Performance Laptops</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The MSI GL62M&#8217;s audio is pumped by the company&#8217;s proprietary <strong>Nahimic 2 technology</strong>. This is an Audio Enhancement tech, which provides powerful audio without compromising on the details. During our review, the audio from the laptop generating was great. Especially, the depths of audio, while playing games made us feel the gaming environment around us. With this laptop, the users can get the most of 3D sound enhancement of the virtual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7.1 surround sound</span> while reducing external noise.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, thanks to its bright display and graphics abilities, the laptop can play all formats of video content with ease.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is vital. However, in the case of gaming laptops, battery life cannot be expected to provide any wonders. That said, the MSI GL62M lasted for about 4 hours on our rundown tests, which included continuous heavy usage and multitasking. Although this is pretty much what we get of a gaming laptop, we certainly expected that the battery would last longer at least by an hour. The addition of heat pipes and dual cooling systems might be the reason for the high battery usage.</p>
<p>The laptop takes about two and half hours for it to get completely charged form 0 to 100. Again, if we&#8217;re speaking about this in a gaming laptop&#8217;s perspective, then the MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US gaming laptop will satisfy most, if not all.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3344" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/msi-gl62m-7rex-1896us-156-full-hd-gaming-laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GL62M 7REX-1896US 15.6&quot; Full HD Gaming Laptop" width="500" height="290" /></p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the laptop at this price is definitely a very decent buy. However, if you&#8217;re not a complete gamer, then we&#8217;d recommend you to switch to another other device in the price range to get a better RAM, and battery backup. All the gamers, need to keep in mind that this device is a mid-range gaming laptop to keep their expectations in check. That said, the laptop still has a lot of amazing specs and features such as a bright display, powerful audio, very sturdy performance, and amazing look and aesthetics.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Asus ROG Strix GL553VD comes in a furious looking blend of black and orange coloured chassis, which gives it all the necessary gaming look, one would expect from a gaming laptop. The laptop is made up of all plastic chassis, which, however, feels of superior quality and feels sturdy. The laptop’s lid sports a pair of orange strips running across the ROG logo, which gives a slightly different look from its predecessors. The bottom of the laptop comes with rubber feet, to give an extra grip even at inclined and smooth surfaces.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2096" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD Gaming Laptop Build Quality Review" width="600" height="547" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review-300x274.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Build-Quality-Review-50x46.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking of the measurements and weight of the laptop, it weighs around 5.5 pounds and comes with dimensions of 15.1 x 10 x 1.2 inches. The laptop measures just like any of the usual 15.6-inch laptop in the market. As per the measurements, the laptop isn&#8217;t heavy or bulky to carry around. However, that said, it&#8217;s not pretty light either.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD - Thinness" width="600" height="622" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-289x300.jpg 289w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Thinness-48x50.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Speaking about the alignment of ports on the laptop, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, and a couple of USB 3.0 ports, a USB type-C port, and a headphone jack on the left end. Towards the right end, it comes with a single USB 2.0 port, a DVD drive, and a locking slot. The laptop comes with an SD card reader towards the lower end of the keyboard and is located just beneath the palm rest.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the GL553VD is a completely redesigned one. It is now a RGB lighting keyboard which Asus calls it as a <em>Aura lighting keyboard</em>. The lights on the keyboard can be customised through the pre-installed Asus keyboard color adjustment software. As far as typing is concerned, the keys on keyboard are spacious and gives very nice tactile feedback while typing. The key travel distance is also 2.5mm which is standard and good for the &#8220;gaming laptop&#8217;s keyboard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Overall, the all-matte black finish on the laptop makes this laptop look extremely stylish and thanks to its well-built ergonomics, the laptop feels easy to hold and carry around.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD gaming laptop sports a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS-like display panel and comes with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. The laptop comes with a wide view of 178 degrees, which we felt was pretty good in the real time usage. Moreover, the panel gets equipped with a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is also a good aspect for a laptop this calibre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2100" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-image-2100 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Display Review" width="600" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Display-Review-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100" class="wp-caption-text">15.6 Inch Full HD Matte Finish 178 Degree Wide View Display</p></div>
<p>The blacks on the display were punchy, and almost all the colours were pretty accurate. The display on the laptop has got the right amount of contrasts, one would be needing in gaming and other viewing experiences. The best part about the display we felt during the review was the colour consistency which was pretty uniform even from extreme positions. And although the laptop doesn&#8217;t come with an anti-glare coating, it does resist reflections and glare on the screen. These aspects of the display qualifies this <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/">laptop for photo editing</a> and also for other works where color accuracy of the display is  important.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a 17-inch variant of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL753VD</em> which comes with exactly the same specs as this laptop but it sports a bigger 17.3 inch display. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a bigger laptop to play games then you can go with GL753VD, which will cost you around $30 bucks more than the current model. | <a title="Recommended Laptop Retailer - Amazon.com" href="http://amzn.to/2mcYSJj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL753VD 17.3 Inch Gaming Laptop</strong></em></a>.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Now with all that said about the design and display of this power-packed gaming laptop, let&#8217;s dive into the hardware specifications of the Strix GL553VD. Speaking about the innards of this laptop, the ASUS ROG Strix comes with an equally powerful set of hardware configuration. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th gen intel core i7 processor paired with an abundant 16GB of RAM. The quad-core i7 kaby lake processor is clocked at 2.8GHz and can turbo boost up to 3.8GHz, making sure that, multiple demanding applications run on the laptop with ease. Graphics on the laptop are bolstered and are handled really well by newer Pascal based NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card.</p>
<div id="attachment_2101" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-image-2101 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD Hardware Review" width="600" height="360" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-300x180.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Hardware-Review-50x30.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101" class="wp-caption-text">Next-Generation Performance | New NVidia GeForce GTX Pascal Based Graphics &amp; Kaby Lake CPU</p></div>
<p>As far as the storage on the laptop is concerned, it is backed by a 1TB of HDD with a speed of 7200RPM. The laptop also comes with a DVD drive to read and write CD/DVDs. Upgrading this laptop is also fairly easy. The RAM is easily accessible and it can be upgraded up to 32GB. Even storage drive of this laptop can be upgraded but that is the little complicated process and you may void the warranty if you do this on your own.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another model of this laptop &#8211; <em>Asus ROG Strix GL553VE</em> which has slightly more powerful GPU and faster SSD storage. To be accurate, it has powerful NVidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti Graphics and it offers 1TB of 7200RPM hard drive and an extra 256GB of SSD storage which vastly improves the gaming performance of the laptop. Of-course, this added performance will come by spending some extra money! | <strong><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2naefqf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><em>Checkout price of Asus ROG Strix GL553VE Gaming Laptop</em></a></strong>.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<div id="attachment_2102" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-image-2102 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg" alt="Asus ROG STRIX GL553VD - Webcam" width="600" height="247" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-300x124.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-STRIX-GL553VD-Webcam-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2102" class="wp-caption-text">With HD Webcam You Can Stream Your Game Play with Friends or on YouTube</p></div>
<p>We never focus a primary light on this aspect of a laptop, especially if it is a gaming-stationed one. However, we understand that the webcam on a laptop should be serviceable for occasional video calls. Thankfully, the 720p camera on the Strix manages to take decent images and is pretty serviceable for video calls. However, the images captured are not very sharp and tends to get blurry at times. The image adjusts quickly on the screen, which we felt was very good for video calling.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<div id="attachment_2104" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-image-2104 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots.jpg" alt="Asus ROG GL553VD Ports &amp; Slots" width="700" height="209" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots.jpg 700w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-300x90.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-610x182.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-600x179.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-ROG-GL553VD-Ports-Slots-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2104" class="wp-caption-text">Reversible USB Type-C Port with Hyper Fast Data Transfer Speeds</p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a long list of ports and connectivity options to accommodate additional peripherals (gaming accessories). It sports a couple of USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port. In addition to that, it comes with an ethernet port, an HDMI port, a <strong>USB Type-C port</strong>, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Unlike most of the current laptops, it comes with a DVD drive, which read/writes data from DVDs and CDs. The laptop also houses an SD card slot to transfer files back and forth between memory card and laptop.</p>
<h4>Software</h4>
<p>Asus has preloaded its Strix laptop with the right fusion of gaming beneficiary software, which is high on productivity and gaming aspects. The laptop comes with Windows 10 preloaded on the software front, and also comes equipped with the ASUS&#8217;s proprietary ROG gaming centre.</p>
<p>This gives games a whole new level of overall performance increase and also keeps the laptop’s temperature in control even after heavy gaming. The ROG gaming centre properly utilises the CPU and GPU performances and provides the most of the both. In addition to this, this laptop also includes alternatives to boost up the exhaust speeds and disable the Windows key during gaming.</p>
<p>The laptop comes preloaded with almost all the Windows 10 apps and features and is, therefore, an equally able laptop in terms of overall productivity.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best All-Purpose Laptops Under $1000</a></strong></p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD comes with a fully-loaded future-proof set of specifications and hardware. So evidently, we expect top class performance from the laptop. We put this laptop to test, to check out whether it can really provide us with the performance we expect from a gaming beast of this calibre. And here is what we found:</p>
<p>The laptop runs absolutely smooth and does a great job in multitasking. During our entire review, we never faced any performance related hiccups, and the laptop was able to handle almost everything we threw at it. Thanks to its latest 7th gen Intel core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM, the Strix delivers impeccable performance. We multitasked the laptop with Chrome running around 15 tabs simultaneously, a 4K video running in the background, a benchmarking app loaded and was connected to WiFI all the time. The laptop was able to handle them all with ease.</p>
<p>For the overall performance of the laptop, we tested it with Geekbench 3, in which the laptop notched a score of 14,120, which is absolutely great for a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming laptop priced $1000</a>. As far as the gaming is concerned, the in-house 4GB of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU is a show-stealer here. The laptop can handle almost all the modern games even the graphics set to maximum. However, you&#8217;ll feel that smooth lag-free gaming with more than 35-40fps when you play them with graphics set to medium. We played GTA V on high graphics mode and the laptop although responded very well to the games, we personally felt that it did a better job when graphics were set to medium.</p>
<p>All that said, The ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD unarguably provides a beastly performance for the asking price.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop easily handled almost all formats of video content. We tested it with 4K, Full HD, and HD videos and the Strix GL553VD handled them all with ease. However, it was the audio quality, which failed to reach our expectations. The audio felt muffled at times and was not detailed on the notes. At maximum volume, we felt a crackling like sounds, which disappointed us.</p>
<div id="attachment_2106" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106" class="wp-image-2106 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review.jpg" alt="Asus GL553VD Speakers Review" width="750" height="517" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-300x207.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-610x420.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-600x414.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asus-GL553VD-Speakers-Review-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106" class="wp-caption-text">Loud Speakers for Immersive In-Game Audio</p></div>
<p>Audio on the laptop is also a bit thin and weak when compared to its rivals in the price segment. However, the sound output on the laptop is still serviceable. Thanks to the preinstalled ICEpower AudioWizard software programs tuning audio was easy.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Like most of the gaming laptops these days, ASUS ROG Strix GL553VD also comes with a pretty mediocre battery life, and you&#8217;ll have to carry your power adapter if you take Strix anywhere out. The laptop is powered by a non-removable 4-cells 48 WHr battery, which lasted for just over 4 hours for us on our usage. This included casual web browsing, online videos streaming, few benchmarking apps, and some gaming. The laptop takes around 3 hours to get fully charged from 0 to 100. All in all, the battery backup of this laptops isn&#8217;t groundbreaking and is strictly average. We seriously felt this was an area the laptop was lagging behind its rivals to an extent.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2041 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000.jpg" alt="Asus ROG Strix GL553VD Gaming Laptop Full In depth Review" width="500" height="365" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000.jpg 500w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000-300x219.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ROG-Strix-GL553VD-Gaming-Laptop-Under-1000-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />Keeping it very simple, the Asus ROG Strix GL553VD is a very attractive looking gaming laptop with punchy aesthetics and powerful hardware. The laptop also provides very good performance and gaming experience. The only aspects which are a let down in this laptop are its battery life and audio output. However, on an overall note, the laptop is a complete show stealer, when compared to its rivals and is, therefore, our choice of gaming laptop if your budget is around $1000.</p>
