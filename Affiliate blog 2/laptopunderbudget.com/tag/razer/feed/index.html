										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want a laptop that is thin, light, has a premium build, quad-core processor and dedicated graphics then a MacBook Pro is what comes to mind, but even when you spend $1800, you do not get the dedicated graphics. That is where the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth comes in and checks all those boxes.</p>
<p>The Blade Stealth has been on the market for some time now and each year Razer introduces some tweaks to make it better. While it was always a thin and light laptop, it was never considered a gaming PC without the Razer core external GPU enclosure that costs extra.</p>
<p>While the base model does still come with an integrated graphics, you can get the mid-range version that offers a quad-core CPU and the Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics. While the performance might not be on par with the <a title="Razer Blade 15 Gets Affordable Base Model and New White Color Option" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/razer-blade-15-gets-affordable-model-new-white-color-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently launched 15-inch model</a>, it is still much better than the Intel&#8217;s integrated graphics. One thing to note here is that this is not the standard MX150 GPU, but a powerful version that has a 25W TDP and comes with 4GB of GDDR5 memory. This provides some serious on-the-go gaming and video editing performance.</p>
<p>Fortnite can be played at 1080p on the medium preset with 45-60 FPS on average. Call of Duty Black Ops 4 is also playable if you lower the graphics to the low preset. The game runs at 45-50 FPS and you could get stable 60 FPS if you lowered the resolution even further.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4748" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gaming-on-2019-Razer-Blade-Stealth.jpg" alt="Gaming on 2019 Razer Blade Stealth" width="750" height="580" /></p>
<p>The new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth is powered by the new Intel Whiskey Lake i7-8565U processor and it can be configured with up to 16GB of 2133 MHz RAM and 512GB of PCIe M.2 SSD. The new model is better than ever with smaller display bezels, which means that the entire laptop is a little less wide. The Matte Black aluminum finish on the 2019 Stealth is similar to the other Razer laptops, and it is the only color option available right now.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the laptop build quality feels so good is that it is built from a single block of Aluminum. Removing a single screw gets you to the internals of the laptop. There is not much that you can upgrade but you can change the SSD if you want. Inside you see a new thermal design that comes with dual fans to cool the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth that now comes with a dedicated GPU.</p>
<p>The 52Wh battery might not be the biggest in the world but Razer does claim that it will last up to 13 hours which is very impressive indeed. This will depend on the type of work that you are doing on the device, but it should last you 8 hours on average.</p>
<p>The price of the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth is pretty high and the mid-range version <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-stealth/shop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">costs you $1600</a>. This is still cheaper when compared to the MacBook and better than the <a title="Dell XPS 13 (2018) Review – Best Windows Ultrabook Money can Buy" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/dell-xps-13-2018-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell&#8217;s XPS 13</a> which doesn&#8217;t come with dedicated GPU at all.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for a new thin and light laptop that does not compromise on power then the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth is a great option to consider. Especially if you are looking for a Windows device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn&#8217;t absolutely love the Razer Blade 15? A 15.6 inch widescreen, super slim bezels, a powerful i7 processor and an amazing 4K display. What&#8217;s not to like? Ah yes, the $2599 price tag. While I mostly write about the upgrades and boosts in the gadgets, this one is actually a refresh but to a lower end model. Seems like Razer has finally come to terms with the fact that as perfect as their Razer Blade 15 might be, it just isn&#8217;t for everyone.</p>
<p>For tightly budgeted gamers, Razer has introduced an affordable remake of the &#8220;smallest 15.6 gaming laptop ever&#8221; that is available for $1599.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>The new Razer Blade 15 &#8220;Dual Storage Model&#8221; gets the name from an added SSD and a traditional hard drive, so you now get two storage options. This may not sound like a new innovation, but considering that the said feature is mostly found in bulkier, more sturdy machines, it&#8217;s a commendable addition. It is also appreciable that Razer has maintained the slim body of its Razer blade along with the added storage options.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“We listened to feedback from our fans and we have expanded on that experience with a new color option, Ethernet capability, more storage configurations and a more affordable price.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Said Razer Co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan.</p>
<div id="attachment_4308" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4308" class="wp-image-4308 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Razer-Blade-15-Fall-2018-Base-Model.png" alt="Razer Blade 15 Fall 2018 Base Model" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-4308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Razer Blade 15 &#8211; New Base Model</strong></p></div>
<p>Here are the major upgrades that Razer has incorporated in this device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual storage configuration with an M.2 SSD + 2.5-inch HDD</li>
<li>A new single-zone RGB keyboard that supports full key backlighting Powered by Razer Chroma</li>
<li>A Gigabit Ethernet port for enhanced connectivity</li>
<li>A bespoke heat pipe thermal management system</li>
<li>A matte Mercury White limited edition with faster screen, more storage and more powerful GPU option</li>
</ul>
<p>The option for storage configurations grants users the freedom to use both an m.2 SSD and a 2.5-inch hard drive. Both components can be upgraded along with the 16GB of RAM that can be expanded to 32GB.</p>
<h3>Falloffs</h3>
<p>But of course, Razer didn&#8217;t manage to cut down the price without taking away some of the good stuff. The base model is a little thicker, heavier and has lost some of the high-end hardware of the Razer Blade 15. Apparently, Razer has removed the 144Hz display and vapor cooling chamber and replaced it with a unibody fan exhaust (cooling pipe), giving the device a larger footprint.</p>
<p>They have also gone back to the old ways with Chroma backlighting technique that still has in-game lightings, but drops the ability to control different areas separately. So the function keys are backlit as well. Moreover, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q GPU has been traded with the GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU in the base model. The newer model also restricts you to a full HD (1920 x 1080) panel with a 60-Hertz refresh rate instead of the 4K (3840 x 2160) display of the predecessor Blade. While this might not have the same high pixel density of the premium models, but the screen is still quite beautiful and you should be able to enjoy games without complaining at least about the display.</p>
<h3>The Limited Edition Razer Blade 15 &#8216;Mercury White&#8217;</h3>
<div id="attachment_4312" style="width: 752px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4312" class="wp-image-4312 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Razer-Blade-15-Mercury-White-Limited-Edition.jpg" alt="Razer Blade 15 - Mercury White Limited Edition" width="742" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-4312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>&#8220;Mercury White&#8221; Razer Blade 15 &#8211; Limited Edition</strong></p></div>
<p>Along with the pocket-friendly version of the Razer Blade 15, the company has tried to spice up the original series too. The thinner, better version of the Blade will now come in &#8220;Mercury White&#8221;. A limited edition version of the laptop that packs the premium hardware in a classy almost greyish tone and un-lit Razer logo on the lid. That is a change of taste from their traditional gunmetal grey.</p>
<p>Razer says the laptops will be available in limited quantities later this year during Q4 direct from Razer US, Canada and China. Material White features the originals&#8217; powerful specs of the Razer Blade and can be coupled with either a GeForce GTX 1060 Max-Q for $2,200, while upgrading to a GeForce GTX 1070 Max-Q raises the price to $2,600. The base model will cost $1599 or $1799 depending on your preference for storage configuration.</p>
