										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Dell&#8217;s subsidiary, Alienware, was focused on making headlines, Dell decided to appeal more to the mass consumer at CES 2019, announcing a refresh to their budget-friendly G series gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The next-generation laptops, the Dell G5 15, G7 15 and G7 17, are set to receive upgrades to both its internal components and aesthetics, with the more affordable line of gaming laptops starting to look more like their Alienware cousins.</p>
<h2>Affordability and Power Packed In a 15-inch Chassis</h2>
<div id="attachment_5155" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-image-5155 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>Where most refreshes only touch up on the hardware side of things, Dell also changed up the aesthetics of their G series gaming laptops for 2019. Instead of their more subtle look, they&#8217;re starting to look more like <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/alienware-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware laptops</a>. Case in point, by default, the Dell G7 15 and G5 15 will both come in Deep Space Black color options, decked out with blue-colored accents. Finally, rounding out its look are ridges located right around the border, which Dell presumably put both for aesthetic and functional purposes.</p>
<p>Another laptop, the Dell G5 15 SE, is also available as an upgrade. It features the same specs as the Dell G5 15. However, it comes with an Alpine White chassis and a clear panel on the bottom of the system that showcases the cooling system, which Dell equipped with blue fans.</p>
<p>The key difference between the G5 15 and the G7 15 is that the latter is thinner and weighs less. At just 0.78 inches and 5.77 pounds, the Dell G7 15 has slightly different dimensions compared to the Dell G5 15, which tips the scales at 6.1 pounds and is at least 0.95 inches thick.</p>
<p>Both of these G series gaming laptops come packing with the latest Quad- and Hex-core Cofee Lake Intel processors, as well as mobile versions of NVIDIA&#8217;s RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can opt to upgrade the display of the latest G series gaming laptops. For more eye candy, users can choose a 4K UHD, OLED display. Meanwhile, for serious and competitive gamers, the G5 15 and the G7 15 comes with a 144Hz Full HD display panel as well.</p>
<h2>An Inexpensive i9-Powered, 17-inch Laptop That Packs a Wallop</h2>
<div id="attachment_5156" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-image-5156 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-3.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>From the more budget friendly G series gaming laptops, we go to the slightly more expensive, but still affordable, G7 17.</p>
<p>Weighing at 7.21 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Dell G7 17 is slightly bigger than its 15-inch brothers. Yet, at the same time, it&#8217;s also leaner compared to <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other 17-inch gaming laptops</a>. It also comes with the same Deep Space Black theme as its 15-inch varieties, and unfortunately, won&#8217;t be available in Alpine White.</p>
<p>Powered by the latest Intel Core i9 processor, the G7 17 is dramatically more powerful and faster compared to the G5 15 and the G7 15. However, other specifications, including the NVIDIA RTX graphics cards, which tops out with the RTX 2080, remains the same across all three (or four including the G5 15 SE) gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dell has limited the 17-inch laptop to a Full HD display. However, users can choose to have it equipped with a 144Hz screen for a smoother gameplay experience.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Dell announced that all of the refreshed G series gaming laptops will start shipping on January 21.</p>
<p>The Dell G5 15 will start at $999, with the thinner and lighter Dell G7 15 starting at $1,099, and the Alpine White Dell G5 15 SE being available as an upgrade option. Finally, the Dell G7 17 will start at a $1,379 price point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the XPS 13 as Dell came out with the fundamental model back in 2015. While the overall machine was great, the users criticized the notebook on its one particular trait — the placement of the webcam. There is hardly anyone out there who is not a sucker for slim bezels. But back in 2015, apparently, it meant relocating the camera to an inconvenient and unflattering position.</p>
<p>Well, it is 2019 now, and Dell has started the year by addressing this particular ailment and fixing the webcam issue. Instead of opting for a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-notebook-worlds-slimmest-bezels-zenbook-s13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push-open notch like ASUS</a>, Dell has worked on making the camera so tiny that you barely see it there. Dell says that they took their inspiration from the smartphones guidebook and opted the &#8216;active alignment technology,&#8217; that is a first for PC cameras.</p>
<div id="attachment_5131" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5131" class="size-full wp-image-5131" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Dell-XPS-13-9380-2019.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 9380 - 2019" width="828" height="580" /><p id="caption-attachment-5131" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>The new and improved XPS 13 (9380) was unveiled at CES 2019. Dell has made upgrades in other areas of the laptop as well, but the webcam fix remains the most mentionable one. Inside this svelte package, you will find the new 8th generation Whiskey Lake quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, with baser i5 and i3 options as well. There is also up to 16GB of memory, a 256 GB PCIe storage, and a glamorous  4K (3840 x 2160) touchscreen. You can also trade the touch display for a lower price with lower end specs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Buying Guide</a></strong></p>
<p>Dell might have salvaged the webcam while putting slim bezels in, but there is so much they can do. Now users have to rely on the fingerprint login instead of Windows Hello, which is a small sacrifice to make for the slim and glamorous design.</p>
<p>Dell promises a much stronger, reliable and powerful performance with the specs bump and it seems believable as well, but the claim for battery standup &#8211; not so much. The XPS 13 9380 is said to deliver 21 hours of standup on a single charge, but we won&#8217;t get too carried away until the ultrabooks are put to the test properly.</p>
<p>Dell released silver-on-black and rose gold-on-white colors with 4K touch displays while the silver-on-black option with a long-awaited Full HD touch display will be available sometime in the coming months. There&#8217;s also a new frost white color option added by Dell which comes with similar fiberglass palm rest area as the rose gold color option. It will be available with full HD non-touch and 4K touch display in few weeks.</p>
<p>These futuristic-looking ultrabooks are available starting today and are already up for sale on the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/laptops/new-13-9380/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell website</a>. Prices start from $882 to $1823 with various specs and features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have forever been hearing about laptops that are slimmer, smaller, and flexible, often forgetting there is an entire line of users with quite different needs. Dell has just come around and updated their Latitude range to include sturdy laptop designs fitting those peculiar needs. These beasts are solely for industrial and military uses.</p>
<p>The laptops are able to withstand harsh atmospheres and extreme temperatures without bending or breaking. Basically, every abuse that is possible in the field that a normal computer would not be able to survive. The line is aimed at the unsung heroes like military soldiers and firefighters, also for professionals working in factories, construction sites, offshore oil-rigs, doctors and scientists in disaster-relief situations. Basically for every use that has a high probability of causing mechanical failures or has a threat of damaging delicate machinery.</p>
<h3>How is it &#8216;Rugged&#8217;?</h3>
<p>According to Dell, the reason behind choosing their Latitude line to include enterprise machines is because it is their only range that came closest to the configurations of its Rugged and Extreme laptops. The outcome is basically powerhouses, ready to bear drops, extreme temperatures, and rain. Dell is kind of hoping to corner the market with a set of buff laptops able to be reliable no matter the conditions.</p>
<p>Engineers, professionals, and army men are free to bring these into the harshest of conditions with dust, water, snow or even give it a few good bumps and drops without the fear of damaging an expensive gear. Another useful addition is the interchangeable dual batteries. They are practical in a way that a few fully charged lithium-ion batteries can be carried to the site and swapped when a charging port is not nearby which happens often on the fields.</p>
<h2>New Models and Specifications</h2>
<p>Dell&#8217;s Latitude lineup now includes the Latitude 7424 Rugged Extreme, the Latitude 5424 and 5420. These models are following up to the predecessors 5414 and 7414 models. Now, in terms of performance, the new additions models are more or less the same but do come in various hardware configurations. The new 5420, 5424, and 7424 machines boasts latest Intel 8th generation processors and durable builds. The models, however, vary in form factor, resilience and durability.</p>
<h3>The Latitude 7424 Rugged Extreme</h3>
<p>The Rugged Extreme Latitude 7424 model, for instance, is capable of handling more tough situations compared to the 5424 model. The 5420 model is about adding a hint of portability along with resilience and ruggedness than an average machine.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Rugged Extreme&#8217; takes the cake with Intel&#8217;s 8th Generation vPro processors, and a range of supported Wi-Fi connectivity. The 7424 can also be paired with a Snapdragon X20 LTE modem to maintain connectivity even in remote or outlandish areas. It poises up to 4TB of SSD storage, up to 32GB of RAM, a 51 Whr primary battery and an option to hot-swap in a second battery.</p>
<p>The screen, sized to 14-inch and anti-glare, comes with 1080p resolution and up to 1000-nits of brightness so it stays lit enough to be visible in direct sunlight.  A touch panel works with those gigantic gloves we see firemen wearing. The graphics are powered by Intel&#8217;s integrated chips &#8211; with optional AMD Radeon 540 and RX540.</p>
<div id="attachment_4436" style="width: 975px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4436" class="wp-image-4436 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-Latitude-7424-Rugged.jpg" alt="Dell Latitude 7424 Extreme Rugged Testing" width="965" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-4436" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>New Dell Latitude 7424 Rugged | Image &#8211; Dell</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The Rugged Extreme&#8217;s atmosphere withstanding capabilities are outstanding. The heavy-duty beasts are able to operate in temperatures ranging from 20 degrees below zero up to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Dell claims that this model has passed the  MIL-STD-810G testing which basically tests the resilience of a device to survive a fall of a certain degree, which here is from up to six feet.</p>
<p>Dell&#8217;s spec sheets claim the following for the 7424:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MIL-STD-810G testing:</strong> Transit drop 72&#8243;/.91m, 60&#8243;/1.52m, 48&#8243;/1.22m; single unit; 78 drops, operating drop (36&#8243;/0.91m), blowing rain, blowing dust, blowing sand, vibration, functional shock, humidity, salt fog (with rubberized keyboard), altitude, explosive atmosphere, solar radiation, thermal extremes, thermal shock, freeze/thaw, tactical standby to operational.</p>
<p><strong>Operating thermal range:</strong> -20°F to 145°F (-29°C to 63°C)</p>
<p><strong>Non-operating range:</strong> -60°F to 160°F (-51°C to 71°C)</p>
<p><strong>IEC 60529 ingress protection:</strong> IP-65 (dust-tight, protected against pressurized water)</p></blockquote>
<p>To top things off, there is a Windows Hello IR camera, and a fingerprint reader addition. Of course, if the device is intended for military and industrial usage, it has to accompany various security features to keep sensitive data safe and encrypted.</p>
<p>The assortment of ports come from USB Type-C to an RS-232 serial, a RJ45, HDMI, VGA/Display (optional), Fischer USB, and pogo-pin connectors for docking.</p>
<p>The Latitude 7424 Rugged Extreme being a little too much on the pricey end, will be available <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-7424-rugged-extreme/spd/latitude-14-7424-laptop/xctol742414us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">starting from $3,500</a>. But of course, for a premium+hardcore device, users are expected to compensate the same as well.</p>
<h3>New Latitude 5420 and 5424 Rugged</h3>
<p>Minutely &#8216;thinner&#8217; additions &#8211; the 5424 Rugged and an even slimmer, the 5420, are essentially identical to the 7424 Rugged Extreme. That is only in terms of hardware, but as for durability, they have a somewhat lower tolerance for drops (up to three feet) and weigh around 5 to 7 pounds.</p>
<div id="attachment_4440" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4440" class="wp-image-4440 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-Latitude-5420-Rugged.jpg" alt="Dell Latitude 5420 Rugged" width="661" height="438" /><p id="caption-attachment-4440" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Dell Latitude 5420 Rugged in Rain | Image &#8211; Dell</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The 5424 and 5420 can too standby difficult environments but to a lesser extent. It might not last in heavy rain and dust storm but will surely make through, vibration, minor quakes, shock, heavy humidity, dripping water, and high altitudes.</p>
<p>For 5424 and 5420, Dell claims:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>MIL-STD-810G testing:</strong> Transit drop 36&#8243;/.91m; single unit; 26 drops, operating drop (36”/0.91m), blowing dust, vibration, functional shock, humidity, altitude, thermal extremes</p>
<p><strong>Operating thermal range:</strong> -20°F to 140°F (-29°C to 60°C)</p>
<p><strong>Non-operating range:</strong> -60°F to 160°F (-51°C to 71°C)</p>
<p><strong>IEC 60529 ingress protection:</strong> IP-52 (dust-protected, protected against dripping water when tilted up to 15°)</p></blockquote>
<p>All other hardware specifications are more or less the same in all three variants of the Latitude.</p>
<p>The Latitude 5424 and 5420 Rugged will be available at the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-5424-rugged/spd/latitude-14-5424-laptop/xctol542414us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">starting price of $1,500</a> and <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/new-latitude-5420-rugged/spd/latitude-14-5420-laptop/xctol542014us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$1,400 from Dell</a>, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-exterior-design.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 2018 - exterior design" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Our Most Recommended Portable Laptops</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>

<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4252" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-image-4252 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-9370-2018-battery-test.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 2018 - battery test" width="733" height="550"><p id="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-caption-text">Image by &#8211; forester401 on flickr</p></div>
<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever you think about the perfect gaming machine, whether you are a user or not &#8211; the name Alienware comes to mind. Known for their robustness &#8211; the Dell&#8217;s Alienware series is unmatchable in terms of their gaming performance. Despite having a reputation as the &#8216;jocks&#8217; of laptops, Alienware is stepping out of its horizon. With its latest release, Alienware m15, the company has tried to make a sleeker and more compact laptop. This means that apart from being complete gaming monsters, the Alienwares will not be left out of the sleek and slim series.</p>
<p>The body of the new Alienware m15 is made from a magnesium and copper alloy. Dell claims the Alienware m15 to be the trimmest gaming machine with its sides measuring at 0.8 inch and a total weight of 4.8 pounds.</p>
<h3>The Machine</h3>
<h5>Slim design</h5>
<p>The entire structure of the laptop has been cut and clipped. The bezel is slimmer than its predecessors, the keypad has been changed to a chiclet design and keys are finer around the edges. But all this chopping off has come with a small price. Turns out that the bulkiness of the machine helped to fend off overheating. Now with a sleeker version, the chances of exhausting heat look slimmer as well.</p>
<h5>Processing</h5>
<p>Back to the good parts, the machine&#8217;s insides hold an 8th Generation Intel Core <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-core-i5-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i5-8300H</a> and <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-core-i7-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i7-8750H</a> processor. For the GPU, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 1060 OC or 1070 Max-Q are hosted in different models. It&#8217;s commendable how Dell has maintained the performance standard of Alienwares and then some. According to sources, Alienware m15 can deliver nearly 50% better gaming performance than the Alienware 13. So, the shedding of weight costs no performance loss in comparison with the older Alienware 15 laptop.</p>
<h5>Keyboard</h5>
<p>For some reason, I have always been fond of the backlit keyboard of Alienwares. They looked like the only vibrant aspect of an otherwise tank-like posture of the laptop. The device sports a new mSeries keyboard inside with dedicated numeric pad and has a 1.4mm traveling keys with individually programmable RGB backlighting.</p>
<p>The lighting option is spread across four other zones which include Alienware logo on the lid, sides and the power button. It gives complete support for the Alienware Command Center.</p>
<div id="attachment_4239" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4239" class="wp-image-4239 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/alienware-m15-launched.jpg" alt="Alienware m15 launch event image" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-4239" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Alienware m15</strong> | Image &#8211; cnet</p></div>
<h5>Ports</h5>
<p>Other than that, the Alienware hosts a generous selection of ports, spread around its sides and the back. On the machine, you&#8217;ll find an HDMI 2.0 output, a USB-C connector with Thunderbolt 3, a mini DisplayPort 1.3 jack and the power port. Giving special attention to the Alienware external GPU (eGPU), there is a dedicated port just for its connection.</p>
<h5>Standby power</h5>
<p>Another impressive factor is the battery on the new Alienware m15. The juice can last up to 17 hours on the optional 90 watt hour battery in idle state. Even 13 hours with the standard 60 watt hour battery is quite commendable. The final verdict on the battery life remains to be tested though until we review this laptop.</p>
<h3>Now about the Bucks</h3>
<p>The m15 will be available in two different color options, Nebula Red and Epic silver.</p>
<p>The Alienware m15 comes with a starting price of $1,299 which is for the most basic, yet adequately powerful version. You can however opt for impressive upgrade options in terms of battery capacity, memory, and storage.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dell is globally renowned for providing laptops in various segments and it has been doing quite well to attract a huge audience with their offerings. This time, the brand has brought a mid-range 2-in-1 laptop, which comes with a cut-throat pricing for a mainstream convertible laptop.</p>
<p>Our current contender, the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, is an intruding product from the Dell’s Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 notebooks. The entire range of laptops from Dell is now coming with the latest 7th Generation Intel core processors for better performance. Since this laptop is constantly being a global best-seller, we decided to put this laptop to test, and this is what we feel of this affordable 2-in-1 notebook.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Speaking about the design and built quality of the Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY, the notebook comes with <strong>grey matte finished chassis</strong>. The laptop resembles most of the other laptops in the segment and is recessed inside a plastic chassis. On the top, the laptop comes with a gunmetal grey slab with Dell’s logo recessed in the centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_2302" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-image-2302 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-13-5000-2-in-1-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378 13 5000 2 in 1 Laptop - Design" width="600" height="404" /><p id="caption-attachment-2302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Laptop (Gun Metal Color)</strong></p></div>
<p>It sports a 13.3-inch display and comes with a <strong>backlit enabled chuckle keyboard</strong>, which is very well designed for all forms of usage. The trackpad is also very well placed and is comfortable to use. On the either sides of the laptop, you have one USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a charging slot. Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with dimensions of 325 x 224 x 20.4mm, which makes it a slim offering in the segment. Also, the laptop <strong>weighs just 3.4 pounds</strong>, making it a perfect portable and easy to carry around laptop, which is <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students – Pro Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most suited for college students</a>, business men or anyone who wants powerful and lightweight laptop for their work.</p>
<div id="attachment_2303" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-image-2303 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-Series-2-in-1-Different-Modes.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 Series 2-in-1 Different Modes" width="700" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2303" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>1. Tent Mode | 2. Stand Mode | 3. Tablet Mode</strong></p></div>
<p>Now, getting deeper into the convertibility and ergonomics of this laptop, it comes with an innovative <strong>360-degree hinge</strong>, which adds on to the versatility and comfort of usage. The laptop allows you to switch easily between four different modes. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tent mode</span> is perfect for using recipes in real time, this mode is also perfect for video calling your friends and family while working on something. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stand mode</span> of this convertible notebook is meant for movies on the go. The typical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop mode</span> is meant for most of your routine work that you&#8217;d do from your laptops such as <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on word documents</a>, writing emails, and more.  Finally, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tablet mode</span> makes reading easy while you’re leant or reclined.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop sports a <strong>13.3-inch Full HD display</strong>, which comes with a new design emphasised on more screen and less bezel. This not only gives a larger display but also provides a wide-angle display. The display panel on the device is a TrueLife LED-backlit touch display, which provides a brilliant wide-angle view. The laptop’s screen comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, giving it a sharper image quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_2305" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-image-2305 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-13-5000-convertible-display.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron 13 5000 convertible laptop - display" width="800" height="553" /><p id="caption-attachment-2305" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>13.3 Inch Full HD Touchscreen Display with 1920 x 1080 Resolution</strong></p></div>
<p>The laptop’s display is not the brightest you get in the segment, and we felt that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was quite dull</span>. The laptop’s sunlight legibility isn&#8217;t the best, and the blacks on the display weren&#8217;t accurate as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre. All in all, the laptop’s display is surely a worth considering drawback of the notebook. However, its touchscreen functionality works absolutely fine in almost all the use cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as aforementioned offers a good set of specifications and hardware for the asking price.</p>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, speaking about the actual innards of this laptop, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with a handsome set of hardware and features. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, the processor can achieve a clock speed of 3.10GHz, which makes it very easy for the device to handle heavy games and apps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i5 Processors (New 2017 Kaby Lake Laptops)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive <strong>1TB of hard disk with 5400RPM</strong>, which is another attractive feature for the price segment it comes under. It also houses Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor to handle all the graphic related content.</p>
<p><em>Like most of the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small convertible laptops</a>, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop also <strong>doesn&#8217;t house a CD/DVD drive</strong> with it.</em></p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Dell Inspiron i5378 sports a 720p camera, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. Although the images captured using the laptop’s webcam are kind of grainy, the video calls made are serviceable. The colour reproduction is accurate and a camera does manage to capture a lot of details in the images.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the laptop’s <strong>webcam uses infrared technology to bolster facial recognition</strong>. It&#8217;s actually very hard to find facial recognition in laptops at this price range, which is again a very good aspect of the laptop.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Like all other Dell Inspiron 5000 series of laptops, the 2-in-1 i5378 also comes with a good set of ports to support additional peripheral devices and to make the most of a laptop. Speaking of the ports, the laptop houses <strong>one USB 2.0 port</strong> for your regular usage, <strong>two USB 3.0 ports</strong> for enhanced data transfers and added functionalities when you connect any peripherals.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY - Ports and Slots" width="519" height="334" />The laptop also houses a full sized <strong>HDMI port</strong> to connect to any display devices. As far as the audio connections are concerned, it comes with a 3.5mm combo audio jack. The Dell Inspiron also houses a <strong>Micro-SD card reader</strong> slot to connect with an SD card. We would have loved the USB Type-C port and we hope that Dell will include it, may be in their next generation 5000 series convertibles?</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY runs <strong>Windows 10 64-bit Home</strong> variant right out-of-the-box. Windows 10 is absolutely the most productive OS in the contemporary world and evidently, doesn&#8217;t need an introduction in the field of laptops. It is not just productive but is also the most common, easy-to-use, reliable, and an OS with the highest number of compatible apps for laptops.</p>
<p>Like all the latest Inspiron laptops, the current laptop also comes with a set of useful apps, readily installed with the laptop. These includes <em>Dell’s SupportAssist</em> app, which is a fairly useful app to provide the right tech support in case of troubleshooting. The <em>Dell Update</em> app makes sure the laptop runs on the latest OS and has all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the other apps which come preloaded with the laptop, there is some <a title="Software bloat - Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bloatware</a> includes such as DropBox, Royal Revolt 2, Facebook, Netflix, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Twitter, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, and Houzz. Some of them are useful but others can be easily uninstalled.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>laptop comes with a one-year warranty</strong></span>, like most of the other laptops. However, Dell’s after sales support is far better than that of most of the other brands.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to the latest <strong>Kaby Lake (7th Gen)</strong> Intel Core i5-7200U Processor clocked at up to 3.10 GHz, the new Dell Inspiron 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop runs utterly smooth in almost all the everyday essentials such as handling apps, using for multimedia purposes, gaming, and more. The processor is paired with a good <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, which makes the laptop able to handle multitasking with ease. During our review, we tested the laptop with multiple apps running simultaneously, to which the laptop responded really well. Although there was a very minute lag, it was hardly noticeable.</p>
<p>For multitasking, we tested the laptop by running benchmarking apps in the background, Google Chrome with up to 15 tabs opened simultaneously, music in the background, and with a constant connectivity to the internet. The laptop was hardly warmed even after 1 hour of such extensive usage session.</p>
<p>During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good <strong>62,482</strong> on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. On Geekbench 4, the laptop scored <strong>6800</strong> which depicts the overall system performance with a stress on graphics reproducibility. These numbers are pretty impressive for a <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops in $500 - $600 Price Range" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop priced just little above $500</a>.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Dell Inspiron i5378 comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics bolstered by the <strong>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 graphics coprocessor</strong>. Although the laptop does have a decent set of specifications, it is not meant for extensive and heavy gaming with high graphics and is, therefore, not a <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily gaming stationed laptop</a>.</p>
<p>Although the laptop is not meant to handle heavy games such as GTA V, Battlefield, or the DEUS EX in their highest graphics mode, most of the games like the Counterstrike, heroes of the Storm, and Shadowman were still pretty much playable when the graphics set to low/medium.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop can although handle games and graphic-intense apps to an extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s not for the people whose primary concern is gaming</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to read &#8211; <a title="Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 7 Best Cheap Gaming Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with <strong>two built-in Stereo speakers</strong>, which are powered by MaxxAudio technology, for better all round sound. The speakers do a great job in providing decent audio output and also doesn&#8217;t turtle at the volume set to maximum. We played high-quality FLAC files on this laptop and the output was just as loud and clear as expected.</p>

<p>As far as playing videos, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laptop can handle HD, Full HD, 2K, and 4K videos without an issue</span> and thanks to the wide-angle screen, watching videos and movies on this 2-in-1 convertible is fun and convincing.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Dell Inspiron 13 5378 2-in-1 is a powerful laptop with a decent set of specifications including a Full HD display. As for the battery life, the laptop stays juiced up by a 3-cell, 42 Whr battery pack. During our review, the laptop lasted for around <strong>6 hours of continuous usage</strong>. The battery backup is not the greatest considering other similar laptops in the segment delivering 8-10 hours of battery backup. The laptop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">takes about 3 hours to get charged</span> from 0 to 100.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1937" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Dell Inspiron i5378-2885GRY 13-Inch FHD Laptop" width="550" height="350" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-300x191.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Dell-Inspiron-i5378-2885GRY-13-Inch-FHD-Laptop-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />Dell Inspiron i5378 is definitely a power-packed convertible 2-in-1 laptop, which you can get at this price. The laptop does have few pros and cons, but after an extensive review, we personally feel that the laptop has more advantages and benefits than that of its drawbacks. The <strong>dull display can be overlooked</strong> with its convertible feature. Mediocre battery life can be overlooked by its powerful performance.</p>
<p>All in all, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptop</span> is definitely a must buy, if you&#8217;re looking for a laptop to flaunt with looks, portability, and performance.</p>
