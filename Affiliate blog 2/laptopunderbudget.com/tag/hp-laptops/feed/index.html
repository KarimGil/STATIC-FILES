										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, you must have learned about <a title="HP gives a boost to their Elite 800 notebooks with SureSense and advanced privacy features" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/hp-gives-boost-elite-800-notebooks-suresense-advanced-privacy-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP&#8217;s Elitebook upgrades</a> but that&#8217;s not all HP is up to. Their already top of the line business machines the ZBooks are now powered with even improved hardware and endowed with high build quality.</p>
<p>The new upgrades involve the 14U and 15U G6 workstations, named for their 14 and 15.6-inch screen sizes. But that is the only major difference between them. The insides are assembled with eighth-generation Intel CPU with tons of variants to choose from. Starting at the Core i5-8265U, and going all the way up to the i7-8665U. Storage options go from 128GB to 2TB of SSD while you can configure the machines with 32GB of DDR4 memory, an AMD WX 3200 graphics if you are in pursuit of 3D rendering.</p>
<p>Now all this might not be packed in the exterior that you imagine but trust me, do not let the skinny frame fool you. Their contemporary aluminium chassis can withstand much more than traditional &#8216;durable&#8217; machines. HP has managed to make these brawny enough to pass 19 MIL-STD tests so the professional users do not have to worry about travelling with them in unpleasant weather conditions. However, their gauntness did take a toll on the port selection. You will only find a USB 3.0 port, an RJ-45 Ethernet input, a Thunderbolt port, an HDMI and headphone jack in the selection. HP also sacrificed the U-Series Intel chips for H-series which might not be able to live up to the typical workstation laptop performance. But let&#8217;s hope that the Core-i7 processors and the extensive storage make up for the shortfall.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>An exciting upgrade is the 4K screen option, offering remarkable 400 nits of brightness. You can also take things up a notch with 1080p screen alternatives and a variety of other options including protective glass anti-glare coatings, and touch support. The 14U and 15U are packed with 50-watt-hour and 56-watt-hour batteries respectively, delivering up to 14 hours per charge. This might not seem as impressive to business professionals for a mobile workstation but the fast charging feature offers a ray of hope. And yes, HP has made sure to add Sure View in Zbooks as well to block out unwanted eyes and prying co-workers.</p>
<p>Weighing just a litter under 4 pounds, the Zbooks aren&#8217;t really breaking barriers in the &#8216;lightweight&#8217; area but specs like Wi-Fi 6, LTE advanced and Bluetooth kind of takes the attention away from its minor shortcomings.</p>
<p>HP is yet to disclose the price of these workstation ultrabooks but we&#8217;ll sure know it before May 27 which is when the devices will be available for purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has worked through and through on their Elite 800 series notebooks and have come up with not just refined functionalities but have equipped the new editions with over the charts hardware as well.</p>
<h3>Improved malware protection</h3>
<p>More specifically, HP&#8217;s clamshell designed EliteBook 830 G6, EliteBook 840 G6, EliteBook 850 G6 and the convertible EliteBook x360 830 G6 are getting an upgrade. Starting with the most notable one, the Sure Sense technology. If you are not familiar with the concept, Sure Sense is an advanced malware detection program that works alongside Windows Defender.</p>
<p>HP recognized Sure Sense as a cutting edge technology instead of just another anti-virus due to its light footprint on your machine. HP claims that running Sure Sense won&#8217;t choke your system&#8217;s arteries and would work seamlessly even without an active internet connection. These are alongside Sure Sense&#8217;s obvious characteristics: lightweight performance capabilities, ability to flag known and unknown ransomware and HP Sure Click. Sure Click will be the system&#8217;s defence mechanism which sandboxes browser tabs and allows you to browse untrusted websites and open suspicious attachments in a protected virtual environment.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new with the hardware</h3>
<p>HP has equipped the EliteBook 830 G6, HP EliteBook 840 G6, and HP EliteBook 850 G6, and the HP EliteBook x360 830 G6 with a privacy shutter to save you from prying eyes, a whopping 18 hour battery backup, and a 1,000-nit screen.</p>
<p>The Elitebook 830 G6 and EliteBook x360 830 G6 will come with a Core i3-8145U additional option while Core i5-8265U and Core i7-8565 Whiskey Lake processor options are common for all four editions in this lineup. The options of memory go up to 32GB for RAM and up to 512GB for SSD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_5513" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5513" class="size-full wp-image-5513" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HP-Elitebook-800-Series-Notebooks.jpg" alt="HP Elitebook 800 Series Notebooks" width="1217" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5513" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit &#8211; HP</em></p></div>
<p>The editions vary in screen sizes as well. The EliteBook 830 G6 and x360 830 G6 will come with 13.3-inch displays. Whereas the 840 G6 rocks a 14-inch panel and the 850 G6 is a 15-inch laptop. You can also get additional custom specs with the 14-inch EliteBook 840 G6 and 15.6-inch EliteBook 850 G6 and add a Radeon RX 550 GPU. So there are a lot of options to go about here.</p>
<p>The EliteBook G6 however, has been specially blessed by HP with an embedded touch sensor and an in-built webcam cover. However, the EliteBook x360 830 will star an anti-glare, glossy or Sure View touchscreen display.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s left</h4>
<p>Elitebooks in 2019, will have full support for 4G LTE data connectivity, the latest Wi-Fi 6 standards, Bluetooth 5 and HP&#8217;s Extended Range Wireless LAN technology. One thing we know here for certain is that the Elitebooks will leave no room for a patchy, disruptive browsing experience and will ensure reliable connectivity to other peripherals as well.</p>
<p>While little is known about the pricing of Elitebooks, but we can most certainly be sure that they won&#8217;t be cheap. The Elitebooks will start hitting the shelves in May with only x360 830 G6 to be available in June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who is familiar with HP&#8217;s laptop categories would know that their Envy series is the most reasonable and accessible one. Considering that it sits right between their premium Spectre laptops and their lower end Pavilion series. But those were facts till 2018.</p>
<p>HP has recently worked on their Envy series to meet the standards of Spectre laptops and has introduced features like upgraded processors, a webcam privacy switch (that cuts off the power to the camera), fingerprint reader, wake-on voice, Sure View and built-in support for Alexa for some as well. There are noticeable hardware upgrades as will like slimmer bezels and reduced weightage.</p>
<p>But that is not even the best part. Even with these premium specs, HP has still managed to keep their price range below $1000 which is considered to be the minimum price benchmark of premium laptops.</p>
<h2>HP Envy 13 and HP Envy 17 &#8211; the non-convertibles</h2>
<p>Featuring Intel Core 8th-generation<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/07/intel-announces-six-new-ninth-generation-core-processors/"> </a>processors the HP Envy 13 and Envy 17 with no reversible hinges are traditional laptops receiving the 2019 upgrades.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5414" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-13.jpg" alt="New HP Envy 13 " width="418" height="355" />The HP Envy 13 has been revamped to shed a few pounds and inches too. Remodeled to be 0.2 mm thinner and 0.03 pounds lighter than its 2018 counterpart. HP has also blessed this one with a Left hinge that extends the bottom of its lid to bump up the keyboard for easy typing. What I like best about this remodeling is that we won&#8217;t be suffering from the loss of USB Type A ports due to the slim body. HP has come up with a &#8216;drop jaw&#8217; design that let you connect USB supported devices by simply pulling down a flap. The complete set of ports include USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, two  USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a headset jack, and a microSD card reader.</p>
<p>For the Envy 13, HP claims that its 53 Wh battery is capable of providing 16 hours of backup which sounds a little on the &#8216;too good to be true&#8217; area. The processors can go up to Intel Core i7-8565U, an 8GB DDR4-2400 memory (onboarded and not upgradeable) and a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5415" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-17.jpg" alt="HP Envy 17 2019" width="442" height="376" />The Envy 17 might interest some gamers due to its NVIDIA&#8217;s GeForce MX250 graphics on board. As there is more room on this one, HP has loaded the Envy 17 with 12GB of RAM, 32GB of Intel Optane memory, and a 512GB PCie NVMe solid state drive. Also blessed with thinner bezels, the Envy 17 is estimated to be 45% slimmer than its 2018 version.</span></p>
<p>The display on both these models comes with a 1980 x 1080 touch screen alongside a backlit keyboard and stereo B&amp;O speakers. Color variety of these includes Pale Gold, Natural Silver, and Nightfall Black shades. Both are expected to be available by April starting from $899.</p>
<h2 style="font-style: normal; line-height: 41.6px;">HP Envy x360 13 and Envy x360 15 &#8211; the convertibles</h2>
<p>The Envy x360 15 and Envy x360 15 are the classic convertibles which can be molded into a tablet or into tent mode by the rotating hinge. While the HP Envy 13 and Envy 17 might pique the interest of students and gamers, these two are most likely suitable for arts and graphics enthusiasts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5416" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-x360-13.jpg" alt="HP Envy x360 13 2019" width="394" height="259" />The Envy x360 13 will be using an AMD&#8217;s 2nd-gen Ryzen processor, can deliver up to 14.5 hours of battery backup, includes up to 1TB of SSD storage and up to 16GB of RAM. The ports selection will boast two USB 3.1 Type-A ports along with a USB-C input and a headphone jack. This one is just 0.6 inches thick and weighs only 2.9 pounds. That is the most we know about the Envy x360 13.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5417" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-x360-15.jpg" alt="HP Envy x360 - 2019" width="438" height="232" />Now the x360 15 is a whole other story. It comes with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors and AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 5 or 7 processors so there are plenty of options to go about here. There is 8GB of RAM and the most basic configuration has a 256GB SSD while the higher-end model is boosted with 512GB of storage. The screen res remains the same throughout each config that is a 1980 x 1080 15.6 inch touchscreen with tiny bezels. There are a lot of other amenities too like quad speakers tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen, and a backlit keyboard with a num keypad. Battery backup is claimed to be 13 hours approx depending upon the usage. The notebook measures 14.1 inches to 9.7 inches and 0.7 inches &#8211; weighing just about 4.5 pounds. The ports selection includes a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, an HDMI port, and a headset jack and an SD card reader.</p>
<p>The price for the Envy x360 13 starts from $700 and for the x360 15 HP will sell AMD Ryzen-powered models for $800 and up. Choices of processors include Ryzen 5 2500U or Ryzen 7 3700U processors with Radeon Vega integrated graphics. For Intel models, it will cost you $800. Both models are expected to be released by April.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has announced its refreshed lineup of convertible laptops series Pavilion x360. In an announcement made earlier today, Hewlett Packard has introduced three new laptops in three different screen sizes &#8211; 11.6-inches, 14-inches, and 15.6-inches. The OEM&#8217;s Pavilion x360 series consisting of 2-in-1 laptops are known for featuring a touch screen, seamless design, and powerful performance. With its refreshed lineup, HP has tried to entice users with budget constraints who are looking forward to purchase a laptop that doubles up as a tablet.</p>
<p>Here are the new Pavilion x360 convertible laptops along with their specifications.</p>
<h3>1. HP Pavilion x360  11 &#8211; A 11.6-inch fanless convertible laptop</h3>
<p>Out of the three newly announced convertible laptops, HP Pavilion x360 11 is the cheapest and only model to feature a fanless design. It is a sleek and lightweight 2-in-1 laptop having an 11.6-inches display weighing just 2.7 pounds. The laptop is powered by an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 quad-core Gemini Lake processor which is pretty decent for an entry-level laptop. It features 4GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage. HP Pavilion x360 11 is supported by a 37.69 Wh battery and is accompanied with a 45-watt power adapter. HP has said that the 11-inch notebook will offer up to 10:45 hours of battery life.</p>

<p>Additionally, for connectivity,  the laptop has  802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 (5Gb/s) port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports, a headset jack, and a microSD card reader. The HP Pavilion x360 11 starts at $400 and will be available from May onwards.</p>
<h3>2. HP Pavilion x360 14 &#8211; A 14-inch convertible laptop supporting 8th Gen i7 Processors</h3>
<p>Next in the refreshed x360 lineup is a 14-inch convertible PC which is aimed at power users. HP Pavilion x360 14 features an exciting design with a 3-sided micro edge display that makes bezels thinner. On the design front, HP boasts that it has provided a new hourglass edge to make it easier for users to open the laptop easily from all three sides. However, at 0.8-inches thick and weighing 4.3 pounds, it is not as stylish and portable as the 11-inch x360.</p>
<p>Unlike its 11-inch sibling, it is configurable and supports up to 8th generation Intel Core i7 processors. Carrying an HD display having 1366 X 768 resolution or optional 1080p display, the base variant of x360 14 comes with an Intel Core i3-8145U processor, Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM and internal storage of 128GB. The laptop supports up to 1TB HDD and up to 512GB PCIe SSD.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5397" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1422-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 14 - 2019" width="696" height="536" /></p>
<p>For more power, it also supports up to Intel Core i7- 8565U processor, 16GB of RAM and NVIDIA Geforce MX130 or newest MX250 graphics card. HP has provided 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a USB Type-C Generation 1 port, an HDMI 1.4 port, a 3.5mm audio jack, an SD card reader and two USB 3.1 Type &#8211; A Gen 1 ports. A fingerprint reader is also available for users as an extra option for authentication. The company has said that x360 14 will provide the battery life of up to 11 hours.</p>
<p>HP Pavilion x360 14 starts at $500 and will be available in the market from April onwards.</p>
<h3>3. HP Pavilion x360 15 &#8211; a 15-inch convertible laptop supporting AMD Radeon 535 graphics card</h3>
<p>For large screen seekers, HP has announced its x360 15 that sports a 15.6-inch display with 1366&#215;768  or 1920&#215;1080 resolution. It shares its design with its 14-inch sibling and features the same hourglass edge and 3-sided micro-edge display for design with thinner bezels. Measuring 14.1″ x 8.4″ x 0.8″, this model weighs 4.3 pounds which is, again, not lightweight exactly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5398" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1522-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 15 - 2019" width="723" height="495" /></p>
<p>On the performance front, HP Pavilion x360 15 also supports 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and a couple of storage options. This model also supports AMD Radeon 535 graphics card and can be used for purposes like video editing, animation and much more. You can configure x360 15 with up to 2TB HDD and up to 512GB PCIe SSD. HP has provided a multi-format card reader, a USB Type-C port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports and a 3.5mm port for audio accessories.</p>
<p>The Pavilion x360 15 has its downside in the form of the same 41 Wh battery which means that we cannot expect a long battery life from it.</p>
<p>HP Pavilion x360 15 starts at $800 and will be available from  April this year.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">All the three new Pavilion convertibles will be available in different color options &#8211; Cloud Blue, Pale Gold, and HP&#8217;s standard Natural Silver color. Also, HP convertibles are fitted with dual speakers and HP audio boost with Audio by B&amp;O.</span></p>
<p>In addition to convertible laptops, HP has also announced two new monitors including one with 27f 4K Display and another featuring 34f Curved Display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is making the move to the red team, releasing two new AMD-Powered HP ProBook models, the 445 G6 and the 455 G6.</p>
<p>Aimed towards small businesses and start-ups alike, both models will feature exclusively Ryzen and Ryzen Pro APUs. But, because the HP ProBook is a business-grade laptop, you&#8217;ll see multiple features that you normally wouldn&#8217;t see in conventional laptops. This includes improved security features, better durability, longer battery life, and an ultra-thin design that&#8217;s all complemented by relatively low asking price.</p>
<h2>The New and Improved AMD-Powered HP ProBook</h2>
<p>For all the flack that AMD has received over the past few years, they have slowly been delivering in the laptop side of things. HP&#8217;s latest decision to arm the HP ProBook should help serve as validation for the once-struggling Intel rival.</p>
<p>Built for the growing business owner, the HP ProBook 445 and 455 will sport a full-aluminum chassis as well as the latest in AMD technology. Both can come with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 2700 APU, which also comes with a Radeon RX Vega 10 GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and plenty of storage with up to a 512GB SSD.</p>
<p>Being that these were made to stand a beating, the newest HP ProBooks passed MIL-STD 810G standard testing and comes equipped with a spill-resistant keyboard.</p>
<p>Finally, at just 0.71-0.75 inches thin, the neat and compact design, paired with its respectable specifications (especially for the price) and batteries rated to last for nearly 12 hours on a single charge, should easily make this business laptop a favorite. Albeit, not for anything remotely close to graphic design. With a screen that emits only over 220 nits of brightness and just over 67 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the display is subpar, to say the least. It also certainly doesn&#8217;t help that the bezels on the screen are a bit thicker.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>HP confirmed that they plan to launch the the sixth-generation of the HP ProBook sometime later in January at a starting price point of $549.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is planning to rule over the education market with their latest Intel-based Chromebook announcements. The HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 and HP Chromebook 11 G7 EE.</p>
<p>HP plans on releasing these notebooks around April which is just the right time for tech vendors to release contrabands for school year buying cycle. Chromebooks being one of the most popular purchases for students and teachers could definitely use an upgrade like this in 2019.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The best laptops for college students of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For instance, the HP Chromebook x360 11 G2 Education Edition is loaded with the latest Intel Celeron processors N4100 or N4000 and Intel UHD Graphics 600. Alongside is its claimed 11.5-hour battery life which if true, is hard to find standup average in budget notebooks. The device is also convertible, and the 360-degree hinge can hold up support in tablet, tent, stand and laptop modes. There is also an optional HP Wacom EMR pen, dual cameras, and support for type, touch, write, capture, and draw gestures as well.</p>
<p>The device also dons a good port selection and contains USB-C ports on each side, a USB 3 Type-A port, a microSD card reader, a Headset jack, 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 5.0. For the storage, HP has equipped this Chromebook with 64 GB eMMC storage and comes with 8GB of RAM for efficient multitasking. Additionally, it comes with a 2-year subscription to 100GB Google Drive which is a nice little bow to seal the package with.</p>
<p>With the same convertibility, port selection and the 11.6-inch screen size as its sibling x360 11 G2, the Chromebook 11 G7 EE is a more traditional take in this lineup. What the 11 G7 EE doesn&#8217;t have is its sibling&#8217;s 5MP world facing camera while both hold a 720p front-facing webcam. However, it does weight lighter &#8211; reaching about 2.9 pounds, as opposed to the 3.2 pounds of the x360 11 G2.</p>
<p>Another feature these both notebooks share is the configuration of processors and RAM, whereas the storage options in the G7 are available from 16GB to 64GB of eMMC 5.0 storage.</p>
<p>But the most impressive upgrade made by HP is shared by both Chromebooks that is the military grade robustness. Not only is it an extremely hard feature to find in budget Chromebooks like these, but it&#8217;s an addition that no one expected to get. The Chromebooks sport a minor-spill-resistant keyboard, shock-absorbing body, and Corning Gorilla Glass protection. It can also withstand a 76-centimeter drop on concrete. We think that HP paid attention to the rough routine that students usually put their laptops through and devised a solution that holds not only powerful internals but also keeps good and strong shape on the outside as well.</p>
<p>HP is yet to reveal the prices of these notebooks which will tell us a lot more about these upgrades, but until then, we can&#8217;t help but hope for it all to be good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest HP Omen 15 means serious business. Unveiled first at CES 2019, HP&#8217;s latest Omen 15 gaming laptop comes equipped with a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display with a <em><strong>240Hz refresh rate and a 4ms latency</strong></em>. This makes it the first-ever gaming laptop released in the world to have such a display. But, of course, HP also made sure that, under the hood, the laptop itself won&#8217;t lag behind its phenomenal screen.</p>
<h3>Hardware Specifications</h3>
<p>The HP Omen 15 will feature an 8th-Gen Intel Core i7-8750H processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and an RTX 2070 Max-Q mobile GPU from NVIDIA. It will also come shipped with modest storage space; the Omen 15 will use a 120GB M.2 SSD as its primary drive and a 1TB 7,200-rpm hard for some extra storage space. Finally, to make the Omen 15 easier to upgrade, HP decided to include a single-access panel at the bottom to make it easier to swap out the hard drive, SSD, and RAM, down the line.</p>
<h3>Design and Weight</h3>
<p>HP decided not to mess much with the design when it comes to the Omen 15.</p>
<p>Sporting the same red-and-black look that consumers have come to associate with their gaming laptops, the Omen 15 should fit quite right in with its predecessors. Even if the exterior is made entirely from plastic, it doesn&#8217;t stop the Omen 15 from exuding a more premium look, albeit one that still has a gamerish aesthetic.</p>
<p>Besides, not everything is plastic. Inside, the Omen 15 has an aluminum interior deck and a backlit keyboard with four zones of customization.</p>
<p>Clocking in at just 5.3 pounds and 14.2 x 10.4 x 1-inch overall, the HP Omen 15 is slightly lighter yet thicker compared to its contemporaries. For comparison, the ASUS ROG GU501 weighs 5.4 pounds but is just 0.7 inches thick. Meanwhile, the Dell G715 weighs 6.3 pounds and is just slightly thinner at 0.9 inches.</p>
<h3>A Display Built Solely for Gaming</h3>
<p>Of course, the most hyped upgrade to the latest HP Omen 15 isn&#8217;t the hardware nor the interior and exterior design. Rather, it&#8217;s the gaming laptop&#8217;s display.</p>
<p>To better cater to the hardcore gamers of today, HP equipped the Omen 15 with a 15.6-inch IPS display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 4ms latency — a massive improvement over the 144Hz display of the previous iteration. In doing so, HP made the Omen 15 the first gaming laptop of its kind on the market.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The new HP Omen 15 will start shipping out to retail stores in February starting at a $1,369 price point. However, these models will come with a different display and a still-unannounced &#8220;NVIDIA Graphics&#8221; mobile GPU. Those who are keen on having the 240Hz version will have to wait until July.</p>
<p>We currently don&#8217;t have pricing for the 240Hz version of the new Omen 15 as of yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when we thought HP couldn&#8217;t have made their ZBook line of mobile workstations more powerful, they go on and throw in the 8th generation Intel Core i9 processors in the mix.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s new in the mix?</h3>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long ago when HP bumped up their Zbook lineup. The laptops have now gotten a major boost and will now come built in with the Core i9 hexa core processor, Nvidia Quadro P2000 graphics and of course an increased RAM.</p>
<p>Four of its ZBook PCs: the ZBook Studio and the ZBook Studio x360, along with the ZBook 15 and 17 have received the upgrade. But they are still available with Core i5, Core i7 and Xeon options along with Intel&#8217;s latest innovation processors.</p>
<div id="attachment_4339" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4339" class="wp-image-4339 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HP-ZBook-Studio-x360.jpg" alt="HP ZBook Studio x360" width="700" height="467" /><p id="caption-attachment-4339" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; HP</p></div>
<p>Interestingly enough, HP doesn&#8217;t plan to stop here. The upgraded ZBook models also feature RAID 1 storage. This means that you can now have two solid state drives with the same data mirrored on both. This is a stellar feature for maintaining backups as you can always count on the other one in case the first drive fails.</p>
<p>Moreover, HP has rewarded both ZBook Studio and the ZBook Studio x360 with support for up to a 4K display and up to 32GB of RAM. The bendable x360 convertible model will also be equipped with an anti-glare touchscreen. This addition has made the display even brighter while also cutting down on glare.</p>
<p>HP claims for the improved display to be</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;20 percent brighter than the Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch Retina display and 50 percent brighter than the Dell XPS UltraSharp 4K display.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Looks like HP wants to make these two devices outshine in terms of graphics performance and display and market the notebooks&#8217; to better handle heavy workloads such as 3D rendering&#8217;.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <strong>ZBook 15</strong> and <strong>ZBook 17</strong> laptops are getting their RAM upped with up to 128GB now.</p>
<p>According to Xavier Garcia, VP and general manager of Z by HP &#8211; they listened to the needs of creative pros who need to</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;increase their productivity and create whenever and wherever inspiration strikes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>All four refreshed HP ZBook notebooks are <a href="http://tidd.ly/3fd4d188" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available now</a> on  HP&#8217;s website.  The ZBook 15, 17, and Studio are available starting at $1,349 (the 128GB RAM option available starting from December), while the ZBook Studio x360 causing a slightly more damage with the starting price of $1,499.</p>
<h3>The Z Club Subscription</h3>
<p>For creative professionals, HP has decided to introduce a  hardware subscription program along with a fresh plugin for Adobe Illustrator CC.</p>
<p>The Z Club, will act as what HP calls it &#8220;an exclusive program for elite creators to upgrade their studios.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="no-amazon"><p>A group of 100 creative professionals will be selected as initial members and will be outfitted with custom-made photographer, video editor, graphic designer or artist bundles.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seems like 2018 is going to leave us with a wave of premium laptop ranges. The stylish<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/"> Surface Pro 6</a> and the leather-wrapped <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/">Spectre Folio </a>and even the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/alienware-m15-first-thin-light-gaming-laptop/">Alienwares </a>were up to take the challenge this time in building the thinnest all-rounder PC ever.</p>
<p>Well, the year still hasn&#8217;t ended and there&#8217;s more to come. Turns out that HP has come up with a sleek design for their Chromebooks as well. Just yesterday, HP has released a trendy upgrade of their Chromebook x2; the Chromebook x360 14.</p>
<h3>Features and Specifications</h3>
<p>I have to say that the by looking at the specifications and architecture of the machine, it is directed towards more advanced users. While lacking the accessibility of a detachable keyboard like its sibling Chromebook x2, the Chromebook x360 14 packs the powerful 8th Gen Intel Core i3 or i5 processor. Not to mention the Advanced Electrodeposition (AED) body to give the chassis a matte ceramic finish along with durability and beauty. The &#8217;14&#8217; apparently denotes the 14-inch display which is a 16:9 1920×1080 IPS panel with pretty slim bezels. Complimenting the laptop&#8217;s overall appearance.</p>
<p>The keyboard &#8211; although not detachable, is fully backlit and the battery can last up to 13.5 hours of on a single charge. The device fashions two USB-C ports and a couple of USB-A ports too. The microSD slot and a headphone jack on the side, it also comes with an “HD Wide Vision” webcam.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Chromebook x360 14 hosts an <span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">8GB DDR4-2400 SDRAM with a </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">64GB eMMC storage. But it&#8217;s still a question whether these more than impressive specs be able to cover up the hole left by the absence of a pen in this device.</span></p>
<p>Another stance that HP is trying to make with the Chromebook x360 14 is that it&#8217;s a luxury device. Comparatively to the Chromebook x360 11 that was aimed more towards students.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4264" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HP-x360-14-Chromebook.jpg" alt="HP x360 14 Chromebook" width="600" height="419" /></p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>The Chromebook x360 15 is up for pre-orders now on HP&#8217;s <a href="http://tidd.ly/b3b1cd15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> and will be available in stores from October 21.</p>
<p>The device will cost you a total damage of $600. Seems like a fair price for a device that sits amongst the Elite notebooks in terms of specs, looks, and durability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP refers the latest unveiling of HP Spectre Folio as embracing the art of &#8220;manu<i>craft</i>uring&#8221;. The idea behind HP&#8217;s latest grandeur was to make <em>using laptops</em> more &#8216;comfortable&#8217;. They have emphasized towards its correspondence to a PC. Whether it be the look and feel, the <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portability</a> or the specs. Although it sounds quite customary, like every other hybrid convertible in the market, but there is a catch. It is encased inside a full grain leather surface.</p>
<p>According to HP, the wide acceptance and success of 2-in-1 convertible notebooks persuaded them to craft this design. Such laptops are usually targeted to fit in specific user domains. The HP Spectre thrives on the idea and can be adjusted into 3 different positions.</p>
<h3>Feel It!</h3>
<p>The motivation to experiment with the frame of the device was driven from the fact that it needs to feel more <em>humane</em>. Considering that your PC is your go-to buddy for your entire day whether you are a student or a working parent. Resting a cold plastic or metallic body on your lap is too outdated, monotonous and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Apart from the “whiff of ozone”, the traditional hard surface designs don’t really have a smell. Smell is more closely associated with the memory than any other sense. HP wanted to get around the fact and make the device feel more personal. Said Stacy Wolff, HP&#8217;s Global Head of Design.</p>
<p>She also mentions that the idea for a leather casing was also inspired by timeless everyday devices like camera and sewing machines. It was intended not just to provide a leather cover where you slid a metal device in, but to make it a part of the device entirely. The leather casing is directly latched to the laptop. There is no metallic body or surface underneath the supple leather casing and no metallic hinge either.</p>
<p>The versatility of the device is also tailored to market to unisex consumers. Giving off a classy and professional feel, the device can go with a bomber jacket as much as with a handbag.</p>
<p>HP has not used the idea of a leather exterior just as a marketing gimmick but has fully embraced it as an integral part of their gadget which is kind of a go big or go home standpoint.</p>
<h3>Carry It!</h3>
<p>With the concept of a leather casing earning HP major points, it is all moot if the gadget lacks the comfort for usage.</p>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio is bendable into 4 different positions. The embedded forty magnets are sturdy enough to fully support the device in any flexible position.</p>
<p>The on ‘top of the lap as a notebook’ position, tilted up for a cinematic aura, the plain flat surface tablet position and of course,  closed as a stylish leather folder.</p>
<p>HP asserts that by only slight one handed movements, the device can be transformed into different positions almost effortlessly. Even on a tilted angle (up to about 135 degrees), the device maintains a sturdy stature during touching and tapping gestures. Moreover, there are no hinges, buttons or locks to fiddle with to set the positions.</p>

<p>The versatility in the positions is aimed to fit the needs to different consumers. Propped up for media playing, flat out for sketching and drawing and the classic lap-top style for typing.</p>
<h3>Accessorize It!</h3>
<p>To spruce things up a bit, you can always compliment the gadget with some classic accessories.</p>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio can be coupled with an <a href="http://tidd.ly/93075c92" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP Tilt pen</a> for <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/">seamless writing and smooth drawing</a>. For orders now, you will be able to avail the stylus with a 15% discount too!</p>
<p>Another add-on can be the <a href="http://tidd.ly/39105365" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP Spectre Rechargeable Mouse</a>. A sleek silver, smooth finish prop that can be synced with up to 4 devices with easy switching. To add another plus besides its sleek finish, the gimmick can last up to 11 weeks on a single charge. Sounds like a perfect companion.</p>
<h3>Pre-Order It!</h3>
<p>The HP Spectre Folio will be available in 2 modern colors;  Cognac Brown and Bordeaux Burgundy.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the HP Spectre Folio have begun from October 1, 2018, at <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=MB1FB4lzy5Q&amp;mid=38606&amp;u1=laptopunderbudget&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-spectre-folio-2-in-1-13-3-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-cognac-brown%2F6301872.p%3FskuId%3D6301872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BestBuy.com</a> and <a href="http://tidd.ly/d7902d1b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HP.com</a>.</p>
<p>The device is expected to be available in Cognac Brown with an Intel® Core<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> i7 processor and 13.3-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080) IPS WLED backlit touchscreen, from October 29. The laptop will be available in a few different variants in terms of both body and specifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognac Brown with an with Intel’s 8th-gen dual-core Amber Lake Core i5-8200Y processor for a starting price of $1,299.99. It will come with a 1.3GHz base frequency and a 3.9GHz Turbo Boost mode.</li>
<li>Cognac Brown with an Intel’s 8th-gen dual-core Amber Lake Core i7 8500Y processor and LTE for a starting price of $1,499.99. It has a 1.5GHz base frequency and a 4.2GHz Turbo Boost mode.</li>
<li>Bordeaux Burgundy is expected to be available in late December.</li>
<li>The 4K panel option for the HP Spectre Folio is expected to come out late in December.</li>
<li>The stylish HP Spectre Folio Pouch and the HP Spectre Folio Sleeve are to be up for sale at HP.com in November for $49.99 and $69.99 respectively</li>
</ul>
<h3>But should you really buy It?</h3>
<p>Usually, devices targeted to <em>look pretty</em> or to be more specific &#8211; sleek and portable are not taken quite seriously by hardcore techies.</p>
<p>So far, it doesn&#8217;t look to be the same case with HP Spectre Folio. The 400 nits of brightness and a 13-inch, 1920×1080 unit seem pretty decent. Moreover, HP claims for the device to run for 18 to 21 hours on a single charge. This means to go about your entire day without a charger, and then some.</p>
<p>Having admired the interiors of the device, it seems like HP is pushing too hard for the device to be flagged as &#8216;premium&#8217;. HP is clearly experimenting with  Folio and trying to step out of their comfort zone. Sound quite similar to the attempts made by Microsoft to dominate the &#8216;premium laptop&#8217; market that Apple has ruled since forever.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would definitely try it.  Given the versatility of both the interior and exterior of the gadget, seems like a safe bet.</p>
