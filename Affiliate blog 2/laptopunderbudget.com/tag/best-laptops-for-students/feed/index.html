<h3 id="L1">1. Acer Aspire 1 <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Inexpensive Laptop for College</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2LNWs4t" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4874 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/acer-aspire-1-a114-32-c1ya.jpg" alt="Acer-Aspire-1 best cheap laptops for students" width="500" height="310"></a>Acer is a widely renowned international brand and is very well reputed in the field of laptops. The company understands the needs of every user covering every niche and accordingly release various laptops with good specifications at the asking price. And when it comes to a laptop for college, whatever may be the need, budget is a strict constraint. A students laptop has to be reliable and must satisfy the budget constraint.</p>
<p>To satisfy the above maxim, Acer introduced its Aspire 1, a 14-inch lightweight Notebook, which is not hard on the pocket but is packed with features, every student would love to have. Sporting a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14-inch Full HD display</span>, this laptop is powered by a dual-core Intel Celeron N4000 processor paired with 4GB of RAM.

It has a 10-inch pixelsense touch display which is smaller than the standard laptops, but it&#8217;s excellent in terms of color reproduction and is very sensitive to touches. It also supports Surface Pen which although costs extra, it makes Surface Go an excellent tablet to take notes in classroom.</p>
<p>The versatile form factor of the Microsoft Surface Go paired with a nice keyboard on its type cover makes working on-the-go and carrying it to different places way more easy than a standard laptop. Therefore, it is one of our most recommended budget laptops under $500 for students of 2019.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <strong>Dell XPS 13 2-in-1</strong> is also excellent option for college if you are looking to purchase a premium 2-in-1 laptop. Its price starts from $1000 which is slightly higher than the starting price of the standard XPS 13, but it offers the same nearly borderless 13.3-inch full HD InfinityEdge touchscreen display which can be rotated 360 degrees and premium aluminum chassis. It is powered by the Intel&#8217;s Y-series processor family, which is less powerful than the quad-core chips on standard XPS 13, but it will be enough for everyday college requirements. However, the webcam on the XPS 13 2-in-1 is nose peeking one like older XPS models, but you can rotate the display and use the webcam in tablet mode to avoid that. | <a title="Best Price on Dell" href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-2-in-1-laptop/spd/xps-13-9365-2-in-1-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Dell</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>

<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Chromebooks are probably the most renowned and well-known series of chromebooks across the globe. That said, since the inception of Chrome OS, very few brands started endorsing it and made this OS available in their machines. Acer is one among those aforementioned rare brands, who took the step further and brought a powerful lineup of Chromebooks to the audience. Moreover, the brand has also made sure that they will be available for all the price segments and have thus launched various models starting at as low as $160.</p>
<p>Although all the models, didn&#8217;t quite excelled in their segments, there are few Chromebooks, which established a firm market share and are currently one of the best sellers globally. Today, we are going to make you familiar with one of the most compact, efficient, and a complete value for money Chromebook, the Acer Chromebook 11 (CB3-131-C3SZ). We had quite a long and good time spending with this laptop, and here is our full review of it:<span id="more-1766"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Although the Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ is the cheapest chromebook available in the market, it does a pretty good job in offering a clean and polished exteriors. The laptop comes with a white case, which although looks neat and clean feels cheap. During our usage, we also felt that the laptop was hollow in certain areas from the chassis. One thing which is admirable in the laptop is its ruggedness. The chassis of the laptop doesn&#8217;t attract any smudges or scratches on it. On an overall note, the Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ is quite good for the asking price. Do note that you&#8217;re getting this laptop at the price of a toy. Uh, a costly toy maybe.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1828 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Laptop Design" width="750" height="532" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-300x213.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-610x433.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-600x426.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />The Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ comes with a standard chuckle keyboard. Key alignment and the keypad’s placement is largely similar to that of all other chromebooks. The keys are clear, visible, and are unfortunately not backlit enabled. The keyboard comes with good mechanics and all the keys offer good tactile feedback. Using TypingTest.com, I managed to score around 92 words per minute with six errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my MacBook Air. All that said, the laptop does offer a great keyboard for the asking price.</p>

<p>As far as the touchpad on this laptop is concerned, it is nice and spacious and works well with multitouch gestures as well. The laptop offers gestures including—touch to click, double touch to right-click, swipe with three fingers to switch between apps and much more based on the customisation. But we didn&#8217;t have a pleasant time using the mechanical click buttons on the trackpad. During our usage, these mechanical clicks often got stuck, which was annoying.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Coming to the display segment of the laptop, the Acer Chromebook CB3 sports an 11.6-inch HD display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. The display is of IPS LED type and comes with the Acer’s proprietary ComfyView Widescreen technology for a better viewing experience. Also, the screen is set to a fixed aspect ratio of 16:9. The matte display on the CB3 gains it an advantage when it comes to providing adequate brightness without hurting eyes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1830" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ Laptop - Display" width="750" height="474" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-300x190.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-610x386.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-600x379.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-Laptop-Keyboard-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />Not to mention, the laptop is priced under $200. The screen is combined with a laid back wide angles along with the decent amount of brightness and contrast. Matte finish on the display makes it suitable for almost all the indoor usage conditions.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Before we start giving out the specifications and hardware stuff of this Chromebook, we would like the viewers to first recollect the price of this device and proceed down. Under the hood, the laptop packs in a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2840 processor. The laptop is dual-core and with the help of Intel Burst technology, the laptop can achieve a clock speed of 2.58GHz. For multitasking, the Acer Chromebook 11 is equipped with a 2GB of DDR3L RAM, which is although very less when compared to other Windows-based laptops, is quite adequate for Chrome OS.</p>
<p>For graphics, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ ships with an integrated intel graphics processor, which takes care of rendering minor graphics. For storage, it offers a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-expandable</span> 16GB of solid state drive internal storage, which we feel is the major letdown for this budget-friendly Chromebook. However, if you&#8217;re always connected to the internet, then Google is offering free 100GB of online cloud storage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 offers an HD web camera at top of the screen. The camera is pretty fast in adjusting images on the frame. The shot to shot time is also comparatively very less than those in its competitors. The laptop is ideal for Skype or any other video calls due to its compact-sized weight.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1832" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Porst and Slots" width="1100" height="412" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg 1100w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-300x112.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-768x288.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-610x228.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-600x225.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots-50x19.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" />This pint-sized value-for-money laptop comes with a USB 3.0 port for faster file transfers. There is another USB 2.0 port, which comes quite handy if one requires connecting an additional peripheral. The laptop also comes with an HDMI port with HDCP port for wired media sharing.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ runs on the Google’s proprietary Chrome OS, which is a lightweight operating system for laptops. The OS is well-known for its resource utilisation and can deliver decent performance even under a feeble set of specifications. Accordingly, the CB3 offers a very decent performance for the hardware it packs in.</p>
<p>Although the software on the laptop offers a couple of interesting features such as file viewer, app grid, document editor, and more, there are few segments wherein, the software struggles. During our usage, we clearly felt that the software is not very well polished. However, we hope that it gets fixed with some regular updates. The Acer Chromebook CB3 is one among the <a title="Chrome OS Systems Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very few laptops listed</a> to eventually get access to the Google Play Store. In addition to that, it comes with all the popular Google’s lineup of apps with built-in: Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Hangouts.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>What performance would you expect from a laptop costing $160? That said, we aren&#8217;t demoting this laptop in any manner. It&#8217;s just that the hardware packed in the CB3 is very basic and evidently one cannot expect a class-leading performance from it. A dual-core entry-level mobile processor paired with a 2GB of RAM is although capable of handling basic tasks, it struggles under heavy usage. The best part is, the laptop is fan-less and therefore, doesn&#8217;t produce any sound during usage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ Exterior" width="740" height="655" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review.jpg 740w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-300x266.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-610x540.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-600x531.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-11-CB3-131-C3SZ-Review-50x44.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" />All the daily essentials such as browsing internet, handling text editors and readers runs fine without any considerable lag in them. In fact, we were quite amused from the performance and apps handling in the CB3. The laptop is pretty fast and quick when compared to the Windows counterpart. The Chrome OS is a great add-on for this entry-level laptop as there are not many background applications and services in Chrome OS as compared to a Windows OS.</p>

<p>On the connectivity front, the laptop supports a dual band 802.11ac WiFi featuring the company’s proprietary MIMO technology for faster network reception.</p>
<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, the laptop does quite good in handling graphics. Especially, considering the basic integrated graphics on the device. We ran few games such as tank rider and speed racer games, which although are light on graphics are quite entertaining. To our surprise, the laptop handled them all without any kind of lags or hiccups.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with two built-in stereo speakers which support high definition audio. We tried playing high definition FLAC files, for which the laptop did pretty well. The sound output is although not very loud, the audio produced is easily sufficient to fill a small sized room. We also tried playing some Full HD and 2K video content on the chromebook 11, for which the laptop did really well. Sadly, the laptop struggled a lot to handle 4K content.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 11 CB3-131-C3SZ stays pumped up using a 36 watt-hour battery, which is quite average considering the specifications. However, Acer did really well to squeeze a little more from the battery. Even during our usage, the laptop managed to deliver about 8 hours of continuous usage, which included watching videos running few basic benchmarks and browsing. During all the time, the WiFi was enabled. Therefore, we expect the laptop to deliver a little more of battery backup when the network reception is disabled. The laptop can be fully charged in less than 2 hours which is great.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 11" width="750" height="560" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop.jpg 750w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-300x224.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-610x455.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-600x448.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Chromebook-CB3-131-C3SZ-11-Inch-Laptop-50x37.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />On an overall note, the Acer Chromebook CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6-Inch Laptop is a complete value for money offering from Acer. The laptop not only managed to impress us, but also amazed us with some aspects such as battery life and performance. Assuming, you&#8217;re looking for a compact, value for money, and a browsing focussed laptop, then the Chromebook 11 must definitely be in your wish list.</p>
<p>At the asking price, there are hardly any competitors for the laptop. Not to mention the Chrome OS is a perfect supplement for the hardware the laptop packs in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS needs no introduction in the field of laptops. But we would like to give you an intro of the ZenBook series of laptops from ASUS. ZenBook series of laptops has taken the market by a storm and have earned a very powerful spot in the ultrabooks segment.</p>
<p>Following the same maxim, <strong>ASUS ZenBook UX305UA</strong> is the latest ultrabook in the ASUS’s lineup, which is promised to provide a punchy performance along with a really long-lasting battery backup. The laptop also resembles the legendary MacBook Air’s design aspects, with minute changes. The laptop is released with a lot of expectations, and we put the laptop to test, to find out how it excels in the real-time usage.<span id="more-1692"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>At our first glance at this beautifully crafted ZenBook, we noticed that it looks a lot like the Apple’s MacBook Air. It largely has the same overall, premium looking, stylish design and is largely built with metal chassis, complimented together with some plastics components.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1701 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design.png" alt="Asus ZenBook UX305UA Design" width="923" height="450" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design.png 923w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design-300x146.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design-768x374.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design-610x297.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design-600x293.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Design-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" />The laptop weighs slightly under 3 pounds making it one of the lightest laptops in its class. Moreover, the overall chassis of the laptop is made up of metal and is very well-polished to it all the premium touch you&#8217;d expect from a laptop this cost. The laptop is an absolute eye-catcher, and often people can mistake it to be the MacBook Air (except for the colour and primary logo at the centre). To the left of the laptop, you see a set of ports including an SD card slot and two USB ports. To the right, the laptop has a couple of LED indicators to display network connectivity, and charging. It also has a charging port, a USB port and a 3.5mm audio jack.</p>
<p>When you open the lid, you see a beautifully and neatly recessed keyboard which looks very identical to that of the previous ZenBooks. However, the keys this time are very neatly curved giving a great tactile feedback. Thankfully, that’s a perfect add-on for all the <a title="The Best Laptops for Writers - Our Most Recommended 7 Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">typing enthusiasts</a> or for the people involving a lot of typing jobs. After using the laptop for a couple of weeks, all we can say is, the keyboard is excellent for a 13-inch ultrabook, with a very neat and spacious layout and full-sized curved keys.</p>

<p>As soon as you press a key, you can feel that sweet cinch that the keys are touching to the dead bottom of the keyboard. Sadly, the keys aren&#8217;t backlit enabled.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX305UA sports a 13.3-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels, which is quite sufficient for a laptop this size. The display comes with an anti-glare IPS display, which gives crisp and distortion free viewing angles. Moreover, the laptop comes with a 178-degrees side viewing area, meant to provide an uninterrupted viewing experience.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1703 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX305UA Display" width="796" height="550" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display.jpg 796w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display-300x207.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display-768x531.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display-610x421.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display-600x415.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Asus-ZenBook-UX305UA-Display-50x35.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" />The brightness and contrast levels of the laptop are very good and remarkable gaining it a clear upper hand over <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other laptops in the same price range</a>.</p>
<p>During our display benchmarking tests, the ZenBook UX305UA managed to produce 95 percent in the sRGB colour gamut, which is phenomenal. Moreover, the blacks on the screen are punchy and can produce a vivid colour reproduction almost everytime. When it came to the brightness of the screen, it managed to score 410 nits of brightness.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Enough said about the looks and ergonomics of the laptop, coming to the innards of this ultrabook, the ASUS ZenBook comes with an equally attractive set of configuration. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the sixth gen Intel core i5 processor paired with a decent 8GB of RAM. Moreover, the processor is clocked at 2.3GHz which makes sure, multiple applications run on the laptop with ease. The processor is although not <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Powered by Intel i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as powerful as the i7</a>, but is surely capable of handling almost any task you throw at it. Thanks to its 8GB of RAM, the multitasking on the laptop works just well.</p>

<p>Storage on the laptop is backed by a 256GB of Solid State Drive, which offers faster read/write operations including faster file transfer speeds. If one is expecting to store a lot of files and data on the laptop, then we would recommend you to have an external hard drive as a 256GB of SSD is better than a normal HDD in terms of speeds and reliability. The laptop doesn&#8217;t provide a CD/DVD writer with respect to its form factor.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX305UA comes with an integrated 1.2-megapixels HD camera. The camera does a pretty decent job, in clicking images(selfies). Moreover, the adjustment time for the image on the frame is pretty quick, which is very vital for video calling. The camera offers a real-time high-quality video chatting and is capable of motion capturing in 30 frames-per-second (fps), which is twice that of most of the other laptops in the segment. Moreover, the laptop comes with a light detecting sensor to deliver an enhanced low-light capturing.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX305UA sports three USB 3.0 port for blazing fast file and data transfers. Moreover, these USB ports offer a faster charge speeds for the devices connected and assure a faster and reliable data transfers. The laptop also offers a Digital Media Card Reader for accessing data from a digital SD card.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The latest sixth-gen Intel core i5 processor, an 8GB of DDR3 RAM, Intel HD 520 integrated graphics are surely a set of powerful configuration.

The 256GB of SSD drive didn&#8217;t disappoint us in any manner and was very fast in both internal and external file transfers. In addition to that, the laptop remains very quiet even under heavy usage, which is very admirable. The laptop does tend to get slightly warm but is near to negligible warmth. All in all, you won&#8217;t notice any performance issues on this laptop.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Asus ZenBook UX305UA comes with Intel HD 520 integrated graphics and therefore, it is not a gaming or graphics stationed laptop. However, during our usage, we felt that the laptop is although not ideal for high-end games, it still can manage a long list of games with ease. During our benchmarking, it managed to score a good 56,582 on 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test. We tried playing games such as Counterstrike and Heroes of the Storm at full HD resolution and the games were pretty much playable at the graphics set to low.</p>

<p>On a conclusive note, this laptop is not for you if gaming is your primary concern, for all others, it can satisfy almost all your requirements with ease. Plus, you are getting all of this in a beautifully crafted aluminium chassis, which adds on to its premium factor.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>ASUS doesn&#8217;t normally provide a strong set of multimedia functionalities in its laptops. That said, the laptops are rather productive than being entertainment stationed. Fortunately, the ASUS ZenBook UX305UA not only comes with a very bright and wide-angle enabled screen, it also comes with powerful stereo speakers made in collaboration with Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEpower. As a result, the ZenBook UX305 allows you to experience an amazing depths and acoustics in almost all forms of music, games, and media.</p>

It also has a set of pre-tuned settings which suits various environments. We played some 4K content on this laptop, and the outcome was a very beautiful, sharp, and striking video along with thumping sound.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is another unique selling point of this laptop, apart from the lightweight and slim chassis. The company touts that the laptop can provide up to 12 hours of continuous usage, but in our real time usage we managed to get over 9 hours of continuous usage, which is still very remarkable. Therefore, irrespective of what your primary use is, this laptop is sure to last you for an entire day under moderate usage. The laptop takes just about 2 hours and 30 minutes for it to charge fully from 0 to 100.</p>
