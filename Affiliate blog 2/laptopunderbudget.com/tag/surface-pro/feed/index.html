										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Microsoft&#8217;s Surface event on Tuesday, Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 made their first appearances. The Surface Pro 6 is a sleek, slim convertible tablet but lacks a certain option.</p>
<h3>Where is the USB C?</h3>
<p>A little birdy has been telling all Surface fans about the two USB-C ports in Microsoft&#8217;s upcoming Surface device since last year.</p>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HCVUCqZoHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You can see in this promotional video, a Surface device prototype with a couple of USB-C ports. Techies were looking forward to this spec being one of the highlights of Microsoft&#8217;s Surface event in New York. But instead, Microsoft decided to skip it all together in their Surface Pro 6 laptop. With the addition of new ports in Surface Go and Surface Book 2, the consistency to be followed for Surface Pro 6 only made sense.</p>
<p>Moorhead said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But I have to say that Microsoft does already have multiple ways to add an external display, which is really the biggest reason to have USB-C.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although disappointing, it does come with some impressive tweaks. And when I say tweaks, I mean that there were no major upgrades to be classified as &#8216;overhauls&#8217;. Given the popularity of Microsoft Surface Pro amongst corporate users, the tech giant may not have wanted to ruin a good thing that they have going on.</p>
<p>The two in one convertible tablet is crafted with a smooth matt black finish, to again &#8211; fit the portfolio of a &#8216;corporate suited device&#8217;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our customers have been asking for black because it is professional and elegant&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Said Raphael Jose, Product Manager of Surface at Microsoft, on CRN at the launch event.</p>
<h3>The insides</h3>
<p>Now for the upgrades, Microsoft Surface Pro 6 boasts an Eighth gen- Intel Core i5 or i7 processors. Microsoft’s Surface chief, Panos Panay, says the company has improved the processing power with the Surface Pro 6. Microsoft stated that the Pro 6 is 67 times faster and efficient than the previous Surface models.</p>
<p>The insides of the machine are claimed to fend off overheating better that is due to the support of quad-core processors and the thermal cooling system in the i7 version. But if you still want to go fanless, try the i5 model.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4210" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Microsoft-Surface-Family-in-New-Black-Color.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Family in New Black Color" width="850" height="478" /></p>
<p>The device can be held up in 3 different positions, the laptop mode, flat out on a surface or a studio mode. It comes with a black matt hinge for propping up top, so the Pro 6 can play your favorite media in this cinematic mode for up to 13.5 hours on a single charge. Apart from the all-day battery life, the extremely portable body and a solid-state drive (SSD), the Surface Pro 6 has moved past the traditional 4GB RAM. Coming just in 8GB or 16GB variants, the Surface Pro 6 will be configurable with 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the detachable keyboard and its compatibility with Surface Pen and Surface Dial has added a touch of creativity to this little gimmick. Microsoft has stepped up the game on the screen display too. With a 12.3 inch screen, the Surface Pro 6 possesses a bright 5 million pixel for a PPI of 267. This is kind of a game changer in terms of displays in the Surface series.</p>
<h3>Pre-orders and Availability</h3>
