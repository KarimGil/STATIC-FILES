										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are no stranger to the <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">Apple event that&#8217;s going to happen on 30 October.</a> Much speculation has been circulating on the web regarding what Apple might unveil next. Several rumors have hinted a few Mac products coming our way including MacBook, iMac, iPad Pro, and an Apple Watch too.</p>
<h2>Apple has registered to sell new devices</h2>
<p>Just when we thought we had the fall event figured out, a new report has resurfaced. According to<a href="https://consomac.fr/news-9503-apple-depose-ses-nouveaux-macs-doctobre-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> a filing at the Eurasian Economic Commission&#8217;s product registry</a>, Apple has requested permission to sell new computers. If you are unaware of the term EEC, it is an organization that regulates and approves the marketing of electronic products on the Eurasian Economic Union grounds.</p>
<p>The filing has been translated from French from the website and includes a few macOS 10.14 running Macs. A series of macOS 10.14 MacBooks were also listed, among which the A1932 model has been found in prior listings too. We are sure that its a laptop model code. However, the only new entries in the list are A1993, A2115, and A2116. This means we can expect at least three new Apple products to be unveiled on October 30.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to another report, a K-12 education order for some Mac products placed recently by a customer was delayed. The order included a MacBook Air, iPad and Apple Pencil out of which only the iPad and Apple Pencil were received. The shipment of MacBook Air was delayed by Apple to 30 October, which sounds far from a coincidence.</p>
<p>Reminiscing to the predictions made by the supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the upcoming MacBook could be a replacement for the existing MacBook Air. The said device is to feature a 13-inch Retina display, replacing the nebulous and outdated display of the MacBook Air. It is also predicted to be embedded with Intel&#8217;s latest 9th generation chipset. To top it off, the entire package will be wrapped with a $1200 worth of bow. On another bright note, we&#8217;d be getting the older MacBook model for just $999.</p>
<p>But, there is still so much that we can presume at the moment. In just 5 more days we&#8217;d have all the answers about the MacBook upgrades that we have been giddily waiting for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more in the making&#8221; is what Apple is tag lining their upcoming event with. This &#8216;sort of&#8217; teaser has sparked a lot of excitement among Apple lovers. The company has already held a gigantic and successful Apple event a little over a month ago in which they released their latest iPhones and Apple Watch. Seems like Apple isn&#8217;t planning on going out of the spotlight anytime soon.</p>
<p>The date Apple has set for Apple’s <a title="Apple Event" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent fall event</a> is October 30, taking place at the <a href="https://www.bam.org/about" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Howard Gilman Opera House </a>in New York City. That&#8217;s right, the venue is different too unlike the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino where they held their previous event in September.</p>
<p>Although, this is not a complete surprise. There have been rumors about the<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-hold-us-ipad-pro-2018/"> iPad revamp</a> since forever and was long overdue as well. It only made sense that Apple would come around this year work on their abandoned tablet series that hadn&#8217;t received a major update since over a year. Apart from the iPad Pro (the most certain unveiling), there are a few more innovations that we are expecting to be a part of this event.</p>
<h3>What could be &#8216;in the making&#8217;?</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s our take on what Apple users should be expecting in the 30 Oct reveal.</p>
<h4>The iPad Pro (of course)</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4282" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/https_2F2Fblogs-images.forbes.com2Fdavidphelan2Ffiles2F20182F092FiPad-Pro-12-9-2018-5K1-1068x580.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="298" /></p>
<p>We are expecting a dual iPad Pro reveal from Apple to make up for the lost time. The 11-inch size and a redesigned 12.9-inch size iPad. The size variety may come with the introduction to Face ID, USB C port, and a notch less design but with the loss of Touch ID and Smart Connector.</p>
<h4>The MacBook</h4>
<p>The 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pros were updated back in July without any formal event. Nonetheless, we do expect at least 1 major <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/macbook-air-upgrade-apple-fall-event/">MacBook update</a> to be a part of their fall get together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3588 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="logic-pro-x-touch-bar-support-macbook-pro" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>We think that Apple might replace their customary 12-inch MacBook with a 13-inch version. According to past resurfaced reports, the company is aiming at keeping the range between $1000-$1500  with the inclusion of Touch ID and the exclusion of Touch Bar.</p>
<h4>The iMac</h4>
<p>The new hardware of the improved iMac is said to have “significant display-performance upgrades”.</p>
<p>According to past rumors, the MacBook Pro might include the True Tone display support. This allows an adjustment to the color temperature based on lighting ambiance, although it’s still debatable if it only refers to True Tone on the iMac.</p>
<h4>The Mac mini</h4>
<p>Among all outdated Apple devices, the Mac mini certainly takes the cake. Still possessing the 2014 hardware, the Mac mini could be bumped up majorly according to rumors that were circulated in August 2018.</p>
<p>Apple will be focusing on facilitating the needs of Pro users in their 2018 refresh according to Mark Gurman and Debby Wu. Like every other Apple upgrade, higher specs mean higher prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is also planning the first upgrade to the Mac mini in about four years. It’s a Mac desktop that doesn’t include a screen, keyboard, or mouse in the box and costs $500. The computer has been favored because of its lower price, and it’s popular with app developers, those running home media centers, and server farm managers. For this year’s model, Apple is focusing primarily on these pro users, and new storage and processor options are likely to make it more expensive than previous versions, the people said.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The AirPods and AirPower</h4>
<p>Techies are expecting Apple to come forward with their previously announced AirPower wireless charging pad and the wireless charging case for AirPods earphones.</p>
<p>The company teased the reveal in September with an updated version of AirPods including Hey Siri support before the event. The products were surprisingly not mentioned in the following event and yet remain to be seen.</p>
<h4>The OS updates</h4>
<p>Apple might grab the opportunity to release details about their latest OS updates that have been in Beta testing since September. Yes, we are expecting the debut of the iOS 12.1 and the macOS 10.14.1.</p>
<p>With these updates, Apple might release the long-awaited multi-caller Group Face time feature and audio chats. This, along with the support for dual SIM functionality that is going to enable the Series 4’s EKG functionality.</p>
<p>The watchOS may too be getting ahead and include the  ECG support for U.S. Apple Watch users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been the talk of the town that Apple might be planning to fully seize the holiday opportunity and finally unveil their long-awaited iPad Pro, MacBook and MacBook Air devices. According to recent updates, the Apple event is not afar and October could be the month holding the Fall 2018 event.</p>
<p>If we recall the &#8216;Gather Round&#8217; event Apple held in September, it was solely for Apple&#8217;s new iPhone series and Apple watches. Now new iPad and MacBook releases aren&#8217;t usually coupled with iPhone releases. Apple missing out on them in their last event might just mean that they are planning to make a comeback. Much like they did back in 2016 to bring the refreshed MacBook Pros in the market after a few weeks of their iPhone 7 release.</p>
<h2>Do we see a MacBook Air upgrade?</h2>
<p>For over a year we have been caught in the hopes of a 13-inch low priced MacBook Air. We don&#8217;t know if the device will be called &#8216;Air&#8217; for that matter. Apple could place them in the 12-inch MacBook family or the MacBook Air series. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-20/apple-is-said-to-plan-revamped-low-cost-macs-to-reignite-sales">Bloomberg</a>, the design of the new MacBook might be inspired by the Air family.</p>
<p>It is expected that the new MacBook will be handy for schools, students and bargain hunters given its easy on the pocket price tag. That also means that Apple is reaching out to its consumers who were put off by the $1300 price tag on their 12-inch MacBooks. But that was back in 2015.</p>
<p>The current MacBook Air does lack a good screen so, as an upgrade, the new laptop will be featuring a &#8216;Retina display&#8217; as well as slimmer bezels from the MacBook Pro. Another expected improvement in the MacBooks might be its processors as the last boost Apple gave to it was in 2017  but even then, it was not a mentionable upgrade. I think that the Whiskey Lake chip released by Intel a few months ago might just have opened an opportunity for Apple to bump up their outdated MacBook Airs which are still running on 5th gen processors.</p>
<p>Considering Apple is going to market the new MacBook &#8216;Air&#8217; towards light pocketed users, the device should cost from $800 to $1200. But we have reason to believe that it&#8217;s going to be for $1000.</p>
<h3>Is a 12-inch MacBook in the picture?</h3>
<p>Apart from the MacBook Air rumors, there have also been news that Apple might also be planning to expand their much popular MacBook family.  Similar to MacBook Air, we are expecting a processor boost in MacBooks as well. We believe that the Intel&#8217;s Amber Lake Y series processor (also announced in August) might be the best fit for this machine since improved battery performance and processing power is just what MacBooks need at the moment.</p>
<p>At this point, it&#8217;s all speculation since Apple has been too clammed up regarding their Fall event, let alone the expected releases of their MacBooks. But if Apple focuses on their MacBook Air series with the upgrade that they rightfully deserve, they might just knock-off the 12-inch MacBooks off the big shelves at that too with a cheaper tag.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: October 18 &#8211;</strong> <em>Apple will hold its Fall Event Focusing iPad and MacBook on 30th October (<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/apple-confirmed-fall-event-ipad-pro-macbook-october-30/">Read full story</a>)</em></p>
