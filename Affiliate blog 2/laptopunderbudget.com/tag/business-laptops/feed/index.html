										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re an owner of a small business&nbsp;or a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;enterprise, an accounting software is something that every business&nbsp;needs these days. And, when it comes to accounting software, the first name that hits our mind is QuickBooks because it&#8217;s really an&nbsp;easy to use and all-in-one accounting software&nbsp;to manage any type of&nbsp;business. So, are you looking for a&nbsp;laptop for&nbsp;quickbooks to manage your business but&nbsp;not sure which one to get? No problem! Here is a detailed guide to buy the best business laptop for accounting on quickbooks.<span id="more-2254"></span></p>
<p>Buying a laptop for niche specific use is easier than buying a laptop for generic uses and when it comes to buying a laptop exclusively for&nbsp;one accounting&nbsp;software, sifting and selecting&nbsp;the best laptop becomes a lot more easier.</p>
<p>All you need to do is check the system requirements recommended by&nbsp;Intuit QuickBooks and pick the laptop with same or better specifications than recommended. Sounds easy. Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><em>Well, it is a lot more confusing than you think, keep reading to know why.</em></p>
<p>Here are the minimum hardware specifications recommended for Quickbooks <em>(as listed on their website)</em> &#8211;</p>

	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>
	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Minimum System Requirements for QuickBooks 2019</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>2.4 GHz processor minimum</li>
<li>4 GB RAM minimum, 8GB RAM Recommended</li>
<li>DVD drive to&nbsp;install quickbooks from CD (Not required if you download quickbooks from Intuit server)</li>
<li>Minimum Display Resolution &#8211;&nbsp;1280 x 1024</li>
<li>2.5 GB of disk space (additional space required for data files)</li>

<p>These are the minimum system requirements for Quickbooks for Desktop&nbsp;but quickbooks comes in&nbsp;two different variants. The first one is&nbsp;<strong>QuickBooks for desktop</strong>&nbsp;which we download or&nbsp;install locally from the CD/DVD on our computer and the second one is <strong>Quickbooks online</strong> which we can directly access from the normal internet browser just like any other websites.</p>
<p>Now, the next question that might be hitting your mind right now is &#8211;</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">

	</div><h5>Do I need laptop with same specifications as<em> &#8216;<strong>QuickBooks for Desktop</strong>&#8216; </em>to use<em> &#8216;<strong>QuickBooks Online</strong>&#8216;</em>?</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Answer is </em><strong>NO!</strong></p>
<p>Unlike QuickBooks for Desktop, the&nbsp;QuickBooks Online is actually&nbsp;<a title="What is Software as a Service?" href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Software-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">S<em>oftware as a Service (SAAS)</em></a>.

Just&nbsp;make sure that it runs web browser perfectly&nbsp;and has the wifi internet connectivity.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IDoLxK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2351 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/acer-aspire-e-15-e5-575-33bm-156-inch-full-hd-notebook-intel-core-i3-7100u.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15.6-Inch Full HD Notebook" width="500" height="376"></a>This Acer Aspire laptop will rank higher among the most economical yet high-performing business laptops. That said, <a title="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) Review – The Best Budget Laptop of 2018?" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e-15-e5-576-392h-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H</a>&nbsp;is an affordable, stylish and the most performance oriented laptop in the segment. This laptop caters to a wider audience with its high-performance configuration and other useful features.</p>
<p>It has 1TB of HDD which will let you store all your work files, favorite movies, TV shows and music on this laptop and still you will have plenty of space left to store other things. Business owners and accountants can get uninterrupted quickbooks experience with this laptop because it stays juiced up to 13 hours which will allow you to go a little more productive as the laptop lasts long. While the ones interested in entertainment can go into the woods and enjoy movies, the workaholics can also access some exquisite features of Windows 10 and make their work easier with the long-list of productive softwares on the laptop. The QuickBooks is an addition that will help individuals and professional accountants manage their expenses efficiently.</p>
<p>Well! With the eighth generation Intel core i3 processor and 1TB of HDD the only thing this laptop lacks is a good RAM. Although the 6GB of RAM on this laptop runs quickbooks completely fine, the RAM is not a perfect fit for the core i3 processor and 1TB of HDD, yet considering the budget, it&#8217;s still a steal at the asking price.</p>
<p><em>Note &#8211; This laptop does come with extra RAM slot so you can upgrade the RAM of this laptop.</em></p>

Its performance and long lasting battery are good enough features to enamour businesspeople towards this laptop.</p>
<p>Apple MacBook Pro loses out to competition when it comes to storage space; the 128GB of flash storage in the entry level model is way less when compared to other laptops in the same range but it is way more faster than other contending laptops and it is enough for accounting on quickbooks. The 8GB of RAM can queue a lot of files at the same time for the quad core Intel i5 processor to process and help individuals achieve the much-required efficiency at work. Working on QuickBooks on this laptop is going to be a pleasing experience because of the fluidity that refined macOS offers.</p>
<p>The backlit keyboard with touch bar, its efficient processing power, long-lasting battery life of over 10 hours makes the MacBook Pro a worthy contender by all means.</p>

<h3>8. Dell XPS 13</h3>

The laptop comes with sleek and stylish built, premium looks, and very good aesthetics making it easy to carry around. Dell XPS is designed to cater quality graphics; one can always use this laptop for enjoying the best of games and movies.</p>
<p>The 8th generation (Whiskey Lake) Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM work in synchronization like never before to provide with an exceptional Windows computing experience.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has worked through and through on their Elite 800 series notebooks and have come up with not just refined functionalities but have equipped the new editions with over the charts hardware as well.</p>
<h3>Improved malware protection</h3>
<p>More specifically, HP&#8217;s clamshell designed EliteBook 830 G6, EliteBook 840 G6, EliteBook 850 G6 and the convertible EliteBook x360 830 G6 are getting an upgrade. Starting with the most notable one, the Sure Sense technology. If you are not familiar with the concept, Sure Sense is an advanced malware detection program that works alongside Windows Defender.</p>
<p>HP recognized Sure Sense as a cutting edge technology instead of just another anti-virus due to its light footprint on your machine. HP claims that running Sure Sense won&#8217;t choke your system&#8217;s arteries and would work seamlessly even without an active internet connection. These are alongside Sure Sense&#8217;s obvious characteristics: lightweight performance capabilities, ability to flag known and unknown ransomware and HP Sure Click. Sure Click will be the system&#8217;s defence mechanism which sandboxes browser tabs and allows you to browse untrusted websites and open suspicious attachments in a protected virtual environment.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new with the hardware</h3>
<p>HP has equipped the EliteBook 830 G6, HP EliteBook 840 G6, and HP EliteBook 850 G6, and the HP EliteBook x360 830 G6 with a privacy shutter to save you from prying eyes, a whopping 18 hour battery backup, and a 1,000-nit screen.</p>
<p>The Elitebook 830 G6 and EliteBook x360 830 G6 will come with a Core i3-8145U additional option while Core i5-8265U and Core i7-8565 Whiskey Lake processor options are common for all four editions in this lineup. The options of memory go up to 32GB for RAM and up to 512GB for SSD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_5513" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5513" class="size-full wp-image-5513" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HP-Elitebook-800-Series-Notebooks.jpg" alt="HP Elitebook 800 Series Notebooks" width="1217" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5513" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit &#8211; HP</em></p></div>
<p>The editions vary in screen sizes as well. The EliteBook 830 G6 and x360 830 G6 will come with 13.3-inch displays. Whereas the 840 G6 rocks a 14-inch panel and the 850 G6 is a 15-inch laptop. You can also get additional custom specs with the 14-inch EliteBook 840 G6 and 15.6-inch EliteBook 850 G6 and add a Radeon RX 550 GPU. So there are a lot of options to go about here.</p>
<p>The EliteBook G6 however, has been specially blessed by HP with an embedded touch sensor and an in-built webcam cover. However, the EliteBook x360 830 will star an anti-glare, glossy or Sure View touchscreen display.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s left</h4>
<p>Elitebooks in 2019, will have full support for 4G LTE data connectivity, the latest Wi-Fi 6 standards, Bluetooth 5 and HP&#8217;s Extended Range Wireless LAN technology. One thing we know here for certain is that the Elitebooks will leave no room for a patchy, disruptive browsing experience and will ensure reliable connectivity to other peripherals as well.</p>
<p>While little is known about the pricing of Elitebooks, but we can most certainly be sure that they won&#8217;t be cheap. The Elitebooks will start hitting the shelves in May with only x360 830 G6 to be available in June.</p>

The company has been referring the latest release as their &#8220;lightest and thinnest professional notebook&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>Acer is rooting for this laptop to appeal to travelers and, business professionals. The category of users who are always on their feet, hence their emphasis on it being the lightest and thinnest notebook.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>
<p>Well, technically the TravelMate X514-51 comes with the same thickness as the TravelMate X3410 but is &#8216;lighter&#8217; in a sense that it weighs just 2.1 pounds vs. the 3.7 pounds X3410. The chopped of pounds ultimately means losing a few key features as well, which in this case is the full-sized SD reader and legacy VGA port.</p>
<p>The TravelMate X514-51 boasts a magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminum alloy chassis which makes it possible for durability and portability to coexist. However, do not be fooled by its spindly body as even with a small form factor, Acer has managed to pack it with a fair amount of power.</p>
<p>Inside this Windows 10 laptop, you will find up to 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processors, up to 512GB of SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM with a 14-inch FHD 1080p touch display. There is also a backlit keyboard, a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello alongside a 720p webcam. Acer claims that apart from the TravelMate being light on the body and hefty on the specs, the laptop can give up to 10 hours of battery backup. Of course, it sounds highly unlikely, but we can&#8217;t be certain until we actually review the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_5393" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-image-5393 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Acer-TravelMate-X5-2019.jpg" alt="Acer TravelMate X5 - 2019" width="857" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer TravelMate X5</strong> | Image &#8211; Acer</em></p></div>
<p>What we felt they left out of the equation was any mention of Nvidia or AMD GPU options and port selection. Some of the things the manufacturer let go of while building the small form factor of the machine we suspect. However, we do see a USB Type-A port in the pictures of the laptop which I assume is essential in business laptops.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>A little pricier than the TravelMate X3410, the TravelMate X514-51 will be rolled out in June, starting at $1,099.99. This price will buy you a Core i5, 8GB DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can always bump it up with a Core i7, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM, and up to a 512GB SSD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is making the move to the red team, releasing two new AMD-Powered HP ProBook models, the 445 G6 and the 455 G6.</p>
<p>Aimed towards small businesses and start-ups alike, both models will feature exclusively Ryzen and Ryzen Pro APUs. But, because the HP ProBook is a business-grade laptop, you&#8217;ll see multiple features that you normally wouldn&#8217;t see in conventional laptops. This includes improved security features, better durability, longer battery life, and an ultra-thin design that&#8217;s all complemented by relatively low asking price.</p>
<h2>The New and Improved AMD-Powered HP ProBook</h2>
<p>For all the flack that AMD has received over the past few years, they have slowly been delivering in the laptop side of things. HP&#8217;s latest decision to arm the HP ProBook should help serve as validation for the once-struggling Intel rival.</p>
<p>Built for the growing business owner, the HP ProBook 445 and 455 will sport a full-aluminum chassis as well as the latest in AMD technology. Both can come with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 2700 APU, which also comes with a Radeon RX Vega 10 GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and plenty of storage with up to a 512GB SSD.</p>
<p>Being that these were made to stand a beating, the newest HP ProBooks passed MIL-STD 810G standard testing and comes equipped with a spill-resistant keyboard.</p>
<p>Finally, at just 0.71-0.75 inches thin, the neat and compact design, paired with its respectable specifications (especially for the price) and batteries rated to last for nearly 12 hours on a single charge, should easily make this business laptop a favorite. Albeit, not for anything remotely close to graphic design. With a screen that emits only over 220 nits of brightness and just over 67 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the display is subpar, to say the least. It also certainly doesn&#8217;t help that the bezels on the screen are a bit thicker.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>HP confirmed that they plan to launch the the sixth-generation of the HP ProBook sometime later in January at a starting price point of $549.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA has been launched against the likes of Dell’ XPS and Lenovo’ Yoga series of laptops. VivoBook is a sleek and stylish laptop, which is powered with ample configuration to give a tough fight to its rivals in the segment. However, the unique selling point of this laptop is its price. The laptop is priced just under $500, which makes it stand out from its competitors.</p>

<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is being publicised as a premium yet affordable all-rounder. And here is our take on this laptop:</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA is a revamped version of the previous VivoBook edition of laptops launched by the company. This time ASUS has been in trend and made its laptops much more elegant, sleek, and stylish. The laptops are also lighter and are marginally thinner than its predecessors and weigh just about 3.7 pounds and come with measurements of 14.2 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches.</p>
<div id="attachment_3097" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-image-3097 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Laptop - Design" width="650" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-3097" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thinner &amp; Lighter (Just 0.8-inch thick and weighs 3.7 pounds)</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop comes with a brushed metal, shiny chassis, in a glittering grey color. The laptop is thicker at the hinge-edge and gradually gets narrower. The design aspects of the VivoBook, we feel, are largely drawn from the likes of the <a title="Check Current Price of MacBook Air on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2hKvugK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple’s MacBook Air</a> externally. The placement of ports, trackpad, keyboard, and other vitals are very similar to the previous generation of VivoBooks, and all in all, the laptop feels quite easy to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3098 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop Review" width="650" height="386" /></p>
<p>Another unique aspect of this laptop is that it comes with an ultra-narrow 0.3-inch ASUS’ proprietary NanoEdge bezel, which gives an amazing 80% of screen-to-body ratio. The bezels on the laptop are fairly negligible and are probably one of the rarest laptops in the market currently to offer such slim bezel display in a laptop at such low price.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, ASUS VivoBook F510UA makes it feels like you have a full-size 15.6” FHD WideView display embedded into a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch display</a>, which not only makes it compact and sleek to use, but also offers wider, bigger, and much better display. On a final note on the design and build quality, the laptop comes with a uniform solid build quality and certainly is beautiful enough to attract the masses.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LED display which is vibrant. As far as the resolution of the display is concerned, it comes with a Full HD display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. As mentioned earlier, the laptop’s WideView makes it look even better, and thanks to its larger display, the viewing angles on this machine are perfect.</p>
<div id="attachment_3099" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-image-3099 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-AH51-Laptop-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop - Display Review" width="800" height="445" /><p id="caption-attachment-3099" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also comes with the ASUS’ proprietary Splendid visual optimization technology, which automatically provides the optimized visuals to the user for almost any kind of content being played. The laptop comes with custom features as well as pre-installed display modes such as Normal, Vivid, Eye-Care, and Manual, which can be accessed and enabled based on the user’s choice. The videos on the screen also turn out to be a visual treat all thanks to the ASUS Tru2Life Video technology which enhances the movie watching experience on this laptop. The display on this device comes with an intelligent set of sensors which optimises the essential visual parameters such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and hue in every pixel to produce vivid and lively imagery.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook F510UA laptop offers a robust set of innards and is undeniably a powerful device on the paper. Let’s have a quick glance at what does the laptop offers. Under the hood, the laptop is powered by the latest and the most advanced, 8th Generation of Intel Core i5-8250U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 1.6GHz which can, however, rattle up to 3.4GHz in its turbo mode.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top Laptops with Intel Core i5 8th Gen Processor</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Multitasking and the applications on the device are handled by an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage department on the laptop is bolstered by a 1TB of HDD, which is although ample amount of storage, still lags behind SSD when it comes to data transfer speeds and efficiency. We hoped that the laptop comes with an SSD storage, this could have been a deadly combination for a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $500</a>. The laptop comes with an integrated graphics coprocessor and doesn’t come with any additional GPU.</p>
<p>VivoBook also comes with a fingerprint sensor to add a layer of security to the device and the data in it. This is certainly one of the rare finds in a laptop priced at this range.</p>
<p>As far as upgradability of the hardware is concerned, the laptop&#8217;s RAM can be upgraded up to 16GB, and its hard drive is also swappable with solid state drive. So, overall ASUS VivoBook F510UA-AH51 Laptop is a future-proof device which not only provides all current generation hardware specifications but also ensures that it stays up to date with time.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The VivoBook comes with a VGA front-facing camera, and like most of the other laptops in the segment, the front camera on the device is just serviceable. It can capture decent images in daylight conditions and fails to add details under low-light. The image rendering of the device’s camera is quick and is able enough to capture fleeting moments during a video call. There’s nothing exceptional about the webcam on this laptop, and at the same time, do note that there’s nothing to complain as well.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the ports and connectivity options on the VivoBook, it comes with a standard set of ports, which is more or less a common practice in most of the laptops. All the ports are uniformly distributed along the two sides of the device.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3103" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Ports and Slots" width="800" height="370" /></p>
<p>The device comes with one USB 3.1 and one USB 3.0 port, for faster, reliable, and efficient data transfers. And, comes with a pair of USB 2.0 ports for adding up additional peripherals. It also houses an HDMI, 3.5mm Audio Jack, and an SD card reader.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop comes with Windows 10 Home variant pre-installed. Windows 10, which is world&#8217;s most used computer operating system, needs no introduction of what it’s capable of. The laptop doesn’t come with any much of the bloatware and is, therefore, fast, efficient, and nag-free. The device, however, does come pre-installed with some of the productive aspects and tools, which ought to increase the overall productivity of the system.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>All thanks to its powerful and most importantly, the latest set of hardware and innards, the VivoBook offers excellent performance for the budget. No matter how strong the specifications are on paper, what actually matters is its real-time usage and performance. And during our usage and hands-on with this sleek and stylish looking laptop, we were satisfied with its overall performance.</p>
<p>The laptop stays quiet and offers decent graphic-based tasks performance. That said, as the laptop doesn’t come with a specific dedicated graphics coprocessor, the gaming on the device might not cater hardcore gamers. However, thankfully, it can handle small to mediocre demanding games quite well, thanks to the Intel&#8217;s integrated UHD 620 graphics.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Multimedia stands as a common stop for all sorts of laptop users. Be it gamers, businessmen, students, regular home purpose, no matter what the need is, a laptop will undeniably be used as a source of multimedia.</p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA comes with Two Built-in Stereo Speakers which provides very powerful and thumping audio output. During our review, we tested the speakers with bass heavy, punchy tracks, accustomed mids, and also treble stationed lean tracks. And to our surprise, the sound was pretty clear on all the occasions.</p>
<p>As far as the videos are concerned, it can handle almost all forms of videos and codecs. 4K and Full HD videos were playing absolutely lag-free and thanks to its wide viewing angles, we actually had a good time watching content on this laptop.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Battery Life</span></p>
<p>The ASUS VivoBook F510UA was one among the very first laptop we tested, which came along with the 8th Gen Intel core processors and we must say, the chipsets are very power efficient and robust. The laptop offers decent battery backup and is probably way ahead of most of its rivals in the segment.</p>
<p>On a single charge, the laptop stays juiced up for about 5-6 hours of continuous usage. It takes just over 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100. The battery type on this laptop is a Li-Ion one, and our final comments on the battery life would be <em>&#8216;The laptop did not fail us in terms of battery life,&#8217;</em> while most others in this price range don&#8217;t provide this good specs and battery life for the price!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2960 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ASUS-VivoBook-F510UA-Full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Not every laptop in the market comes with the latest 8th Gen Intel core processors and decent battery life. Even if they do, they will certainly not look as polished and solid as the ASUS VivoBook F510UA laptop. Moreover, the price point of $500 makes this laptop an unarguably one of the better offerings you can get currently in the market. Provided, you are not looking for a gaming-stationed laptop.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 comes with a matte finish all plastic body, which gives the old school look of a common laptop. On the very first view, there was nothing groundbreaking about the laptop, as far its design and looks are concerned. The laptop although looks a little thick and hefty, it is actually, a very ergonomically built work machine. The laptop comes with the right placement of ports and connectivity slots, and all in all feels way better than its other competitors in the market.</p>
<p>Speaking about the measurements of the laptop, it is 0.9-inch thick with a 15 x 10.1 inch (HWD) built. The laptop weighs close to 5.2 pounds, which we felt was a little heavy for a laptop this calibre. However, it wasn&#8217;t that heavy to be considered as a drawback.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2685" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P-Series-P2540UA-AB51-Business-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop - Design and Build Quality" width="650" height="627"></p>
<p>Space on both the edges of the laptop are well managed and are neatly recessed with ports, connectivity slots, and heat exhaust vents. The keyboard and the trackpad placement on the device are ideal for most cases and feels of superior quality.</p>

<p>Thanks to its very bright and anti-reflective display, the laptop as expected scored a very good, 148 percent in RGB color ratio with the brightness measured around 210 nits, which is again way beyond the other laptops at this price range.

<p>The ASUS P-Series P2540-AB51 laptop comes with Windows 10 Home (64 bit) operating system pre-installed. This is probably the best part of this laptop; The operating system. Windows 10 Home variant has been customised by various laptop vendors and has been baking with unnecessary bloatware. However, on ASUS P2540UA-AB51, the OS doesn&#8217;t have any bloatware and is absolutely the pure Windows OS.</p>

<p>We used the laptop rigorously to run our benchmarking apps and also streamed Full HD and 4K content for hours together.

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As the laptop is bolstered by an integrated Intel HD graphics, the gaming on this laptop is strictly mediocre. With its Intel HD 620 Graphics, the laptop delivers just average graphics rendering. Thankfully, the laptop can still run games, provided they aren&#8217;t graphic heavy. This laptop is not meant for gaming, and therefore, gaming is your primary requirement then this laptop is not for you. However, you can still play low-to-medium graphics enabled games on this laptop with ease.</p>
<p>The titles we ran on this laptop and managed to run smoothly after scaling down the graphics are &#8211; Minecraft (45 fps), Counter Strike &#8211; Global Offensive (40 fps).</p>

<p>The ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is although a business entered all-purpose laptop, it still has the potential to satisfy multimedia stationed users. That said, the laptop can play 4K content with ease and thanks to its bright antiglare display, watching content on this laptop is a delight.</p>
<p>But wait! there’s a catch, the laptop although have a good set of specifications, its speakers aren&#8217;t the best and they tend to get muffled up at higher volumes. The volume levels are also strictly mediocre. Therefore, we’d suggest the users to either go with an additional set of the audio system to aid the laptop.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Here comes the most essential and crucial zone of the laptop, the battery backup. Finding laptops with long-lasting batteries is no less than a herculean task these days. We cannot simply trust the numbers written by laptop manufacturers which are although intended to create the hype.</p>
<p>Thankfully, our current contender, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51, does exceptionally well in this segment.</p>
<p>The laptop provided up slightly over 8 hours of battery backup on a single charge with normal use, which is rather phenomenal in a laptop that is priced below $500! Again that depends upon one&#8217;s usages. While gaming we noticed that the battery backup was dropped to mere 3 hours and we had to plugin the charger which took about 3 hours to completely charge its lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note &#8211; The charging time can be reduced by keeping the laptop in the sleep mode or by shutting down the Windows.</strong></em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2696" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ASUS-P2540UA-AB51-15.6-Inch-Laptop-Battery-Life.jpg" alt="ASUS P2540UA-AB51 15.6 Inch Laptop - Battery Life" width="650" height="653"></p>
<p>The best thing about this laptop is, it has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a removable battery</span> which makes it easy for users to replace the battery pack. So, if you&#8217;re a power user then you can buy another battery of the laptop and the full day battery backup will be just one battery swap away for you.</p>
<p>Considering the specifications the laptop offers and its performance, over 8 hours of battery life, is something which you don&#8217;t often find these days. So, if you are finding a long lasting laptop with performance, enough to meet your everyday tasks, then the <a href="http://amzn.to/2tx8oJY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop</a> is the right choice for you.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2687" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/asus-p-series-p2540ua-ab51-business-laptop-1.jpg" alt="ASUS P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Business Laptop Review" width="500" height="352"></p>
<p>ASUS P2540UA-AB51 laptop is worth the every penny you&#8217;re going to spend on it. The laptop comes with a decent ergonomics, a long list of connectivity options, powerful innards, and a very bright and responsive display. Wait, there’s more, the laptop also comes with a fingerprint sensor for added security and comes with pure Windows OS.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an ideal laptop for your everyday essentials or for business, your search for a laptop under $500 should end here. Look no further and go with this laptop. However, there are few misses on this laptop such as mediocre audio output and lack of powerful gaming performance. If one is ready to overlook the aforementioned two drawbacks, the ASUS P2540UA-AB51 is the ideal one, quite unarguably!</p>

<h3 class="p1">Design</h3>
<p>Few contemporaries might give Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop a tough time when it comes to specifications but in the context of design, it is going to emerge as a winner. The modern day design adds up to the image of new generation laptop; the sleek, stylish and fitting in design makes this laptop the best product for everyone looking forward to do their work in style.</p>
<div id="attachment_2400" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-image-2400 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-15.6-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 15.6- Laptop Design" width="550" height="386" /><p id="caption-attachment-2400" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Icicle Gold Metallic Frame</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The fact that Asus F5556UA is a lightweight laptop, makes it easier for people to chose this particular machine over the others because there are very less laptops in this segment weighing near to 5 lbs. The Asus F556UA weighs 5.1lbs and it is one of the sleekest 15 inch laptop available in the market right now. So all you tech fanatics, who wanted to have something slim in your bag packs, here is the love of your dreams.</p>
<p>Although, Asus F556UA is a slim and sleek laptop, it doesn&#8217;t compromise in offering any of the required ports &amp; slots. For more info on what ports and slots does it offer, continue reading.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The stylish Asus F556UA has a screen quality that will put critics to shame, the quality output and controlled emission of blue-light makes movies more fun and safer. The 15.6-inch Full HD LED-Lit display has a matte coating, which minimizes screen glare and protect eyes against fatigue.</p>
<div id="attachment_2401" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-image-2401 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blue-light-filter-on-Asus-F556UA-AB54-NB-15-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Blue light filter on Asus F556UA-AB54 NB 15 inch Laptop" width="611" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54&#8217;s <em>Eye Care Mode to reduce blue light</em></strong></p></div>
<p>The display panel is way slimmer and stylish when compared to other contemporaries. People who are looking forward to have an affordable laptop with some stylish features can definitely go ahead with this laptop. Even prolonged laptop users like <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops For Programming – A One Stop Shop Guide" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computer programmers</a> are going to love the unique combination of Full HD screen view with eye-protection features.</p>
<p>Color accuracy and brightness levels of display are also up to the par, making it <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">right choice for photo editing pros</a>. Overall display quality of Asus F556UA is really good and there’s hardly any laptop in this segment that can give it a tough competition. I would give five out of five stars to this laptop when it comes to serving people with quality entertainment.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>When it comes to laptop, people think of HDD and RAM as the only legitimate specifications but there’s a lot more to consider like clock speed, processor count and also processor brand. Yes! clock speed and processor count are directly proportional to the speed at which a laptop processes data. That said, the Asus F556UA-AB54 sports a powerful dual core 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U processor which is from the latest 7th Generation family of processors from Intel.</p>
<div id="attachment_2402" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-image-2402 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Asus-F556UA-AB54-Laptop-Hardware-Specifications.jpg" alt="Asus F556UA-AB54 Laptop Hardware Specifications" width="550" height="411" /><p id="caption-attachment-2402" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>256GB SSD | 7th Generation Intel Core i5 Processor | Windows 10 64-bit &#8211; still<em> so slim!</em></strong></p></div>
<p>While Asus F556UA may appear as the thought leader in processor segment but it is bit disappointing with disk space, the laptop comes with a 256GB of SSD, which is neither enough nor in competition with the other contemporaries. Laptops in this segment generally have 1TB of HDD, whereas 500GB of HDD is considered to be the basic. Asus must work on it and release a newer version with doubled disk-space sooner.</p>
<p>Let alone the processor and disk-space, the RAM is designed to empower the already impressive processor speed. The 8GB of RAM will be able to queue up more processes and allow the processor to process them without making the laptop freeze. The smart combination of Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM is going to do wonders for workaholics and entertainment freaks.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>Asus is generally not known for camera quality but with the newly designed display in place, this F556UA produces pretty impressive images. One can easily depend upon this webcam for <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating tutorial videos for youtube</a> and help the tech naysayers out there. Long story short, the webcam on Asus F556UA-AB54 is not the best you can get in segment but it is pretty good for business meetings on Skype.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Unlike the modern day laptops, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is slim and still houses all kind of ports, there’s a USB 2.0, 3.0, Type-C, an HDMI, a DVD+RW, a card reader slot and also 3.5 mm jack for quality audio video output.</p>
<p>So, you get all the ports and slots that you were familiar with on your previous computer and also the newest and fastest USB Type-C port, which is expected to do the wonders with future of computing.</p>
<div id="attachment_2403" style="width: 1015px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-image-2403 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ports-and-Slots-on-Asus-F556UA-15-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Ports and Slots on Asus F556UA 15 Inch Laptop" width="1005" height="265" /><p id="caption-attachment-2403" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Asus F556UA being a laptop with slim &amp; sleek profile provides best in class connectivity.</strong></em></p></div>
<p>I think other laptop manufacturers should learn something from Asus about making slim laptops without compromising on REQUIRED ports and slots!</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA comes pre-installed with Windows 10 64-bit operating system. It is a premium Windows laptop, which ensures free upgrade to all further Windows 10 updates. With that said, the Asus F556UA does come with a few free preloaded software packages which are &#8220;actually useful&#8221;. Asus F556UA comes with one-year warranty but the customer service of the enterprise is not that great! <a title="Laptop Tech Support Showdown! Our 2017 Ratings" href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/tech-support-showdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer and Dell emerges as a better leader</a> when it comes to providing customers with quality support and after sales support. On top of all these features, the Windows 10&#8217;s proprietary voice-assistance Cortana, is a big added advantage for the potential laptop users, and now it supports multiple languages and regions, making it geographically distinct in terms of support.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Packed with Intel core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, the laptop is designed to cater people with exceptional performance. From students, to employees to artists, this laptop is perfect for anyone with normal to mediocre level of requirements.</p>
<p>The dual core Kaby Lake i5-7200U processor has the base clock frequency of 2.5GHz and turbo boost frequency up to 3.10GHz. The processor has got all the caliber required to run and accommodate almost all the apps very smoothly without much lag. The laptop during our review, did respond well to the inputs and all the hardcore apps we threw at it.</p>
<div id="attachment_2405" style="width: 903px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-image-2405 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Performance-review-of-Asus-F556UA-laptop.jpg" alt="Performance review of Asus F556UA laptop" width="893" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-2405" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS IceCool Technology keeps laptop always COOL and STABLE</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The laptop also responds very efficiently when a series of programs are launched simultaneously. One can definitely multi-task on this laptop without witnessing an iota of heat being produced. It also has the smart Asus ice-cool technology which controls inside temperature of the laptop and makes sure that the laptop always stay at comfortable temperature.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop is going to rank par above the contemporaries because the Full HD LED-lit 15 inch screen and the pitch perfect audio makes it easier for the artists to note the nitty gritty of each and every songs. The output through 3.5mm jack is an immaculate example of quality. One can finally posses a laptop that produces exceptional stereo output and is in the <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">range of $500</a>. The laptop comes with the ASUS’s proprietary <strong>SonicMaster audio technology</strong> meant to fine-tune the audio output. It was developed with the clear goal of giving you the best notebook PC audio. It supports a long list of professional codecs to ensures precise sound performance. In addition to all these, it has an optimised amplifier to deliver louder volumes and deeper bass.</p>
<div id="attachment_2406" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-image-2406 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SonicMaster-Powered-Immersive-Audio-and-Video-Experience.jpg" alt="SonicMaster Powered Immersive Audio and Video Experience" width="550" height="437" /><p id="caption-attachment-2406" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Pitch-perfect Audio</strong></em></p></div>
<p>To test the video playback abilities of the Asus F556UA-AB54 laptop, we ran a set of HD, Full HD, and 4K content on it, to which the laptop responded really well. The detailing of the screen and the sound quality were simply superb thanks to its powerful speakers and bright display panel.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>This laptop is certainly not designed specifically for gaming but one can always run some old games on this laptop with great ease. Designed to leverage people with an exceptional working experience, this laptop is packed with specifications that can run some of your most favorite games with great ease. The laptop may lose when it comes to graphic output capacity because of lack of dedicated cards but the quality is certainly not poor. That said, it can run quite a good menu of games from the market, and being powered by the Windows 10 OS, the laptop supports a wide-range of games and apps to choose from. The modern games from the current market catalogue are also pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Asus F556UA is packed with a 38-Whr-polymer battery which performans 2.5 times better than the standard Li-ion battery. It was compulsory for this laptop to have a long lasting battery because of the Full HD display that it is fitted with. The exceptional battery-life is going to make easier for people to go on and on without looking for a charger every now and then. The Li-polymer battery retains its 80% charge capacity even after completing hundreds of charge cycles. The battery also complies with the highest safety standards, which makes it radiation proof. During our usage, the laptop lasted for slightly over 6 hours, under heavy usage and it gets charged from 0 to 100 in around 3 hours, which is rather good.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<div id="attachment_2407" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-image-2407 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ASUS-F556UA-AB54-NB-15.622-FHD-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop Review" width="550" height="393" /><p id="caption-attachment-2407" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>ASUS F556UA-AB54 NB 15.6 FHD Laptop</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Asus F556UA emerges as winner when it comes to processing power, quality entertainment and leveraging healthier experience but fails to impress people with storage capacity.</p>
<p>The top-notch performance with audio-video output is going to win hearts and make people crave for more and more. We are pretty impressed with Asus F556UA when it comes to audio-video experience; we love the way it makes it easier for people to continue binge-watching movies without feeling restrained.</p>
<p>Like every other laptop in market, the Asus F556UA-AB54 is also not the perfect laptop. It has little dim display and the storage provided on the laptop is also not adequate for most of the users but if you&#8217;re fine with these cons then it is one of the best laptop you can buy in $700 price range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ASUS ZenBooks have always managed to attract us. We&#8217;re not just saying in terms of the looks and design aesthetics, but in terms of overall performance as well. These laptops offer a lot of powerful hardware paired with futuristic features at a budget.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our current contender, the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54, is also launched with the similar expectations and is promised to deliver sturdy performance with an impressive list of specifications. On top of all this, the laptop comes in an all-metal finished shiny chassis, which also adds on the premium aspects of the laptop. All these priced at around $700 makes this a worthy contender in the current laptop’s market and thus, we&#8217;ve decided to review this for our audience. Drill down till the bottom of our review to know everything about this laptop.<span id="more-2020"></span></p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, almost all the ultrabooks these days looks akin to the Apple’s very own <a title="Checkout All MacBooks on Amazon" href="http://amzn.to/2kPOuqp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBooks</a> in terms of the overall form-factor and design. And the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 laptop is no exception in this case as well. There are a lot of similarities in the design of the ZenBook UX330UA and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple MacBook Air</a>. They are almost identical in size and weight and shares similar design hues, including chunkier bezels around the display, curved panel along the edges, and keyboard’s layout.</p>

<div id="attachment_2025" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2025" class="size-full wp-image-2025" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Laptop Design" width="513" height="600" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg 513w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-257x300.jpg 257w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13.3-Inch-Laptop-Design-43x50.jpg 43w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Solid Aluminum Build</strong></p></div>
<p>Here come the other design aspects, which are not like the MacBook. The metal borders around the display are chunky and come with a large protective layer, which although looks a little awkward, but adds up to the protection of the device. The overall premium metallic shiny outer bezels on the laptop are through a layer of tiny metallic particles, on top of premium aerospace-grade aluminium, making it quite different from that of an all-metallic chassis of a MacBook.</p>
<div id="attachment_2026" style="width: 737px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-image-2026 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop Design" width="727" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design.jpg 727w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-300x206.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-610x420.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-600x413.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Design-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Asus UX330UA-AH54 weighs less than 3 pounds and is just 13.5mm thick!</strong></p></div>
<p>Speaking about the sides of the laptop, there are all types of ports and connectivity slots included on both sides of the laptop. We will discuss on ports and slots in more depth later in this review. On an overall note, the ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 certainly looks a lot better than most of its rivals in the segment and is surely an eye-catcher in terms of the overall design.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook sports a 13.3-inch wide-view anti-glare display protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. The display on the laptop is a LED matte panel which comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The display on the laptop is also bolstered by the IPS technology, known for providing clear and vivid display quality. The display on the laptop is a wide viewing angle which covers up to 178 degrees, for better viewing. The laptop offers a colour gamut of 72%, which is on par with most of the current display panels in this budget.</p>

<p>Moreover, during our usage, we never felt eye strains even after very prolonged usage, which is a very good aspect of this laptop. We also ran few benchmarks on the ZenBook and were surprised to look at how well the laptop’s display fares in real-time usage. In terms of brightness, the laptop offers 420 nits, which is adequate and bright even under direct sunlight. We noticed that blacks on the screen to be very accurate and punchy, which gives it the right depth of colour and image on the display.</p>
<div id="attachment_2028" style="width: 939px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2028" class="wp-image-2028 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review.png" alt="Asus Zenbook UX330UA-AH54 Laptop Review" width="929" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review.png 929w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review-300x161.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review-768x413.png 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review-610x328.png 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review-600x323.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Asus-Zenbook-UX330UA-AH54-Laptop-Review-50x27.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Asus Eye Care Mode reduce emissions of blue lights to keep your eyes free from getting fatigue while prolonged usage of laptop.</strong></p></div>
<p>All in all, the display on the Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 is really a strong point for the laptop.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Speaking of the hardware and configuration the ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 offers, under the hood, the laptop is powered by a latest 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor, which comes with a clock speed of 2.5 GHz. However, the laptop can be rattled under its full potential of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. For application handling and multitasking, the laptop is provided with an 8GB of DDR3 RAM, which we felt to be a little outdated, considering its rivals having a DDR4 enabled RAMs. However, it&#8217;s the perfect blend of processor and RAM on this laptop, which didn&#8217;t let us down throughout our usage.</p>

<p>As far as the storage on this laptop concerned, it comes with a 256GB of SSD storage, which should suffice most of your data. The laptop comes with a fingerprint scanner, which is a unique feature in laptops. This not only adds up to the versatility of the laptop but also ensures safety and security of the user’s privacy. For the gaming and graphics related niches, the laptop comes with the latest integrated Intel HD 620 Graphics, which although isn&#8217;t as powerful as Nvidia but is surely capable of handling most of the daily graphic related usage.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 ultrabook comes with an HD webcam and the camera on the laptop is strictly average. Even under bright lighting conditions, we felt the image on the display was blurry and murky. However, the camera is quick at adjusting the image on the display and is, therefore, manageable for occasional video calls.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Being an ultrabook, the Asus Zenbook UX330UA doesn&#8217;t compromise on any connectivity options. Most importantly, it sports a 3.5mm audio jack which many laptop manufacturers are planning to get rid of.</p>

<p>The laptop offers two USB 3.0 ports for faster, efficient, and reliable file transfers and a <a title="USB Type-C Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USB Type-C port</a> to deliver up to 10 times faster data transfers. In addition to them, this laptop also comes with a USB Charger+, a Micro-HDMI port, and a Micro-SD card slot.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 13.3 Inch Ultra-Slim Laptop runs Windows 10 home out-of-the-box. The software on the laptop works just fine as that of any other laptop running Windows 10. The software on the laptop is productive, efficient, fast, and reliable but has its own drawbacks. The laptop is stuffed with some bloatware, which we felt was quite unnecessary for most of the users.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the ZenBook comes stuffed with a latest seventh gen intel core i5 processor paired with an 8GB of RAM. This duo is now commonly seen on most of the latest laptops at this budget. Although these specifications are any groundbreaking, they certainly offer very reliable and stable overall performance. The RAM and system memory is very well managed in this ultrabook.</p>
<p>During our usage, we&#8217;ve put the laptop to its full potential. We ran multiple RAM and processing power consuming benchmarking apps to which the laptop responded really well. Switching between apps, multitasking, gesture support, and other essential performance aspects on this laptop are pretty convincing. During our entire usage, we hardly noticed a performance issues. In fact, we loved how the laptop responded to the heavy applications.</p>

<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Speaking about the gaming aspect of the laptop, it comes with an integrated Intel HD 620 graphics, which is one of the most advanced graphics integrated with an Intel chipset. The graphic reproduction and handling of the laptop are pretty neat and tidy. Although one cannot expect a powerful gaming experience on this laptop, almost all the modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The ASUS ZenBook 3 is unarguably a multimedia-stationed laptop. This aforementioned statement is bolstered by its powerful Harman Kardon audio paired with ASUS’s proprietary Golden Ear team to produce an unmatched and unsurpassed distortion-free sound. The laptop comes with the SonicMaster technology for tuning audio and sports a 4-Channel, 5-magnet enabled, Quad-Speakers for a powerful audio experience.</p>

<p>Moreover, the laptop also comes with a smart-Amp audio technology option, which lets you setup the audio as per the user’s choice. Speaking about the video playback abilities, the laptop can play 4K content with ease, and thanks to its super wide viewing angles, watching videos on this laptop is a pleasure.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Speaking about battery life of the ASUS ZenBook, the laptop is fuelled with a 57 Wh polymer battery pack. The battery packed in the laptop is pretty much sufficient to provide a backup of around 5-10 hours based on the usage. The laptop can be fully charged in around 2 hours 30 minutes. During our review, the laptop survived for 8 hours in video playback test, where we played 4k content with around 40% of brightness. Do note that, these figures can increase or decrease based on the usage. On a conclusive note, the battery could have been much better for a laptop this calibre as the MacBook Air with the almost similar set of configuration lasts at least 3 hours more than our current contender.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1932" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg" alt="Asus ZenBook UX330UA-AH54-Best-Ultrabook-Under-$700" width="550" height="320" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-300x175.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-515x300.jpg 515w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Asus-ZenBook-UX330UA-AH54-13-Inc-Laptop-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />With all that said, we’d like to conclude saying that the ASUS ZenBook is undoubtedly one of the most polished and performance-oriented laptops in the segment. The laptop has few weaker zones, but thankfully, it also has a lot of other aspects which are very well-tuned making it an able <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contender in around a budget of $700</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for an eye-catchy premium looking daily performer, then the ASUS ZenBook is surely a worth considering option. Also note that there are hardly any able laptops in this price range and you&#8217;ll need to spend few hundreds additionally to get a better option such as Dell XPS 13, or the MacBook Air.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the HP ENVY 13-ab016nr is a premium looking laptop, which is very sleek and ergonomic. The Envy 13 comes with a completely refreshed design aesthetics and looks simply irresistible measuring 8.9 x 12.8 x 0.6 inches. Like the legendary, MacBook Pro, the laptop is completely recessed in an aluminium chassis but is pretty light, and weighs just around 3.3 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1986" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Review" width="300" height="280" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Review-50x47.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At the first glance itself, we could see a lot of similarities between the Envy 13 and a MacBook. Although there are certainly remarkable differences in the design and built, the similarities are very evident. The laptop’s lid comes with black bezels, giving a better highlight to the screen. The laptop maintains a uniform thickness throughout the built, which is very remarkable in the laptop these days. The laptop comes with a lifted hinge, which provides its users with a better and more comfort in typing.</p>
<p>Speaking about other sides of the laptop, to the left there is a charging port, an SD card reader slot, a USB Type-C 3.1 port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. To the right, there are two more USB ports and an HDMI port. The keyboard and the trackpad are also very neatly and spaciously recessed. You also get speaker grills, on the either sides of the keyboard, which thumps the volume directly without any distortion.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The HP ENVY 13-ab016nr laptop sports a 13.3 inch diagonal full HD UWVA eDP display. The display is powered by a bright view WLED-backlit technology and comes with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.</p>
<p>The laptop’s display offers the company’s proprietary Technicolor Color Certification, to deliver true-to-life colors. Although the display offers vivid, bright, and great color gamut, it feels glossy and this affects the viewing angles of the laptop. Due to the glossy coat on the display, the screen is highly reflective, making it tough to use it in bright outdoor conditions. However, we did not face any hiccups with the display during our indoor usage. Moreover, the blacks on the screen are not very punchy, as we’d expect from a laptop this calibre.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1989 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13 ab016nr Notebook Display" width="649" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display.jpg 649w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-300x231.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-610x470.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-600x462.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-Envy-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Display-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" />We also ran few benchmarking apps and tools on this laptop, to which the laptop did fare well. It managed to reproduce 94 percent in the sRGB color gamut, which is very good considering the price range. When it comes to the brightness of the screen, it managed to score 410 nits of brightness.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13- ab016nr Notebook, boasts of some really interesting set of specifications under its chassis. The laptop being one of the latest in the market, does come with all the latest lineup of configuration.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the HP Envy 13 is powered by a latest seventh gen Intel Core i5-7200U processor. The processor is by default clocked at 2.5 GHz, but can certainly obtain a full throttle of up to 3.1GHz in its turbo boost mode. This mode can not only provide you with a punchy performance but also lets you get the most out of the laptop. For handling apps and multitasking, it is equipped with an 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM, which although is not the best you can get in the market, but it certainly is good enough to provide a smoother multitasking.</p>

<p>For all the <a title="Gaming Laptops - Archives" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming and graphics enthusiasts</a>, the laptop is stuffed with an Intel HD 620 graphics, which is good, if not the great. Graphics on this laptop worked well during our review, provided we have our expectations checked.</p>
<p>And finally, now comes the predominant part of the hardware of any laptop—the storage. The HP envy 13-ab016nr laptop offers a 256GB of PCIe NVMe M.2 Solid State Drive, which we feel is a little less and could have been much better if it was anything beyond 500GB. However, the solid state drive is fast, efficient, and more reliable than hard drive for the cause.</p>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13-ab016nr comes with an HP web camera recessed on top of the screen. The webcam provided with the laptop is bolstered by the HP’s proprietary TrueVision HD Webcam. TrueVision, allows you to get vibrant clarity and very good color gamut during the video call sessions, and can also aid in clicking pictures using the laptop. The camera is decent to work with and can also work well in low-lit conditions. All-In-All, the webcam on the Envy 13 does beyond satisfaction being a laptop’s camera.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook sports 3 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports for reliable, and lightning fast data transfers. They also aid you in connecting peripherals with the laptops easily. It also sports an HDMI port and one DisplayPort to extend the display onto another device.</p>

The Envy 13 also comes with a Micro-SD card reader slot to connect with an SD card.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The HP Envy 13 laptop runs Windows 10 out of the box. Windows needs no introduction in the field of laptops as it is the most common, productive, easy-to-use, and reliable OS for laptops. Accordingly, the HP Envy 13 also offers a great UI, thanks to the latest Windows 10, and it also offers all the interesting features of the Windows 10 including Connect with Cortana. Cortana is your new personal assistant in Windows 10 based machines and this works perfectly well with the HP envy 13 ab016nr notebook.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1994" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software.jpg" alt="HP ENVY 13-ab016nr Notebook Software" width="945" height="500" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software.jpg 945w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-300x159.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-768x406.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-610x323.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-600x317.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Notebook-Software-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" />During our review, we faced no issues of hurdles in using Cortana and the laptop was able to identify proper voice commands from us. It also helps in setting reminders, alerts, setting plans, and more, all making it even more productive and fun to use. Some of the additional software which come preloaded are CyberLink PowerDirector, Netflix, and McAfee LiveSafe which can be easily uninstalled if not required.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Thanks to the 7th Gen Kaby Lake intel core i5 processor, the laptop does provide seamless performance in almost all instances. Although you can get a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops with Intel Core i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop powered by intel core i7</a> at this price, it is the generation of processor, which makes a difference here. Kaby Lake series of processors from Intel are undoubted, power-packed processors, and are also very power efficient when compared to its predecessors.</p>
<p>The good 8GB of RAM and the processor runs the show for the Envy 13 and runs really well. During our review and usage, we hardly noticed any issues in the perspective of performance of this laptop. We also throttled the laptop to its limits by running a number of heavy applications such as photoshop, games, and intensive benchmarking applications, and the laptop remained cool and calm, in performing these tasks. Chrome runs absolutely fine even with around 10-15 tabs opened simultaneously, the transition effects, Cortana’s usage, app switching, multitasking, background resource utilities, everything is just perfect with the HP Envy 13-ab016nr, and is, therefore, the most stylish and powerful laptop in its segment.</p>

<p>As far as gaming on this laptop is concerned, it isn&#8217;t any groundbreaking in this segment. Most of the common games run fine on this laptop, but it struggles in handling graphic intensive games when the graphics are set to maximum. Modern games are pretty much playable with the graphics and resolution set to low-medium settings.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the laptop comes with dual stereo speakers on either side of the keyboard. The sound is clear and thanks to the placements of the speakers, the sound is forward stationed and doesn&#8217;t have any distortions like the laptops having speakers beneath or to the side of the chassis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1995" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="274" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers.jpg 960w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-300x86.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-768x219.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-610x174.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-600x171.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HP-ENVY-13-ab016nr-Laptop-Speakers-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />The audio on the laptop is tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen and booming HP Audio Boost, which pretty much pairs up really well to provide a quality sound output. Also, all forms of videos, 4K, UHD, Full HD, and HD played well without stutter.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Battery life is another attractive feature of this laptop, thanks to the slim and sleek built, the laptop offers good battery life than most of its competitors. Although the company claims that the HP Envy 13-ab016nr can provide over 14 hours of continuous usage, in our review we found that it was able to stay alive for around 8-10 hours based on the usage. This is still way better than most of the laptops at its segment. The laptop is powered by HP’s Fast Charge technology, which can charge your device for 90% in just around 90 minutes.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1970" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook" width="500" height="338" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook.jpg 500w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook-300x203.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/HP-13-ab016nr-Notebook-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />All that said, we’d like to conclude our review saying that- you&#8217;ll not regret in the near future buying this <a title="Checkout Other Best Laptops Under $600" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop at this price of around $600</a>. If you want a slim, sleek, sturdy, and a well-built laptop which not only looks premium and good but is also capable of delivering outstanding performance, then look no further, the HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook is probably the best you can get. However, if you&#8217;re ok with carrying the same old chunkier laptops, then you might get some even more powerful laptops at this price range.</p>
