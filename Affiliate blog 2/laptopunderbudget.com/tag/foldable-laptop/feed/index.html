										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have forever been envisaging about foldable devices. The aspiration that started with smartphones and extended to tablets has recently spread to laptops as well. After<a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/lg-lenovo-might-working-13-inch-foldable-tablet/"> LG and Lenovo,</a> Samsung might be up for it too. Turns out that Samsung is working on a foldable display and this came from no other source than Samsung itself.</p>
<p>On the recent event for the unveiling of their Notebook Flash <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20181022000691" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Samsung stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Like foldable smartphones, Samsung is collaborating with display makers to develop laptops with foldable displays that will not just simply fold in and out but create new value and user experience, amid the changing market trends for laptops,”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Lee Min-Cheol, vice president at marketing for PCs at Samsung.</p>
<p>He further added that tech giant is also pursuing the idea of large AMOLED displays for laptops and are actively working on developing it with panel makers.</p>
<p>Foldable laptops are not the first challenge that Samsung has taken up in developing flexible devices. Long before this, Samsung was quite fixated on releasing a foldable smartphone and still is. Though over the years we have come by multiple prototypes of foldable gimmicks but have never actually used one. Crafting a foldable device not just needs a flexible exterior but interior as well and even for organizations like Samsung, bendable chips and processors are impossible to come by.</p>
<h2>What could a foldable device really do?</h2>
<p>Be it a laptop or a phone, making a device foldable could only have one upshot &#8211; PORTABILITY. Being able to carry it around in your pocket or a small saddle bag is what tech companies are rooting for. Because other than that, there is clearly no headway towards hardware or feature development.</p>
<p>Samsung is still tight-lipped about how they will be accomplishing their flexible device idea. It could either mean bending a regular screen or having two side by side screen panels to provide users the look and feel of a wide display.</p>
