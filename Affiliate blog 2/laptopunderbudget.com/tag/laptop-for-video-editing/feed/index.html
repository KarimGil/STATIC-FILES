										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a video editing novice (like yours truly), you might have struggled with several aspects before you could get down to practicing your rudimentary editing skills. It&#8217;s not a big deal though. With the genius pieces of video editing software and computers we have today, it is only a thing of the past that performing intricate video editing tasks were best left to the professionals. Thanks to the dawn of all these revolutionary video editing laptops and softwares, even with limited technical expertise, you can explore the endless prospects 2019 is now offering in the realm of video enhancing.</p>
<p>Although this has to do with a bunch of factors, some of which involve determining what video editor you should use and the machine that will be supporting it. The latter is a bit more complex than it sounds. Shuffling through the range of laptops available currently in the market for basically the video editing, can often be frantic. So we&nbsp;thought you might need a little guide to get you started. Keep reading to gain more insight about the <em><strong>dos and don&#8217;ts when it comes to buying the laptop specifically for video editing</strong></em>&nbsp;and also check out&nbsp;the list of our most recommended video editing laptops&nbsp;with reviews below.</p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">5&nbsp;Things to Consider Before&nbsp;Buying a&nbsp;Video Editing Laptop</h4>
<hr>
<p>Reaching this point, there is quite a typical approach we tend to adopt. Just Google the &#8216;top 10&nbsp;best laptop for video editing&#8217; and pick the one laptop&nbsp;that agrees with your pocket, but if you want to be a video editing guru, there is a lot more to consider than just that. Don’t get me wrong, you could, however, get started just fine with a typical, customary laptop and perform basic video trimmings and add light effects, but as time goes by you will begin encountering some decisive issues which will at that point be unavoidable.</p>
<p>So, give yourself a safe start and analyze different specs which might implicitly influence your video editing activities.</p>
<p>The most common challenges people tend to face are; lack of storage – any high-quality video, will take up a huge chunk of your disk. Now consider a heavily edited HD video. To cram in a bunch of those in your laptop&nbsp;requires a lot more capacity than you can anticipate. Then there are several issues with the horsepower premium video editing softwares require, along with a speedy processor, high-grade graphics and what not.</p>
<p>In this section, I am going to give you a little brief about selecting the best core hardware for video rendering and editing laptop, fragmented into a step-by-step breakdown. So, let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>
<h5><strong>A Powerful Multi-Core&nbsp;Processor</strong></h5>
<p>Know that all your efforts of buying&nbsp;suitable video editing laptop&nbsp;will go in vain if you don’t buy the laptop with a powerful&nbsp;processor. After all, the processor&nbsp;is going to be your underpinning for advanced editing software, graphics cards, and other necessities. For instance, hardcore video editing softwares&nbsp;like Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, and Final Cut Pro&nbsp;will essentially occupy your CPU’s multiple cores and require hyperthreading.&nbsp;Hence, buying the laptop&nbsp;with&nbsp;multiple core processor with&nbsp;hyperthreading capabilities is&nbsp;certainly the best&nbsp;for video editing.</p>
<p>If you are a little tight on money, there are laptops with AMD CPUs which you can opt for. They might not be the most powerful alternative like Intel, but do provide good value for money. Although of course if you want to keep up with the evolving trends, the best option is to upgrade to a better laptop from time to time. Like at this point of time, you will not find a more powerful alternative than a <a title="The 10 Best Laptops with Intel i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop&nbsp;running Intel’s i7 processor</a> for video&nbsp;rendering. The range of hyperthreaded 4-core, 6-core, and 8-core processors makes it a solid alternative than the others. You can start off with an&nbsp;<strong>i7-9750H or i7-8750H</strong> and after polishing your skills, move to even more robust CPUs like the&nbsp;<strong>i7-9850H, or the flagship i9-9880H</strong>&nbsp;which is capable of doing wonders with 4K video editing.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5693 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/X264-Benchmark-Processor-Score.png" alt="X264 Video Transcoding Intel CPU Stress Test Score" width="533" height="430">The laptops powered by Quad-Core Intel i5 Processors (i5-9300H, i5-8300H) are <strong>CHEAPER&nbsp;and POWERFUL</strong> than the laptops powered by Quad Core Intel i7 Processors (i7-8565U, i7-8550U). So, if you&#8217;re looking for a pocket-friendly laptop for video editing, then <a title="The Best Laptops with Intel i5 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by quad core Intel i5 processor</a> will be&nbsp;best options.</p>
<p></div></div><br />
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>Top-Notch Discrete&nbsp;Graphics</strong></h5>
<p>Depending on the severity of your use, the graphics card has to be powerful enough to speedily render information into high-quality pixels.</p>
<p>For light video editing, you don’t need a&nbsp;laptop with dedicated graphics as&nbsp;integrated graphics on newer generation processors&nbsp;are powerful enough to&nbsp;get the work done&nbsp;but most latest video editing softwares, efficaciously make use of dedicated graphics through hardware acceleration and it would be highly beneficial if you have&nbsp;an A-grade one on your laptop&nbsp;to obtain the best results.</p>
<p>A few good alternates? Of course, the performance and reliability of Nvidia is unmatched, and their GeForce GTX and newest RTX GPUs, is a revolutionary development in itself. Providing improved efficiency, the new GPUs with ray-tracing features is a major breakthrough for not just video editing purposes but for gaming as well.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#5a8e20;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#8DC153;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Quick Tip -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"></p>
<p>If you <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own an extensive gaming laptop</a>, chances are, it would be a good fit for media rendering purposes as well.</p>
<p></div></div>
<p>For the sake of exploring all possibilities, there is Radeon series of GPUs by AMD offering similar specs and performance. To mention a few, the AMD Radeon Pro series graphics processors are the most superior ones in the bunch for video editing laptop. Although Nvidia has proven to be the unspoken king, AMD is catching up, and there are many AMD powered laptops which give Nvidia powered laptops a good run for their money.</p>
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>Giant Amount of Storage Space</strong></h5>
<p>Of course, you need to store all your edited videos. If you are getting down to some serious motion graphics editing, you should have a few gigabytes to spare on your laptop. If not, there is always a possibility of ramming your files into an external SSD. You could, however, go with a cheaper, hard drive alternative, but from performance perspectives, I’d recommend a good SSD to go with your video editing machine.</p>
<p><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/33n7WQT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">External drives</a>&nbsp;are known to provide better and more reliable accommodation for your media files than built-in ones. But if you are a frequent traveler, there are&nbsp;some good laptops having a good go-to storage space (You&#8217;ll find them in the list of our top laptop picks below).</p>
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>RAM &#8211; The more the better</strong></h5>
<p>If you don’t want to slam shut your laptop amidst video&nbsp;editing because of unavoidable lagging, buy a&nbsp;laptop with a good amount of RAM. Finding a ‘suitable amount’ of RAM depends massively on your use. If you are working on full HD videos (1920 x 1080), then your computer with a built-in 8&nbsp;to 12 GB RAM&nbsp;would be enough to get you going. For more advanced video resolutions&nbsp;like 4K (and&nbsp;8K), I’d advice to bump your RAM up a notch or just upgrade your laptop.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, you won’t regret spending bucks on an expanded RAM; that is if your budget allows. A good intermittent backup and uninterrupted playback go a long way while professional video editing and this is all due credit to a powerful RAM.</p>
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>High-Resolution Display</strong></h5>
<p>The display is another important aspect to check&nbsp;in the laptop for video editing. A color-accurate display with sufficient resolution is required to play and edit videos properly. For an instance, editing a 4K video will be best if done on&nbsp;the laptop with a 4K display. That said, one wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable to&nbsp;edit 4K videos on the laptop with the standard 1080p display because that display will be&nbsp;able to fit pixels up to 1920&#215;1080 only, whereas the resolution of 4K (3840&#215;2160) is twice&nbsp;the resolution of full HD. So, having a 4K display on a laptop will surely have an upper hand while editing videos, but certainly it&#8217;s not necessary&nbsp;for everybody to have one!</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e54c;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF66;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<p><em><strong>Note &#8211;</strong> Laptops with 4K resolution display don&#8217;t&nbsp;come cheap, and they also tend to&nbsp;eat a lot of battery power&nbsp;as its hardware has to push everything in 4K resolution. So, don&#8217;t&nbsp;buy a video editing laptop&nbsp;with 4K display unless most of the&nbsp;videos you edit are in&nbsp;4K.</em></p>
<p><em>If you don&#8217;t have to edit videos on-the-go, then we would advise you to buy a 4K monitor separately with your laptop. A <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2IJkzhp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">good one</a> doesn&#8217;t cost much and this way you can have a decent setup when you are editing videos. When you&#8217;re traveling, you can have a laptop with you that has extra battery juice because it doesn&#8217;t have to push extra pixels to accommodate the 4K display.</em></p>

</div>

<p>If all this dense technical hardware jibber jabber is hard for you to digest, or you are just looking for some light, occasional video editing laptop, then you can always opt for a comprehensive laptop, that offers a little of all the essential factors mentioned above.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s begin with&nbsp;the list of our top picks of laptops offering the perfect blend of speed, high-quality display and sufficient storage which makes them the best video editing laptops.</p>

<p>While there are high-end detachable laptops like <a title="See it on HP" href="http://tidd.ly/452b45e8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HP ZBook</a>, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is our top choice of detachable for video editing right now. It is available in two different sizes with 13 or 15 inch pixelsense touchscreen display but we recommend its 15-inch variant for video editing because it comes with more powerful CPU and GPU. It is powered by the newest 8th Gen Intel Core i7 quad-core processor and can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. The biggest reason to opt for a 15 inch variant over 13 inch is the GPU. The 15-inch Surface Book 2 comes with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6 GB of DDR5 graphics memory</span> while the 13-inch variant offers GTX 1050 with 2GB VRAM. So, definitely 15-inch variant is the one you should get if you want to edit and render 4K videos fast and seamlessly.</p>
<p>As far as design and build-quality of the laptop is concerned, the laptop feels very well put together and it is very ergonomically designed laptop. The laptop&#8217;s screen can be completely detached to use it as a tablet and its unique fulcrum hinges allows it to use in various other modes. So, all in all the Microsoft Surface Book 2 with its powerful specs and unique 2-in-1 design is the most versatile laptop available for video editing right now.</p>

<p>The recently launched <a href="https://amzn.to/2MDPhtl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asus ROG Strix Scar III laptop</a> comes in various models based on size and hardware specifications. However, we still love its predecessor, the ROG Strix Scar II laptop, because it offers so much more at affordable rates. It comes with a very powerful Intel 8th Gen i7 six-core processor, and it is perfect for demanding tasks like video editing.</p>
<p>The Scar II is the perfect laptop for people who like to work on bigger displays. It has 17.3 inch full HD IPS 144Hz display with ultra-fast 3ms response time. Although, that high refresh rate won&#8217;t help in video editing but it does smooths out all the transitions and improves overall video editing experience. The perfect display with the high-performance hardware is what makes this laptop one of the best choices for video editing.</p>
<p>With that said, it has a hexa-core coffee lake Intel i7 processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics to backup all your video editing and rendering needs. The multitasking on this laptop is also pretty well managed by its 16GB of RAM and it offers fast and spacious 1TB HDD and 256GB of PCIe SSD to store all your videos locally on the laptop.</p>

<h3 id="L6">6. Apple MacBook Pro 15 with Touch Bar&nbsp;<span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best Mac for Video Editing</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IQzhmH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4856 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MacBook-Pro-15-with-touch-bar.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro with Touch bar - Professional's Recommended Laptop for Video Editing" width="863" height="346"></a></p>
<p>When it comes to content creation, most professionals choose &#8216;Apple&#8217;&nbsp;for their work and when we&#8217;re talking about Video Editing specifically, there&#8217;s no better laptop than the new MacBook Pro with Touch bar. The touch bar on the new MacBook&nbsp;Pro helps a lot while editing videos&nbsp;and if your preferred video editor is <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Final Cut Pro</a>, then it can really do wonders. You can easily scrub through your video timeline using the touch bar without a single mouse click (as shown in the image below). Can video editing get more easier and convenient than this?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="video editing on final cut pro touchbar representation" width="928" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro.jpg 928w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-300x129.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-768x331.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-610x263.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-600x259.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p>Apart from the new touch bar, MacBook Pro comes with a lot of other compelling features too.&nbsp;It has 15.4-inch retina display which is one of the best displays&nbsp;Apple makes currently.&nbsp;The display on the new MacBook Pro can get bright up to whopping 500 nits which is the brightest panel ever made for the laptop computers&nbsp;and it also has 25% more colors than the sRGB so color accuracy and brightness are not an issue here.</p>
<p>On the hardware front, this laptop has latest 9th generation Intel Core i7 six-core 2.6 GHz processor paired with the 16GB of RAM and dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 555x graphics which are good enough specs for editing high-resolution videos. Well, if you want even more power, then you can also configure the <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/32rSW44" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Pro 15 with Intel Core i9 processor</a> and up to Radeon Pro Vega 20 GPU.</p>
<p>The lacking factors of this laptop are its slightly limited storage and limited (very limited actually) choice of ports selection. This laptop has 256GB of SSD which is low and might become a problem if your use involves large media files or editing utilities but if you&#8217;re ready to spend more money then there are MacBook Pro models available with more amount of storage (up to 4TB). The ports that the new MacBook Pro offer, includes only 4 x Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. That&#8217;s it! This will force you to buy and carry the &#8220;dongles&#8221; with you everywhere but this is also where the future is headed, right?</p>
<p>So on a conclusive note, The 2019 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is one of the most powerful, lightweight and advanced laptops for video editing with a steep price tag, but not too steep for video editing professionals who can spend a couple of hundred bucks more for high-grade machinery.</p>

Performance wise this is a pretty abled laptop and can easily handle 1080p and even 4K video editing tasks.</p>
<p>It has 15.6 inches of full HD IPS display which is color accurate and has great viewing angles, but, it doesn&#8217;t get enough bright to use comfortably in well-lighted areas.&nbsp;As far as ports and slots on this laptop are concerned, it provides all the required ones including Thunderbolt USB Type-C port which can support <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>single 5K display or dual 4K display output</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Overall, Dell G5 offers a solid set of features combined with Dell&#8217;s robustness and reliability. Hence, it is the perfect laptop for users who are looking for a video editing laptop under $1000.</p>

<h3 id="L9">9. Acer Aspire 5 <span class="su-label su-label-type-info">Best For Beginners</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/32nPIyB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5695 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Acer-Aspire-5.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 5 A515-54G-5928 - best laptops for video editing under $500" width="550" height="393"></a></p>
<p>The predecessor of this laptop, the <a title="Check Price and Read Reviews on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2MNs5sY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Acer Aspire E 15</a> is still one of the best budget laptops, however, the newer Aspire 5 is also power packed budget machine with a very compelling set of features. The build quality and design are almost same as the previous generation so the changes are only in the hardware that this new variant packs inside.</p>
<p>Assembled with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 quad-core processor, clocked up to 3.9GHz, this laptop on the list can rightly be titled as a <strong>‘BEST BUDGET VIDEO EDITING LAPTOP’</strong>, holding a price tag as low as $650 and fortunately, this cut-throat price tag has no effect on the laptop’s comprehensive specs. Running on a 8GB RAM and holding a 512 GB SSD for storage, this is the best laptop for video editing under $700 for light-pocketed youtubers or students of film major.</p>
<p>It also inhabits a crystal clear LED-backlit 15.6 inches full HD IPS display with tiny bezels. I’d say that this is not at all a bad package to go for the price that it comes with.</p>

<h3 id="L10">10. MSI GT63 TITAN-032 15.6 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2ps8OoM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4822 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MSI-GT63-TITAN-052-15.6-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GT63 Titan-032 15-inch High End Video Editing Laptop" width="600" height="587"></a></p>
<p>Another MSI laptop&nbsp;in our list of video editing laptops which is again a very high-performance machine&nbsp;with similar gaming hued design and build quality. The MSI GT63 Titan is actually&nbsp;a gaming laptop but its performance would be more justified if we will call it as a <strong>&#8220;workstation laptop&#8221;</strong> as it happens to be&nbsp;the most powerful and of course the most expensive laptop we have on the list here.</p>
<p>It is powered by an ultra high-end Intel Core i7-8750H processor with clock frequency of up to <strong>4.1GHz</strong> and has&nbsp;Nvidia&nbsp;GeForce <strong>RTX 2080</strong> 8GB DDR5 graphics. To handle this high-performance hardware, it has 16GB of DDR4 RAM which can be upgraded up to mammoth 64GB!&nbsp;These aren&#8217;t any ordinary <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousand&nbsp;dollar laptop</a> hardware specifications.&nbsp;These are the workstation grade CPU and GPU&nbsp;which are found on the laptops meant to fulfill&nbsp;the most intense computing requirements like <a title="The Best Laptops for CAD – Our Most Recommended Laptops for AutoCAD &amp; SOLIDWORKS" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-cad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAD or&nbsp;3D modeling</a> and certainly these specs are also best for 4K (and futuristic 8K)&nbsp;video editing.</p>
<p>The display of MSI GT63 Titan is the biggest let down as it comes with 15.6 inch display with just full HD resolution. However, it has a fast 144Hz refresh-rate and it&#8217;s an IPS panel so it is bright, color accurate and offers really good viewing angles. There&#8217;s also no shortage of the storage space here as this laptop houses a 256GB of SSD and a large 1TB of hard drive. The only room for improvement here would be cutting down on weight a bit and of course the PRICE. This futuristic laptop does not come cheap and costs about solid $2700.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, The MSI GT63 Titan is&nbsp;a highly advanced rig&nbsp;and is the perfect pick for editing pros looking for a VR ready high-end laptop&nbsp;to get set with their adept video editing&nbsp;skills.</p>

<h3>ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX531 Laptop <span class="su-label su-label-type-info">Lightest Laptop for Video Editing with GTX 1080</span></h3>
<p>The all-new <strong>ASUS ROG Zephyrus S</strong> is the most powerful and lightest laptop you can buy for video editing right now.</p>
<div id="attachment_5697" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://amzn.to/33FJafa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5697" class="wp-image-5697 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-S-GX531GW.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX531GW lightweight 15 inch laptop for video editing" width="550" height="472"></a><p id="caption-attachment-5697" class="wp-caption-text">ASUS ROG Zephyrus S – Thinnest &amp; Lightest Laptop for Video Editing</p></div>
<p>It has Intel Core i7-9750H processor paired with 16GB of RAM, and it provides 512GB of SSD for storage. The graphics on the laptop is backed by the powerful Nvidia GeForce <strong>RTX 2070</strong> dedicated GPU with 8GB DDR5 memory. All these ultra high-end hardware comes in the chassis which is just 0.6&#8243; thick and weighs only 5 pounds!</p>
<p>The only thing which is disappointing on this laptop is its 1080p display. With the hardware capable of firing up multiple 4K displays, the full HD display on this laptop doesn&#8217;t wholly utilize the hardware of this laptop.</p>
<p>But, you can always connect external 4K monitors for better video editing experience, and the hardware of this laptop can push up to three 4K monitors at once. So overall, if you&#8217;re looking for a lightweight machine that doesn&#8217;t compromise on the performance, and of-course if budget is not a problem for you, then ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX531 is the best video editing laptop for you.</p>
