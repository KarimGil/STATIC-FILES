<p>The Acer Aspire 5 is one of the most compact powerhouse laptops you can buy in $700 price range. It is a 15-inch laptop that packs in some extra-ordinary hardware inside, which makes it the best overall package. The laptop is powered by the latest <strong>Intel Core i7-8565U processor</strong> and graphics on the device is coordinated by a dedicated<strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU</strong> which reflects the clearer picture of the laptop, that it can be a powerful all-rounder machine.</p>
<p>Talking about the design, the Acer Aspire 5 sports an all-metal chassis with a striking black finish. The laptop weighs less than 4 pounds and has a very thin profile of 0.7&#8243; which is excellent considering its size. Most laptops packing powerful hardware inside such thin and light chassis has thermal problems, but that&#8217;s not a problem with Acer Aspire 5. The laptop remains at comfortable temperatures even while gaming, which is a huge plus for casual gamers. The laptop also has a backlit keyboard and responsive touchpad which supports gestures. Additionally, Acer’s TrueHarmony high-performance sound system is pumped in its two stereo speakers giving a decent surround sound experience.</p>

Still, it manages to pack inside powerful hardware to get you going with anything. It is powered by a latest Whiskey Lake (8th Gen) CPU from Intel and has 8GB of RAM.

It will be great option for anyone, but we think it&#8217;s perfect match for students and frequent travelers because of its lightweight chassis and long battery life of up to 14 hours!</p>
