Hi,

You can get any of these machines they all are capable for gaming. If you want me to pick one, then my pick is the MSI GV62 8RD 15-inch Gaming Laptop. For drawing you can get the graphics tablet which you can hook up to the laptop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi 
I love video games (especially indie ones) and I hope to become a game dev one day. Which of these laptops would be best for not only gaming, but game development? I also need a good laptop that I can draw with. Thank you!]]></description>

Hi Milad,
If you&#039;re looking for a gaming laptop, then I would say there are a lot of other laptops that are more powerful than this one and cost way less. I am pointing at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/#L9&quot;&gt;MSI GV62 8RD&lt;/a&gt; which is our top pick in the $800 price-range right now. It has i5-8300H which is way better for gaming than the i5-8250U on the ASUS VivoBook. Also, it comes with more powerful GTX 1050 Ti GPU. If you&#039;re planning to spend around $1000, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-predator-helios-300-review-ph315-51/&quot; title=&quot;Acer Predator Helios 300 Review (PH315-51-78NP) – Breaking Stereotypes of Budget Gaming Laptops&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acer Predator Helios 300&lt;/a&gt; is clearly the best pick. You get six-core Intel Core i7 processor, GTX 1060 GPU and an excellent 144Hz 15-inch display.]]></description>

Hi,
Make sure to buy the laptop with GTX 1050 Ti or higher as GTX 1050 doesn&#039;t support the VR and you&#039;ll find a lot of budget laptops in sub-$800 category that comes with GTX 1050. I would prefer the &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/#L5&quot;&gt;Dell Inspiron 7567&lt;/a&gt; because it has a slightly better display than Acer Nitro.]]></description>
