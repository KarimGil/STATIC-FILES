MacBook Air is enough for beginner-level editing work if you do it with patience. If you are looking for a Windows alternative to it, then Acer predator Helios 300 is excellent option. However, don&#039;t expect its battery to last for a long time. For around $700, there is HP Pavilion 15 and the MSI GV62 8RD gaming laptops. You will find them in our guide to buy the laptops under $700 &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/&quot; title=&quot;Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike, 

I&#039;m currently looking for a laptop around $700 for editing video and photo without any lag with a smooth rendering. What laptop would you recommend ? And, do you think that for a beginner MacBook Air is enough for editing video and photos?]]></description>

ASUS ROG Strix is indeed a great option but for about $100 more you can get the 2019 Acer Predator Helios 300 (PH315-52-78VL) which comes with the newest 9th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU which is a great value for $1200.]]></description>

Hi Ellie,

If you&#039;re starting with video editing and going to be serious about it, then I would recommend you to go with the HP Pavilion 15 laptop because it has better CPU and more powerful GPU. Of course, that added performance also makes it cost more than Acer Aspire E 15, but you&#039;ll appreciate its performance if you&#039;re planning to continue video editing for a long run. 
If you edit the videos occasionally, then get the Acer Aspire E 15. It is the best budget all-purpose laptop out there. It has adequately powerful CPU and GPU which output enough horsepowers to get you going through almost anything but a little bit slow sometimes than the HP Pavilion 15.]]></description>

Between the Acer Aspire E 15 and HP Pavilion 15 you have on this list, which would you recommend for basic video editing on a budget, and why would you go with one over the other?]]></description>
