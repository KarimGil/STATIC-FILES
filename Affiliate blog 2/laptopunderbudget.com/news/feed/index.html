										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, you must have learned about <a title="HP gives a boost to their Elite 800 notebooks with SureSense and advanced privacy features" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/hp-gives-boost-elite-800-notebooks-suresense-advanced-privacy-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP&#8217;s Elitebook upgrades</a> but that&#8217;s not all HP is up to. Their already top of the line business machines the ZBooks are now powered with even improved hardware and endowed with high build quality.</p>
<p>The new upgrades involve the 14U and 15U G6 workstations, named for their 14 and 15.6-inch screen sizes. But that is the only major difference between them. The insides are assembled with eighth-generation Intel CPU with tons of variants to choose from. Starting at the Core i5-8265U, and going all the way up to the i7-8665U. Storage options go from 128GB to 2TB of SSD while you can configure the machines with 32GB of DDR4 memory, an AMD WX 3200 graphics if you are in pursuit of 3D rendering.</p>
<p>Now all this might not be packed in the exterior that you imagine but trust me, do not let the skinny frame fool you. Their contemporary aluminium chassis can withstand much more than traditional &#8216;durable&#8217; machines. HP has managed to make these brawny enough to pass 19 MIL-STD tests so the professional users do not have to worry about travelling with them in unpleasant weather conditions. However, their gauntness did take a toll on the port selection. You will only find a USB 3.0 port, an RJ-45 Ethernet input, a Thunderbolt port, an HDMI and headphone jack in the selection. HP also sacrificed the U-Series Intel chips for H-series which might not be able to live up to the typical workstation laptop performance. But let&#8217;s hope that the Core-i7 processors and the extensive storage make up for the shortfall.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>An exciting upgrade is the 4K screen option, offering remarkable 400 nits of brightness. You can also take things up a notch with 1080p screen alternatives and a variety of other options including protective glass anti-glare coatings, and touch support. The 14U and 15U are packed with 50-watt-hour and 56-watt-hour batteries respectively, delivering up to 14 hours per charge. This might not seem as impressive to business professionals for a mobile workstation but the fast charging feature offers a ray of hope. And yes, HP has made sure to add Sure View in Zbooks as well to block out unwanted eyes and prying co-workers.</p>
<p>Weighing just a litter under 4 pounds, the Zbooks aren&#8217;t really breaking barriers in the &#8216;lightweight&#8217; area but specs like Wi-Fi 6, LTE advanced and Bluetooth kind of takes the attention away from its minor shortcomings.</p>
<p>HP is yet to disclose the price of these workstation ultrabooks but we&#8217;ll sure know it before May 27 which is when the devices will be available for purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has worked through and through on their Elite 800 series notebooks and have come up with not just refined functionalities but have equipped the new editions with over the charts hardware as well.</p>
<h3>Improved malware protection</h3>
<p>More specifically, HP&#8217;s clamshell designed EliteBook 830 G6, EliteBook 840 G6, EliteBook 850 G6 and the convertible EliteBook x360 830 G6 are getting an upgrade. Starting with the most notable one, the Sure Sense technology. If you are not familiar with the concept, Sure Sense is an advanced malware detection program that works alongside Windows Defender.</p>
<p>HP recognized Sure Sense as a cutting edge technology instead of just another anti-virus due to its light footprint on your machine. HP claims that running Sure Sense won&#8217;t choke your system&#8217;s arteries and would work seamlessly even without an active internet connection. These are alongside Sure Sense&#8217;s obvious characteristics: lightweight performance capabilities, ability to flag known and unknown ransomware and HP Sure Click. Sure Click will be the system&#8217;s defence mechanism which sandboxes browser tabs and allows you to browse untrusted websites and open suspicious attachments in a protected virtual environment.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new with the hardware</h3>
<p>HP has equipped the EliteBook 830 G6, HP EliteBook 840 G6, and HP EliteBook 850 G6, and the HP EliteBook x360 830 G6 with a privacy shutter to save you from prying eyes, a whopping 18 hour battery backup, and a 1,000-nit screen.</p>
<p>The Elitebook 830 G6 and EliteBook x360 830 G6 will come with a Core i3-8145U additional option while Core i5-8265U and Core i7-8565 Whiskey Lake processor options are common for all four editions in this lineup. The options of memory go up to 32GB for RAM and up to 512GB for SSD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_5513" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5513" class="size-full wp-image-5513" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HP-Elitebook-800-Series-Notebooks.jpg" alt="HP Elitebook 800 Series Notebooks" width="1217" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5513" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit &#8211; HP</em></p></div>
<p>The editions vary in screen sizes as well. The EliteBook 830 G6 and x360 830 G6 will come with 13.3-inch displays. Whereas the 840 G6 rocks a 14-inch panel and the 850 G6 is a 15-inch laptop. You can also get additional custom specs with the 14-inch EliteBook 840 G6 and 15.6-inch EliteBook 850 G6 and add a Radeon RX 550 GPU. So there are a lot of options to go about here.</p>
<p>The EliteBook G6 however, has been specially blessed by HP with an embedded touch sensor and an in-built webcam cover. However, the EliteBook x360 830 will star an anti-glare, glossy or Sure View touchscreen display.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s left</h4>
<p>Elitebooks in 2019, will have full support for 4G LTE data connectivity, the latest Wi-Fi 6 standards, Bluetooth 5 and HP&#8217;s Extended Range Wireless LAN technology. One thing we know here for certain is that the Elitebooks will leave no room for a patchy, disruptive browsing experience and will ensure reliable connectivity to other peripherals as well.</p>
<p>While little is known about the pricing of Elitebooks, but we can most certainly be sure that they won&#8217;t be cheap. The Elitebooks will start hitting the shelves in May with only x360 830 G6 to be available in June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all-new Acer ConceptD laptops are what happens when Acer takes all of their expertise in creating gaming laptops and turns them into something designed specifically for video editors, illustrators, and creators, as well as to take on Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Apple has had a fairly sizable share of the creator market for years with their MacBook and MacBook Pro. However, it&#8217;s also no secret that more and more creators are starting to look towards cheaper, Windows alternatives. The market is already starting to respond, but there just aren&#8217;t that many alternatives yet. Consider the Acer ConceptD laptops as the latest and one of the best in the growing line of reasons why creators should switch over to Windows and eschew Apple starting today.</p>
<p>Acer announced their new brand, ConceptD, earlier on April 11, Thursday, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Acer ConceptD laptops will initially come in three variants, each designed to help position the company to give creators a viable Windows alternative to the MacBook Pro at various price points.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Acer ConceptD Laptops</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5481 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-ConceptD-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Acer ConceptD Laptops" width="1200" height="792" />The ConceptD 9 is the flagship of Acer&#8217;s latest line. Acer claims that they designed it specifically for drawing and 3D work. To this end, they equipped the Concept D 9 with a convertible 17-inch 4K display. Not only that, but the display is also Pantone validated and has a near-perfect &lt;1 Delta-E accuracy rating for maximum color accuracy. The display also uses the same Ezel Aero Hinge as that of the Predator Triton 900 and comes with built-in support for Wacom pen.</p>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0N4Y1-G1zU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Under the hood, the ConceptD 9 comes equipped with a latest ninth-generation Intel Core i9 CPU, an RTX 2080 GPU, as well as support for up 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage space. For modern accessibility, Acer equipped the ConceptD 9 with Thunderbolt 3, USB Type-C and DisplayPort 1.4 ports.</p>
<p>The ConceptD 9&#8217;s smaller brother, the ConceptD 7, is a bit smaller. It sports a 15.6-inch 4K display and &#8220;only&#8221; comes with up to a Core i7 processor. You can also choose to have it with an RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU or the RTX 2060. The ConceptD 7 also doesn&#8217;t have the same convertible screen as the flagship of the line, nor the same pen support. However, it does come with the same storage and RAM options, making it a more traditional and more affordable laptop alternative.</p>
<p>Finally, the ConceptD 5 is the least powerful of the three. It still has the same 15.6-inch 4K panel as that of the ConceptD 7. However, underneath, it&#8217;s a bit slower, albeit still capable, with 8th-Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors powering it, along with the AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPU. Both RAM, as well as storage options, are also limited for the ConceptD5 compared to the ConceptD 7 and Concept D9. But, if it&#8217;s any consolation, the Concept D5 is the smallest and lightest of all the Acer ConceptD laptops.</p>
<h3>When Are the Acer ConceptD Laptops Going to Release?</h3>
<p>The Acer ConceptD 5 and ConceptD 7 will start selling as early as later this month of April. The former will start selling at a $1,699 price point, while the latter will set users back at least $2,299. The more powerful Acer ConceptD 9 is not set to launch until later on in June. The flagship product of the new line will start selling at a $4,999 price point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer gaming laptops, specifically, the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7, will both receive hardware and design updates once their latest versions release later this year.</p>
<p>This was confirmed on Thursday, April 11, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Nitro series line of gaming laptops are part of Acer&#8217;s effort to tap into the more budget-conscious side of the gaming laptop market. As per Acer General Manager of Notebooks, James Lin, the Nitro series Acer gaming laptops are proof that &#8220;performance gaming doesn&#8217;t need to break the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>True to that, the Acer Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 come at very affordable price points. However, they have an interesting set of features, both in terms of design and hardware. Even though there are slight compromises, the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 present themselves as budget-friendly alternatives with commendable specifications.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New in the 2019 Acer Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 Gaming Laptops?</h3>
<p>Of the two Acer gaming laptops, the Nitro 7 is more noteworthy.  It is actually a new product, not a revamp. It features a metal chassis, which belies its &#8220;affordable&#8221; nature and measures just 19.9mm thin. More importantly, it also comes equipped with a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a refresh rate of 144Hz and a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Nitro 7 is aimed for hardcore gamers on the go. Specifically, it&#8217;s made for those who love playing FPS titles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Nitro 5 is the one that&#8217;s actually a refresh of the older line. It is also the cheaper of the two Acer gaming laptops. It comes with two types of displays. You can either choose a 15.6-inch display or a 17.3-inch display. Regardless, both will come with an increased screen-to-body ratio of 80 percent. This means that the display bezels of the new Nitro 5 (as well as that of the Nitro 7) are a lot narrower compared to the older versions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5468 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" />Outside of the fact that both Acer gaming laptops come available with up to 9th-generation Intel Core processors and the latest Nvidia graphics cards, other important features include expansive storage options, including a dedicated HDD slot and two M.2 SSD slots, as well as support for up to 32GB DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>Both the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 will also come with the &#8220;CoolBoost&#8221; feature, a dual-fan cooling design that allows the laptops to keep temperatures low during intense gaming sessions. Both also feature a Killer Ethernet E2500 networking card. Additionally, you can also use the Network Optimizer Tool by Acer to further minimize latency issues when gaming online.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to the Acer Predator Helios 700</h3>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgWq9jsmNiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The creme of the crop when it comes to Acer gaming laptops, the latest Acer Predator Helios 700 puts the Taiwan-based manufacturer right at the forefront of risque innovations in the high-end, desktop-replacement, gaming laptop niche.</p>
<p>As expected, the top of the line Acer Predator Helios 700 will feature high-end hardware components. This includes an overclockable 9th-gen Intel Core i9 CPU, as well as the regular Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU and not the toned down Max-Q version, as well as support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, however.</p>
<p>The Acer Predator Helios 700 also features a transforming keyboard and trackpad that you can slide forward to help improve ventilation, which can come in quite handy if you&#8217;re trying to squeeze even more performance out of the Acer Predator Helios 700 by overclocking its hardware. The said keyboard also comes packed with MagForce keys, as well as linear switches, in addition to the requisite RGB lighting. This helps create an optimal typing and gaming experience.</p>
<p>For those who think that the Acer Predator Helios 700 is a bit too much, the smaller Acer Predator Helios 300 is also available. The latest version retains the look of its predecessor, but it comes with improved internals.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;#1 gaming notebook&#8221; comes equipped with a 144Hz display that has a 3ms response time. It can come up with up to an RTX 2080 GPU, a 9th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, as well as 32GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who is familiar with HP&#8217;s laptop categories would know that their Envy series is the most reasonable and accessible one. Considering that it sits right between their premium Spectre laptops and their lower end Pavilion series. But those were facts till 2018.</p>
<p>HP has recently worked on their Envy series to meet the standards of Spectre laptops and has introduced features like upgraded processors, a webcam privacy switch (that cuts off the power to the camera), fingerprint reader, wake-on voice, Sure View and built-in support for Alexa for some as well. There are noticeable hardware upgrades as will like slimmer bezels and reduced weightage.</p>
<p>But that is not even the best part. Even with these premium specs, HP has still managed to keep their price range below $1000 which is considered to be the minimum price benchmark of premium laptops.</p>
<h2>HP Envy 13 and HP Envy 17 &#8211; the non-convertibles</h2>
<p>Featuring Intel Core 8th-generation<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/07/intel-announces-six-new-ninth-generation-core-processors/"> </a>processors the HP Envy 13 and Envy 17 with no reversible hinges are traditional laptops receiving the 2019 upgrades.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5414" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-13.jpg" alt="New HP Envy 13 " width="418" height="355" />The HP Envy 13 has been revamped to shed a few pounds and inches too. Remodeled to be 0.2 mm thinner and 0.03 pounds lighter than its 2018 counterpart. HP has also blessed this one with a Left hinge that extends the bottom of its lid to bump up the keyboard for easy typing. What I like best about this remodeling is that we won&#8217;t be suffering from the loss of USB Type A ports due to the slim body. HP has come up with a &#8216;drop jaw&#8217; design that let you connect USB supported devices by simply pulling down a flap. The complete set of ports include USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, two  USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a headset jack, and a microSD card reader.</p>
<p>For the Envy 13, HP claims that its 53 Wh battery is capable of providing 16 hours of backup which sounds a little on the &#8216;too good to be true&#8217; area. The processors can go up to Intel Core i7-8565U, an 8GB DDR4-2400 memory (onboarded and not upgradeable) and a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5415" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-17.jpg" alt="HP Envy 17 2019" width="442" height="376" />The Envy 17 might interest some gamers due to its NVIDIA&#8217;s GeForce MX250 graphics on board. As there is more room on this one, HP has loaded the Envy 17 with 12GB of RAM, 32GB of Intel Optane memory, and a 512GB PCie NVMe solid state drive. Also blessed with thinner bezels, the Envy 17 is estimated to be 45% slimmer than its 2018 version.</span></p>
<p>The display on both these models comes with a 1980 x 1080 touch screen alongside a backlit keyboard and stereo B&amp;O speakers. Color variety of these includes Pale Gold, Natural Silver, and Nightfall Black shades. Both are expected to be available by April starting from $899.</p>
<h2 style="font-style: normal; line-height: 41.6px;">HP Envy x360 13 and Envy x360 15 &#8211; the convertibles</h2>
<p>The Envy x360 15 and Envy x360 15 are the classic convertibles which can be molded into a tablet or into tent mode by the rotating hinge. While the HP Envy 13 and Envy 17 might pique the interest of students and gamers, these two are most likely suitable for arts and graphics enthusiasts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5416" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-x360-13.jpg" alt="HP Envy x360 13 2019" width="394" height="259" />The Envy x360 13 will be using an AMD&#8217;s 2nd-gen Ryzen processor, can deliver up to 14.5 hours of battery backup, includes up to 1TB of SSD storage and up to 16GB of RAM. The ports selection will boast two USB 3.1 Type-A ports along with a USB-C input and a headphone jack. This one is just 0.6 inches thick and weighs only 2.9 pounds. That is the most we know about the Envy x360 13.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5417" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-x360-15.jpg" alt="HP Envy x360 - 2019" width="438" height="232" />Now the x360 15 is a whole other story. It comes with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors and AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 5 or 7 processors so there are plenty of options to go about here. There is 8GB of RAM and the most basic configuration has a 256GB SSD while the higher-end model is boosted with 512GB of storage. The screen res remains the same throughout each config that is a 1980 x 1080 15.6 inch touchscreen with tiny bezels. There are a lot of other amenities too like quad speakers tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen, and a backlit keyboard with a num keypad. Battery backup is claimed to be 13 hours approx depending upon the usage. The notebook measures 14.1 inches to 9.7 inches and 0.7 inches &#8211; weighing just about 4.5 pounds. The ports selection includes a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, an HDMI port, and a headset jack and an SD card reader.</p>
<p>The price for the Envy x360 13 starts from $700 and for the x360 15 HP will sell AMD Ryzen-powered models for $800 and up. Choices of processors include Ryzen 5 2500U or Ryzen 7 3700U processors with Radeon Vega integrated graphics. For Intel models, it will cost you $800. Both models are expected to be released by April.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has announced its refreshed lineup of convertible laptops series Pavilion x360. In an announcement made earlier today, Hewlett Packard has introduced three new laptops in three different screen sizes &#8211; 11.6-inches, 14-inches, and 15.6-inches. The OEM&#8217;s Pavilion x360 series consisting of 2-in-1 laptops are known for featuring a touch screen, seamless design, and powerful performance. With its refreshed lineup, HP has tried to entice users with budget constraints who are looking forward to purchase a laptop that doubles up as a tablet.</p>
<p>Here are the new Pavilion x360 convertible laptops along with their specifications.</p>
<h3>1. HP Pavilion x360  11 &#8211; A 11.6-inch fanless convertible laptop</h3>
<p>Out of the three newly announced convertible laptops, HP Pavilion x360 11 is the cheapest and only model to feature a fanless design. It is a sleek and lightweight 2-in-1 laptop having an 11.6-inches display weighing just 2.7 pounds. The laptop is powered by an Intel Pentium Silver N5000 quad-core Gemini Lake processor which is pretty decent for an entry-level laptop. It features 4GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage. HP Pavilion x360 11 is supported by a 37.69 Wh battery and is accompanied with a 45-watt power adapter. HP has said that the 11-inch notebook will offer up to 10:45 hours of battery life.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5396" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1122-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 11 - 2019" width="581" height="386" /></p>
<p>Additionally, for connectivity,  the laptop has  802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 (5Gb/s) port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports, a headset jack, and a microSD card reader. The HP Pavilion x360 11 starts at $400 and will be available from May onwards.</p>
<h3>2. HP Pavilion x360 14 &#8211; A 14-inch convertible laptop supporting 8th Gen i7 Processors</h3>
<p>Next in the refreshed x360 lineup is a 14-inch convertible PC which is aimed at power users. HP Pavilion x360 14 features an exciting design with a 3-sided micro edge display that makes bezels thinner. On the design front, HP boasts that it has provided a new hourglass edge to make it easier for users to open the laptop easily from all three sides. However, at 0.8-inches thick and weighing 4.3 pounds, it is not as stylish and portable as the 11-inch x360.</p>
<p>Unlike its 11-inch sibling, it is configurable and supports up to 8th generation Intel Core i7 processors. Carrying an HD display having 1366 X 768 resolution or optional 1080p display, the base variant of x360 14 comes with an Intel Core i3-8145U processor, Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM and internal storage of 128GB. The laptop supports up to 1TB HDD and up to 512GB PCIe SSD.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5397" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1422-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 14 - 2019" width="696" height="536" /></p>
<p>For more power, it also supports up to Intel Core i7- 8565U processor, 16GB of RAM and NVIDIA Geforce MX130 or newest MX250 graphics card. HP has provided 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a USB Type-C Generation 1 port, an HDMI 1.4 port, a 3.5mm audio jack, an SD card reader and two USB 3.1 Type &#8211; A Gen 1 ports. A fingerprint reader is also available for users as an extra option for authentication. The company has said that x360 14 will provide the battery life of up to 11 hours.</p>
<p>HP Pavilion x360 14 starts at $500 and will be available in the market from April onwards.</p>
<h3>3. HP Pavilion x360 15 &#8211; a 15-inch convertible laptop supporting AMD Radeon 535 graphics card</h3>
<p>For large screen seekers, HP has announced its x360 15 that sports a 15.6-inch display with 1366&#215;768  or 1920&#215;1080 resolution. It shares its design with its 14-inch sibling and features the same hourglass edge and 3-sided micro-edge display for design with thinner bezels. Measuring 14.1″ x 8.4″ x 0.8″, this model weighs 4.3 pounds which is, again, not lightweight exactly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5398" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Pavilion-x360-1522-2019.jpg" alt="HP Pavilion x360 15 - 2019" width="723" height="495" /></p>
<p>On the performance front, HP Pavilion x360 15 also supports 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with up to 16GB of RAM and a couple of storage options. This model also supports AMD Radeon 535 graphics card and can be used for purposes like video editing, animation and much more. You can configure x360 15 with up to 2TB HDD and up to 512GB PCIe SSD. HP has provided a multi-format card reader, a USB Type-C port, an HDMI port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports and a 3.5mm port for audio accessories.</p>
<p>The Pavilion x360 15 has its downside in the form of the same 41 Wh battery which means that we cannot expect a long battery life from it.</p>
<p>HP Pavilion x360 15 starts at $800 and will be available from  April this year.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">All the three new Pavilion convertibles will be available in different color options &#8211; Cloud Blue, Pale Gold, and HP&#8217;s standard Natural Silver color. Also, HP convertibles are fitted with dual speakers and HP audio boost with Audio by B&amp;O.</span></p>
<p>In addition to convertible laptops, HP has also announced two new monitors including one with 27f 4K Display and another featuring 34f Curved Display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are well aware of Acer&#8217;s TravelMate X3410&#8217;s popularity. Lauded largely for its affordable price, portability and its compatibility with business users. Now just after a couple of months, Acer has come up with its upgraded model &#8211; the Acer TravelMate X514-51. The company has been referring the latest release as their &#8220;lightest and thinnest professional notebook&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>Acer is rooting for this laptop to appeal to travelers and, business professionals. The category of users who are always on their feet, hence their emphasis on it being the lightest and thinnest notebook.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>
<p>Well, technically the TravelMate X514-51 comes with the same thickness as the TravelMate X3410 but is &#8216;lighter&#8217; in a sense that it weighs just 2.1 pounds vs. the 3.7 pounds X3410. The chopped of pounds ultimately means losing a few key features as well, which in this case is the full-sized SD reader and legacy VGA port.</p>
<p>The TravelMate X514-51 boasts a magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminum alloy chassis which makes it possible for durability and portability to coexist. However, do not be fooled by its spindly body as even with a small form factor, Acer has managed to pack it with a fair amount of power.</p>
<p>Inside this Windows 10 laptop, you will find up to 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processors, up to 512GB of SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM with a 14-inch FHD 1080p touch display. There is also a backlit keyboard, a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello alongside a 720p webcam. Acer claims that apart from the TravelMate being light on the body and hefty on the specs, the laptop can give up to 10 hours of battery backup. Of course, it sounds highly unlikely, but we can&#8217;t be certain until we actually review the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_5393" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-image-5393 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Acer-TravelMate-X5-2019.jpg" alt="Acer TravelMate X5 - 2019" width="857" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer TravelMate X5</strong> | Image &#8211; Acer</em></p></div>
<p>What we felt they left out of the equation was any mention of Nvidia or AMD GPU options and port selection. Some of the things the manufacturer let go of while building the small form factor of the machine we suspect. However, we do see a USB Type-A port in the pictures of the laptop which I assume is essential in business laptops.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>A little pricier than the TravelMate X3410, the TravelMate X514-51 will be rolled out in June, starting at $1,099.99. This price will buy you a Core i5, 8GB DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can always bump it up with a Core i7, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM, and up to a 512GB SSD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where most manufacturers use the Mobile World Congress as a platform to announce their latest mobile gadgets, Lenovo used MWC 2019 to announce their latest line of refreshed ThinkPad T Series and X series laptop, set to release in June later this year.</p>
<p>Easily the most well-known and popular of their ThinkPad line of laptops, the latest refreshes all share one trait in common — all of them will be equipped with the latest Intel Whiskey Lake processors.</p>
<h2>Say Hello to the Refreshed ThinkPad T Series Laptops</h2>
<p>The headliner of the latest refreshed T Series laptops is the Lenovo ThinkPad T490s.</p>
<p>Released as the successor to the widely popular Lenovo Thinkpad T480s, the T490s sports a thinner chassis at 0.63-inches over the T480s&#8217; 0.72-inch chassis. Also, it can come equipped with up to a super bright 500-nit HDR screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. An option to have slightly less brighter 400-nit, 1920 x 1080 display is also available for those who are willing to sacrifice aesthetics for a longer battery life. Both versions of the T490s&#8217; 14-inch screen will come with a PrivacyGuard panel to help hide the content of your screen from prying eyes.</p>
<p>Specs-wise, the T490s can come with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD, 32GB of DDR4 ram, and a battery expected to last up to 20 hours unplugged.</p>
<div id="attachment_5331" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-image-5331 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Refreshed-T400-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Refreshed T400 Laptops" width="1200" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-caption-text"><i>Image &#8211; Lenovo</i></p></div>
<p>Next up is the entry-level ThinkPad T490, the follow-up to the ThinkPad T480. It has a much-thinner bezel compared to its predecessor and comes with the same set of privacy features as the T490s, as well as an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card upgrade and the same 500-nit, 2560 x 1440 resolution HDR display.</p>
<p>Finally, their bulkiest and biggest of them all, the T590 will use the additional real estate to over a high-res 4K display, complete with 500 nits of brightness and Dolby Vision color.</p>
<p>Similar to the T490, the T590 can come equipped with an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card. It will also feature the new single-battery RapidCharge technology by Lenovo and will be nearly half a pound lighter compared to the 4.29-pound ThinkPad T580 at just 3.87 pounds.</p>
<h2>Expected Released Date of the Refreshed ThinkPad Laptops</h2>
<p>All three of the refreshed T Series laptops will arrive sometime in June in the United States. However, those in Europe can have their hands on the T490 and the T590 as early as this March; the T490s will arrive in Europe in April.</p>
<p>As for the pricing, the T490 is the cheapest of the bunch with a starting price point of $999. The T590 is next at $1,029, followed by the T490s at $1,279.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the midst of MWC 2019, Lenovo is taking huge leaps for upgrading their ThinkPad lineup. The laptop giant Lenovo, announced their latest additions &#8211; the X390, and X390 Yoga to the ThinkPad portfolio.</p>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390</h3>
<p>Lenovo has bumped up the display from 12 to a 13-inch, but the best part is that the overall form factor of the device has not been compromised. As expected in 2019, Lenovo has introduced 50% slimmer bezels which has resulted in an even slimmer machine than before, rounding to 0.6 inches thin and weighing just 2.7 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5322" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Launched-at-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Launched at MWC 2019" width="700" height="517" /></p>
<p>Inside, there is an 8th Gen Intel Core vPro i7 processor, up to 32GB of RAM, and storage goes up to 1TB. The ports selection on the ThinkPad X390 includes a Thunderbolt 3, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1, an HDMI input slot, a microSD card slot, alongside a Kensington lock, and a single jack for mic and headset connectivity. Lenovo has also promised for the laptop to deliver up to 17 hours of power backup and also introduced some nifty security features. Like the PrivacyGuard that utilizes the built-in IR camera to detect snoopers behind you- enabling alerts and using the ThinkShutter to tone down the brightness for prying eyes only.</p>
<p>The screen options on the ThinkPad X390 include a basic 13.3-inch, 1080p touch display with 300 nits of brightness and a 13.3-inch, 1080p PrivacyGuard non-touch alternative with 400 nits brightness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Top Picks of Laptops For Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga</h3>
<p>Now, Lenovo&#8217;s Yoga series has been a portable marvel for all travelers and on-the-run kind of consumers. Its refreshing to see that alongside the X390, the X390 Yoga is also getting a boost. Toning down an already slim screen, the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 will be 2 percent thinner to 9.6 inches and 5 percent lighter to just 2.9 lbs from its previous version.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5323" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Yoga-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga - MWC 2019" width="815" height="500" /></p>
<p>The only display option on the Yoga X390 is a 13.3 inch display, 1080p IPS touch screen and 300 nits of brightness. Such neat specs really doesn&#8217;t let you miss the lack of variety in it.</p>
<p>With the same processing capacity and storage as its sibling, the Yoga X390 can only be bumped up to 16 GB of RAM. The battery life is also toned down and can go up to just 14.5 hours. With an integrated HD Graphics 620 GPU, the ports gallery on this one remains the same as the ThinkPad X390. What&#8217;s unique in this one is the <strong>LTE connectivity</strong> (with the Wi-Fi 6 protocol that has been configured into both models) and a stylus pen that seems like an essential for all portables. But the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 does lack the PrivacyGuard feature without losing the HD camera and the ThinkShutter cover.</p>
<p>However, both sibling share the dual far-field noise-canceling microphones, delivering top-notch voice output during conferencing and while using smart assistants.</p>
<p>Both laptops are expected to hit the shelves in May. The ThinkPad X390 is starting from $1,099, and the Yoga variant from $1,359.</p>
