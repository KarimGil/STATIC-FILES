The laptops which I suggested have new 8th Gen CPUs. They have low base clock frequency but when required they can turbo boost to provide that extra punch. The i5-8250U on the Acer laptops that I have suggested above has base clock frequency of 1.6 GHz however when required it can boost itself up to whopping 3.4 GHz. And, not to forget they are &#039;quad-core&#039; processors. So, they are lot more powerful than we actually think it is.

You might think that why these processors have low base clock frequency? Well, that&#039;s for the better battery backup. While surfing web or editing docs you don&#039;t need much power so CPU provides the required power by running at lower speeds and saves power. And, when you play games or do anything that requires more CPU power, it turbo boosts and provides required power (of-course that compromises battery life).

I hope this answers all your doubts.

Thanks.]]></description>

No offense I know I have less experience but why do you always suggest the laptops with low GHz?]]></description>

Thanks!
However, I&#039;m looking for a lightweight laptop because I need to travel with it a lot. Do you have any other suggestions?]]></description>

Hi,
I would recommend you to buy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/#L2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acer Aspire E 15 laptop&lt;/a&gt; for yourself. It comes with newest specs that are capable enough to handle programming and its battery life is also very good. It lasted for 7 and a half hours in our tests so it will be good for college.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,
I am looking for an affordable laptop for my college using. As I study Analytics, I have to use programs such as Python, R or Java. Can you recommend a laptop under $700 that meets my requirements?
Thanks a lot!]]></description>

Hi,
The Acer Aspire E15 is a very good laptop for light gaming and 3D graphics rendering works but if you can spend up to $730 then I would recommend you to buy the Acer Swift 3 laptop. It has quad-core Intel Core i5-8250U 8th Gen processor which is far more faster than the i7-7500U on Aspire E15. It also has dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU and has 8GB of RAM. Its hardware is upgradable and it weighs just 3.8 pounds! Best thing - Acer Swift 3 is on discount at Amazon right now. &#124; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2iyl8O2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Best Price on Amazon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Check out its current price on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
