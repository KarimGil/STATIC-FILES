Although its chassis is made up of full plastic, it is durable and resistant towards the daily wears and tears.</p>
<p>The display on this laptop is one of the best you can get in 300 dollars price range laptops (actually <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 price-range</a>).

It has a quad-core Intel Pentium N5000 processor inside paired with the 4GB of RAM.</p>

For storage, this laptop provides just 64GB of eMMC storage which is very low&nbsp;and might be deal breaking for&nbsp;some users, but considering the price of this laptop, its&nbsp;specs are justifiable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when you had to spend a hell lot of money to buy a good laptop because now many laptop manufacturers are offering decent performing laptops for the price lesser than $200! They are best for basic everyday tasks, but still, there are many tasks which these cheap laptops can&#8217;t perform. So which are the best laptops under $200? Are the laptops under 200 dollars really worth buying? Let&#8217;s find it out.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span></p>
<p><em>Of course, while buying the budget laptop, you have to keep your expectations in check, but when the budget is $200, you really have to take that seriously!</em></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t expect to play the newest games or perform demanding tasks such as video editing on these budget laptops, because the Windows Netbooks and Chromebooks that you would usually find in this price range are simply not made for it. They run on the lightweight operating systems such as Windows 10 S and Chrome OS and are powered by an entry-level CPUs paired with very less amount of RAM and storage which although can&#8217;t handle demanding workloads, they are perfect for everyday productivity tasks such as surfing the web, editing documents, managing small excel sheets and creating presentations. They also come in a very small and lightweight form factor, and as its less powerful hardware consumes very less power, most of them have good battery life as well.</p>
<p>So, they can be a great option for frequent travelers, students, or anyone who wants an inexpensive laptop for answering emails, editing documents, and other such basic tasks. However, for anything more than that, the sub-$200 laptops will be way underpowered. If you were expecting more from these budget notebooks, then we strongly recommend you to increase your budget and check out other <a title="More Budget Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/budget-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget laptop buying guides</a> on our website which includes more capable laptops that cost just slightly more than $200.</p>
<p>Well, if you think that these budget laptops are what you have been looking for, then as I said earlier, while searching for the best cheap laptops in the market, you will see there are mostly Windows laptops and Chromebooks available to buy under $200 budget. So, the first thing which you have to decide is whether you should buy a Windows laptop or a Chromebook?</p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">Windows Laptop or Chromebook: What should you buy under $200?</h4>
<hr>
<p>To buy the best and reliable laptop within your limited budget, you have to decide whether Windows laptops&nbsp;are best for your daily needs or Chromebooks. Below are a few comparisons&nbsp;which shall&nbsp;give you a proper idea of what is Chromebook and how it is different from Windows laptop that you&#8217;re probably used to.&nbsp;Go through it and then take your decision for&nbsp;buying the best cheap laptop under 200 dollars for yourself.</p>
<p>If you already know what you&#8217;re looking for then feel free to skip this and begin with the list of our top laptop picks below.</p>
<ul>
<li>As we all know Windows is the most used operating system on computers so getting used to a new windows laptop will be no problem for most of us. Whereas, Chrome OS, on the other hand, is still found on very limited laptops. While getting used to it won&#8217;t be much problem, as its UI is almost similar to using Chrome on Windows laptop but for those who don&#8217;t use Chrome, it can be a bit of work.</li>
<li>There are no software compatibility problems on Windows laptops. You can download apps and games from Microsoft Store and even install software from other third-party sources. On the other hand, Chromebooks are still limited to apps in the Chrome web store. Google added the Android Play Store support to the Chrome OS and many older Chromebooks did get the software update for that, but it is still available on the <a title="List of Chromebooks Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">selected models</a> only. Moreover, the apps on Play Store aren&#8217;t fully optimized for the Chromebooks, so if you are planning to use the android apps on your Chromebook, then make sure to get the touch-enabled one.</li>
<li>If you are looking for a cheap laptop to work on the MS Office, then definitely Windows laptop is the only option, as Chrome OS doesn&#8217;t support it yet. However, if you rely on Google&#8217;s suite of applications heavily and have to work online mostly, then nothing can beat Chromebooks at that. Chromebooks are also fast and battery efficient than Windows laptops as Chrome OS is a very lightweight cloud-based operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more differences between them, but these are the major ones.&nbsp;You can check out this guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3280998/laptop-computers/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebooks vs Windows Laptops</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;more in-depth&nbsp;idea about it.&nbsp;Keep your needs in mind and then decide whether you should buy a Chromebook under $200 or Windows laptop under $200.</p>
</div>

<p>So, now as you have decided what type of laptop you want to&nbsp;buy for yourself,&nbsp;we can proceed with the list of best laptops to buy under your budget of 200 dollars.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Note -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px">All budget laptops under $200 come with a very little amount of internal storage (64GB at most) so to buy a laptop with more storage (500GB or 1TB HDD), we recommend you to increase your budget a bit and have a look at <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our guide to buy the best laptop under $300</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laptops under $100? Do they really exist?&nbsp;The answer is YES! There are few laptop manufacturers who are offering laptops for the price as low as 100 dollars. But, finding a best cheap laptop isn&#8217;t an easy task as there are very&nbsp;few &#8220;box packed new laptops&#8221; available in this price range so buying a refurbished laptop is the only way to crack a deal here.

<p>Technology is improving every day and to cope up with all the latest technologies in the market, laptop manufacturers launch new laptop models with minor improvements to its predecessor laptops. As a result, the older laptops which are still great performers get huge price cuts when newer laptops are launched in the market. And, this is what makes buying older laptops still worthy. Well if we talk about <strong>buying the laptops under $100 budget</strong> specifically then you will hardly find any new laptops in this price range because one hundred&nbsp;dollars isn&#8217;t enough to buy a device like a laptop. But still, there&nbsp;are few refurbished laptops to buy under $100 which will&nbsp;let you do&nbsp;basic works like editing documents, making presentations, surfing the internet and other low performance requiring&nbsp;works. Yes, we will have a look at the list of best cheap laptops in a while&nbsp;but before that&#8230;</p>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want a MacBook for under $100? Well, you might not be able to buy the latest MacBook with this budget, but a refurbished 2013 MacBook, you surely can.</p>
<p>Being such an old machine, it is still one of the best-looking laptops you can buy for under $100. Its body is finished in white color, and its lid has Apple logo that lights up when you start the computer. As far as performance of the laptop is concerned, you can use this laptop for all sorts of productivity works, but playing games won&#8217;t be a good experience on this laptop because of its old hardware.</p>
<p>Even it runs a very old version of macOS which might limit you from using some modern apps on this MacBook. But overall, this MacBook is a great deal if you&#8217;re looking for a cheap productivity machine under $100.</p>

<p>As you can see in the specs, the Acer Aspire 1 is powered by the Intel Celeron N4000 dual-core processor, which is based on Gemini Lake. The CPU has a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz and can boost to 2.6 GHz. The chip also comes with 4 MB of L2 cache. This is the same CPU that you get in the HP Stream 14. Other than that, you get 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>With that said, let&#8217;s begin with our review of Acer Aspire 1, talking about each aspect of the laptop, one by one.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 is an entry-level laptop from Acer, so there isn&#8217;t really anything fancy about the design but it is still a robust machine, and overall it is very clean. The exterior of the laptop looks stylish, especially the brushed aluminum finish on the lid with silver Acer logo in the center. On opening the lid, you&#8217;ll find the same finish around the keyboard and touchpad area as well. While there is nothing to brag about the design of this laptop, it manages not to look cheap.</p>
<div id="attachment_4885" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-image-4885 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Textured-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Textured Lid" width="700" height="525" /><p id="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Brushed Aluminum Finish on the Lid</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, there are certain design flaws on this laptop, and one of them is its bad speaker placement. The laptop has two speakers at the bottom, one on either side, and its poor placement muffled the sound everytime I used the laptop from my lap. If we talk about the sound quality, then it isn&#8217;t that great either. Its two speakers do get loud enough to fill the small-sized room, but I felt a lack of clarity while listening to music. But, considering that this is a $200 laptop, some sacrifice needed to be made, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Talking about the internal design, getting to the internals of this laptop was very hard. I had to open fifteen screws and had to pull the back panel off to gain access to the parts, but that&#8217;s fine because there are no upgradable parts inside the laptop. The RAM and storage drive is soldered on the motherboard, and that makes users stuck with its low 4GB of RAM which kind of bottlenecks its overall performance (more on this later). Moreover, the internal design is fanless so you won&#8217;t be hearing any fan noise when you use the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_4886" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-image-4886 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Internal-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Internal Design" width="667" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Internal Design | RAM Soldered on Motherboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall the Acer Aspire 1 has decent build quality. The materials used do not feel like this is an entry-level device. The texture on the lid adds to the premiums of the laptop, and the laptop not only looks impressive but feels great as well. The device is pretty light, and you can easily take it with you.</p>

<h4>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h4>
<p>There are a couple of useful ports on this laptop that make it great for the price. You get an ethernet port that will allow you to plug in an ethernet cable if you want faster internet speeds and do not want to rely on a wireless connection. You also have an HDMI output port that will deliver 4K at 30 FPS. On the left, you have a USB 3.0 port to transfer data faster. You also get an SD card slot, but the card sticks out which can be an issue if you were looking to expand laptop&#8217;s limited storage with the SD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4887" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Left-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Left Side Ports" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you have the combo jack for headphones and two more USB 2.0 ports. These are slower ports that can be used to connect a mouse or other devices that do not require higher throughput.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Right-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="382" /></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you will be able to take advantage of high-speed internet and routers that use 5 GHz frequencies. The laptop also offers Bluetooth 4.1 which can be used to connect wireless devices like a mouse or a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display on the Aspire 1 is a 14-inch TN panel which does not offer great viewing angles, and as expected it isn&#8217;t color accurate either. The bright side is that while the screen is the same size as the HP Stream 14, it has a higher resolution. That said, the Acer Aspire 1 is the only laptop in this price segment to offer full HD display making it the perfect budget option for binge watchers.</p>
<div id="attachment_4890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-image-4890 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 - Display Review" width="800" height="637" /><p id="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>14-inch Full HD Matte Display</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The screen is a bit dim, but it has a matte coating on top which does a great job of reducing reflections while using this laptop in well-lit areas. Overall, it is a pretty decent panel keeping in mind that this laptop costs just a little <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200</a>.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature is that the screen can be rotated more than 180 degrees. The Acer Aspire 1 is in no means a 2-in-1 device, so I do not really know what Acer is trying to do with this feature, but you can have the screen flat on a surface if you want. The hinge does have a bit of range, and that might keep the screen from snapping off.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Keyboard And Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard on the Acer Aspire 1 is very impressive, the keys have ample travel, and they are decent to type on. The keys are also a bit larger than usual which is great for typing. The only issue is that the placement of some keys can take a bit of getting used to. You will need to adjust to the arrangement of the small arrow keys and the buttons next to the Enter and Backspace keys. This is not a major issue, and once you have used the device for a few hours, you should get used to it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Review-Keyboard-and-Touchpad.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="750" height="590" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is much better than some previous <a title="All Acer Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> that we have used in the past, and the overall design is decent. The touchpad is not all that great though. It is a bit wobbly, but it will get the job done. It uses Windows Precision drivers and supports gestures as well. Compared to the HP Stream 14, the keyboard is fine, but the touchpad could have been better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks of Laptops for Writers with Comfortable Keyboards</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The webcam on the Aspire 1 is another thing after speakers that Acer has compromised to price it competitively. Acer has fitted a very bad webcam on this laptop which produces an unacceptable picture and video quality, even as per the budget laptop standards. The picture that I took of mine with its webcam came out entirely out of focus, grainy and with vanished colors.</p>
<p>So, if you have to make a lot of video calls everyday or attend the video conferences, then this is not the right laptop for you unless you are ready to spend a bit extra for an <a title="External Webcams on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LH16yf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">external webcam</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode which is excellent for students and individuals who need added security. For uninitiated, the S mode limits the third party apps that you can download, and you can only use apps that are verified by Microsoft and are available on the official Microsoft store. Well, if you don&#8217;t like it, opting out of the S mode is not an issue, and you can move to regular Windows 10 Home with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Software-and-Warranty-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Software and Warranty Review" width="735" height="550" /></p>
<p>Along with Window 10, there are a couple of other apps and games as well that come pre-installed. These include the Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Friends Saga, Cooking Fever, Township, Royal Revolt 2, Fitbit Coach, Photastic Collage, ACG player and Amazon. All these apps can be uninstalled, so it&#8217;s not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The laptop also comes with a free year of Office 365 and the Acer Product registration app which you will need to register your device, check the warranty and get customer support.<br />

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 is a netbook with the dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM, so I did not have high hopes when testing the device and it seems that I was right for the most part. The 4 GB of RAM is a major limitation, and it took only four Chrome tabs to get the device to slow down. With eight tabs open in Chrome and one of them playing a YouTube video, there was a noticeable lag when typing.</p>
<p>While this is not a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming machine</a>, we did play Asphalt 9 on the device, and it ran well. There was no noticeable lag, but then again, the game is very well optimized and will even run on smartphones. We also tried Cooking Fever that came pre-installed, and that ran fine as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Real-Life-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Real Life Performance" width="527" height="700" /></p>
<p>As far as thermals are concerned, the device’s bottom does get a bit warm even while normal multi-tasking possibly because of its fanless design. It can be problematic for users like me who like to use the laptop by keeping it on the lap. However, it was completely usable when kept on the table, and its keyboard and palm rest area didn’t show any signs of heat which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Acer Aspire 1 isn&#8217;t great when it comes to multitasking and although it will run games found on the official store just fine, you cannot expect to play games on it. Opening multiple apps or even Chrome tabs will slow it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>Recommended: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The claimed battery life of the 2018 Acer Aspire 1 is around 6.5 hours, and in our tests, it managed to last for 7 hours and 12 minutes which is decent, but there are options in the market that will give you 8-9 hours of battery backup. That is a factor worth considering if you are someone who has to rely a lot on battery power every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laptop took 2 hours and 17 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% which is also a little longer than the other laptops. So, the battery on the Acer Aspire 1 takes its time to charge and does not offer much in terms of battery life either.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Under $200 &#8211; Our Most Recommended Inexpensive Laptops</a></strong></em> </div></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Laptop-Review-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Laptop Review - Featured Image" width="650" height="483" /></p>
<p>One of the strongest points of the Acer Aspire 1 is its 14-inch full HD display which makes hard to find a substitute for this laptop. Moreover, it offers plenty of ports and comes with modern wireless connectivity options so that you can take advantage of high-speed internet and connect your wireless devices. Although its speakers lack in clarity and have an awful webcam, one cannot go wrong with it considering it costs just $250.</p>
<p>So, overall the Acer Aspire 1 is a solid laptop for the price if you consume content online or work with documents. It can handle some mobile games that are available on the Microsoft store and is a well-built machine overall. The storage and RAM are the limiting factors, but if all you need is a device on which you can create documents, browse the web and watch movies, then this is one of the best inexpensive laptops right now that will get the job done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer Aspire series of laptops are undeniably a complete value for money devices. After spending months on premium laptops, I have got the budget segment Acer Aspire E 15 laptop to review. It is a common tendency to focus on the flaws and deficits the laptop has as the styling, form-factor, features, and specifications of a budget laptop are definitely far behind that of premium devices.</p>
<p>However, to my surprise, the Aspire E 15 stood up really well exceeding my expectations from a laptop priced under $400. Quite frankly, you’ll have a hard time in finding a laptop with impressive specifications, a reliable battery backup, a full HD display, and an abundant amount of RAM <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for less than $400</a>. But, Acer has again hit the sweet spot in the budget segment and their 2018 Acer Aspire E 15 notebook offers all the current generation hardware with the steeped down price tag of just $379!</p>
<p>But, how is the build quality? And, how does it perform in real world? Let’s drill down to the detailed review of Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) laptop and find out if it really is the best budget laptop of 2018.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Usually, when a 15-inch laptop strikes in your mind, there is already a typical image in everyone’s mind and it is the very first and most common impression users get. However, it is not the same case with the Aspire E 15. The laptop although comes with an old-school design pattern, like most of the other 15-inch laptops, it comes with good ergonomics.</p>
<p>Weighing at 5.27 pounds, the laptop is a tab heavy and bulky. However, thanks to its design and engineering, the weight is very uniformly distributed all across the device, making it easy to carry around.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3869 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Design-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H 15-inch Laptop - Design &amp; Build Quality" width="550" height="480" /></p>
<p>The laptop looks completely identical to the last year&#8217;s model as its design has been carried forward from its predecessor (<a title="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop Review – A Solid Budget-Friendly Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e15-e5-575-33bm-laptop-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E5-575-33BM</a>) which is fine because Acer is providing better specs on this year&#8217;s model by cutting down its designing and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>As far as build quality is concerned, the laptop is built from a high quality poly-carbonate plastic and it is finished in black color and has a textured lid which gives it a rather aging yet professional look. The device comes with almost the standard dimensions in terms of length, width, and height and measures 15.02 x 10.2 x 1.19 inches. The laptop feels sturdy but it does have some amount of keyboard and screen flexes which are acceptable considering the price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the port alignment on the device, you get a DVD drive, a charging port, a USB port, and an audio jack aligned with the right edge of the device. On the left edge, you get a couple of USB ports, an HDMI port, and a LAN port, neatly recessed.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins, sans-serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: inherit; letter-spacing: -1px;">Display</span></p>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD display. The display panel on the laptop is an LED-backlit one, which offers decent resolution for all the essential everyday uses. It sports a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which also makes it one among the very few laptops offering a Full HD resolution in the segment.</p>
<div id="attachment_3870" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-image-3870 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-Laptop-Display-.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H Laptop Review - Display" width="650" height="447" /><p id="caption-attachment-3870" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>15.6&#8243; Full HD Display &#8211; Best in Segment</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Although the laptop had a decent color accuracy, the brightness was relatively low at only 175 nits. However, the laptop’s display had punchy blacks and decent contrast levels. Watching quality video content on the laptop will be satisfying but the display’s underwhelming brightness might be a bit of concern for some users. However, considering the price point, the display is definitely serviceable.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 comes with latest and top of the line specifications for the asking price. Under the hood, the device sports an 8th generation Intel Core i3-8130U dual-core processor which is the biggest highlight of this year&#8217;s model. The Coffee Lake Intel Core i3 processor is clocked at 2.2 GHz and under full throttle it can turbo boost up to 3.4GHz. The latest processor also comes with an Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics for better overall graphical performance.</p>

<p>The latest processor on the device is paired with a 6GB of RAM which is 2GB more than the last year&#8217;s model, however it is slower DDR3L RAM and this laptop&#8217;s 4+2 RAM configuration also eats up both of its RAM slots. But the good news is, RAM on the laptop can be upgraded up to whopping 32GB. As far as storage on the device is concerned, it is managed by a slow 5400 RPM 1TB hard drive which can also be replaced easily with an SSD.</p>

<p>The laptop also comes with an 8X DVD Double-Layer RW (M-Disc enabled) drive which can read and write from any CD or a DVD.</p>
<h4>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h4>
<p>The Aspire E 15 comes with a backlit keyboard, which is a very rare scene for a laptop priced under $400. The keyboard provides a very comfortable typing experience and comes with a very sturdy and sharp key. The keys provide very good tactile feedback while using and this definitely adds on to the great typing experience. On our typing tests, I hit a rate of 72 words per minute, which is great. One should have absolutely no issues in using this laptop’s keyboard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3871 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-Keyboard-and-Touchpad-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 Keyboard and Touchpad review" width="750" height="445" /></p>

<p>The touchpad on the device is also very neatly recessed and is very spacious. It does the job adequately well and it comes with both the left and right clickers, like the usual touchpad on a keyboard.</p>
<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The laptop comes with an abundant number of ports and other connectivity options, which makes the laptop stand out in the segment. It sports 1 x USB 2.0 port, 1 x USB Type-C port, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, a physical Ethernet port, an HDMI port, an audio jack, and an SD card reader slot.</p>
<div id="attachment_1607" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1607" class="wp-image-1607 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-576-392H Ports &amp; Slots" width="800" height="94" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-300x35.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-768x90.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-610x72.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-600x71.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-50x6.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1607" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Comes with USB Type-C, Ethernet, HDMI, VGA, USB 3.0 ports and DVD RW Drive</strong></em></p></div>
<p>On top of this, the device also comes with a VGA and a DVD writer for the ease of usage.</p>

<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop comes with an HD webcam which sports a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. The webcam on the device also supports High Dynamic Range, for better imaging and rendering during a video call or telephony. However, the camera isn’t that great when it comes to capturing some still photographs. The image tends to get a little smoothened and blurred out, losing out on a lot of details in the image. The sensor is, however, fast enough to render the image and adjust it on the screen quickly. Having said that all, the camera on the device serves the cause.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer has always been an exceptionally good multipurpose laptop manufacturer. Accordingly, their Aspire E 15 notebook comes equipped with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two built-in stereo speakers</span> for a surround sound effect. We used the laptop to play heavy music including various genres such as metal, symphony, and mid-focused vocals. The laptop did well and has a powerful sound, which can fill a small room.</p>
<p>In terms of software, the speakers are powered by the company’s proprietary True Harmony sound, which ensures quality audio output with more depth and details. This adds on to the experience while watching movies and playing games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Production &amp; DJing</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As for watching videos is concerned, the laptop can take it almost any video format at any resolution and play it with ease. We played true 4K content to which the laptop had no struggle playing it whatsoever.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H), being a sub-$400 budget laptop, is still an excellent multimedia performer.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E 15 runs on the latest Windows 10 Operating system, which is confined to the Home variant by default. Apart from housing some of the proprietary applications form the company, the laptop also packs in some additional applications, which we want to term as bloatware.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we personally felt that the laptop comes with slightly more bloatware than that of an ordinary Windows 10 running laptop. Nonetheless, one can easily uninstall the preinstalled apps with ease. The <a title="Acer Laptops Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> come with Acer Recovery management application, which we feel is quite handy, especially if you’re someone who wants to explore more out of your device. Often, people mess up with it and lose their valuable data.</p>
<p>The display of the device comes with two settings, which can be chosen by the user as per their requirements. It comes with a third-party file explorer app known as the ‘App Explorer’, which organizes and sorts the files and folders in the laptop in a slightly better manner. It also comes with CyberLink PowerDVD 14 by default, to run the inbuilt DVD writer.</p>
<p>We faced absolutely no hiccups or hurdles while using the laptop during our review, and the software on the device, never really bothered us despite the bloatware it packs in.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Intel Core i3-8130U processor paired with the 6GB of memory in the Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576-392H laptop provides enough power and speed for productive multitasking on the laptop. During our review, we had multiple multitasking sessions and the laptop did quite well. We even used split screen feature of Windows to play a YouTube video in full HD resolution and running a bunch of benchmarks simultaneously, to which the laptop did quite well, without any lags or stutter.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3874" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-E5-576-392H-15-inch-Laptop-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) 15-inch Laptop Review" width="550" height="530" /></p>
<p>Speaking about our benchmarks, the laptop scored a decent 7,140 on the Geekbench, which gives a pretty much overall performance of the device. This is on par with all the laptops priced under $400. However, the 1TB hard disk drive provided with the laptop had poor read, write and data transfer speeds.</p>
<p>We almost tested out all the connectivity options on the laptop too and it didn’t disappoint us. The device was latching on to the Wi-Fi networks quickly and had a good connectivity range.</p>
<p>As far as the gaming on the device is concerned, considering the price, one should be aware of the fact that, it is not meant for heavy gaming. However, the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics chipset does well for basic gaming. We tested the laptop with some mediocre games such as Dirt 3 racing with graphics set to minimal-medium levels and the laptop did well handling the game and graphics. However, one cannot expect to run heavy games on the device. But what you’re getting in this device at this price range makes it a total steal for the buck.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>Our current laptop, the Acer Aspire E 15 (E5-576-392H) comes with a 6-cell Li-Ion battery (each 2,800 mAh), which makes it one of the very few devices to come with a 6-cell offering in the segment. Accordingly, the device gives an exceptional battery backup of over 7-8 hours on a continuous usage. Although the company claims that the laptop will give a battery life of over 13 hours, it doesn’t really stand true.</p>
<p>The device takes slightly over 2 hours to charge fully from 0 to 100, which is rather okay for most users. The laptop’s battery life didn’t let us down whatsoever during our usage and this is definitely one of the strong zones of this device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3875" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Aspire-E-15-best-budget-laptop-of-2018-review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E 15 - best budget laptop of 2018 review" width="700" height="320" /></p>
<p>If you’re someone asking us ‘Should I buy this laptop?’, then the answer is ‘YES’ blindfolded. That said, there is undeniably no better competitor for the laptop at this price range, yet. It has powerful innards, offers good performance, lasts long in terms of battery life, and comes with powerful multimedia abilities. What more can you expect from a laptop at this price range?</p>
<p>However, we would have been taken by a storm, if the device had an even brighter display, as that is one of the very few areas, where the laptop falls short.</p>

It has won various accolades worldwide from common users to the tech community.</p>
<p>The R11 is promised to provide a comfortable user experience, competent performance with its long lasting battery life. But is the Google’s browser-stationed Chrome OS designed to be used with a touchscreen display? Is it powerful enough to handle our everyday essentials?

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are inevitably difficult to be made. Reason? They have to stay inexpensive yet provide good performance and the most difficult part, it has to compete with the market that’s now full of Chromebooks available for dirt cheap prices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3310" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11" width="469" height="332" /></p>
<p>The R11 is launched with a base price of under $300 and therefore, it has to deliver a lot for the asking price. As far as the design and built factor are concerned, the R11 comes with an 11.6-inch screen size which is decked out in a very clean and tidy chassis. The laptop comes with a diamond patterned finish from the outside which gives an additional level of grip, making it easy to hold and carry. Although the company (Acer) claims that the outer lid of the laptop is made up of aluminum, we felt that it was feeble and the design wasn’t very solidly built.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R11-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 - Lid" width="372" height="260" /></p>
<p>Having that said, the laptop offers great ergonomics, which you hardly get at this price point. The device comes with compact measurements at 11.6 x 8.03 x 0.76 inches which fit well in bags. Moreover, it weighs just about 2.7 pounds, which is yet another add-on.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a 360-degrees hinge, which is the core of its convertible aspect. The laptop flips well and can be used in four different modes.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen HD WideScreen LED-backlit display with a resolution of 1366&#215;768 pixels. The screen comes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, which now is a standard and common thing we see in most of the laptops.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible - Display" width="700" height="507" /></p>
<p>The laptop offers good color gamut and also manages to provide decent viewing angles. However, what made us disappointed is that the laptop’s display is not adequately bright which makes the outdoor usage a bit cumbersome. Even at the brightness set to maximum, the display didn’t felt very bright, which affects the crispness and contrasts of the regular usage. During our benchmarking, the laptop managed to score a mere 225 nits of brightness, which is subpar considering its contenders which manage to score over 300 nits.</p>
<p>When we put the laptop display’s color reproduction to test, we got a decent 74% of sRGB spectrum, which is very well on top of other Chromebooks priced similarly. We also used the device to watch some high-quality movies and other content, to which the display responded well and gave us a decent experience minus the brightness.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C1LK) is stuffed with decent specifications for the asking price. The device is powered by a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor paired with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM. The processor, however, can be throttled up to 2.08GHz through the Intel’s Burst technology.</p>

<p>The display as mentioned above is an 11.6-inch HD display, which comes with a 10-point multi-touch support. Storage segment on the device is backed by a 32GB of solid-state drive internal storage which is very less and that&#8217;s the problem with every Chromebook these days. Thankfully, like most others, the Acer Chromebook R11 also comes with an SD card slot to add more storage.<br />

<h4>Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with one USB 3.0 port for faster, better, and reliable data transfers and comes with another USB 2.0 port to add on an additional peripheral. The R11 also houses one HDMI Port, an SD card reader, a 3.5mm audio jack and a charging port.</p>
<div id="attachment_3315" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-image-3315 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible Laptop" width="650" height="398" /><p id="caption-attachment-3315" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Chromebook R 11 offers USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card Slot and 3.5mm Audio Jack</strong></em></p></div>
<p>For the connectivity, the Acer Chromebook R11 is packed with the latest MIMO 802.11ac wireless technology to support smooth, reliable, and interruption free internet browsing experience. It comes with Dual-Band support to house both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks with ease.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Chromebook R11 comes with a 720p HD front-facing webcam. The camera like most of the other laptops doesn’t offer any fancy stuff here. The camera takes images with noise and doesn’t produce accurate colors. However, it will suffice your occasional Skype or Hangout calls. The images captured looks a bit muffled. However, the image adjusts quickly on the frame.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The R11 doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned, on what OS does the device runs on. It runs on the latest Chrome OS, which is powered by Google. Google also promised, regular updates, to keep the device safe and lag-free. Although there isn’t much to say about the OS, we want our viewers to know that almost all the tasks in the Chromebooks are confined in a web UI, i.e in the browser.</p>
<p>It might be exciting to know that, Google also promised that the Chromebooks, will soon be able to run Android applications. However, as of now, the R11 doesn’t run android applications. We expect Google to roll the compatibility in an iterative process in the near future.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Chromebooks are not as powerful as the other Windows OS based counterparts. However, the devices manage to impress with their sturdy performance. Although the devices come with a moderately powerful set of hardware, it’s the light-weight software of the Chrome OS, which makes the things smooth and easy.</p>
<p>As said earlier, the Acer Chromebook R11 comes with a 1.6GHz Intel Celeron processor and a 4GB of RAM. This set of hardware is powerful enough to house most of our daily essentials. To test this, we used the device extensively and here is what we’ve felt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Acer-Chromebook-R-11-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R 11 - Performance" width="480" height="298" /></p>
<p>The R11 handled almost all the basic tasks with ease. Browsing the internet, watching videos, multimedia usage, and editing documents were smooth and lag free. The device takes considerably negligible boot up time and loads very quickly. The device tends to get slightly heated when throttled to its full potential. However, the heat remains in limit and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to use. Being a Chromebook, users need to keep their expectations in check. That said, a Chromebook is far from <a title="Top 8 Best Budget Gaming Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming</a>, and other heavy graphic-demanding applications.</p>
<p>The keyboard on the R11 is neat and sturdy and feels solid to type on. The trackpad is rightly placed and comes with adequate space for the palm rest while using.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Writers</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Chromebook we expect the device to handle Chrome browser with ease. Since almost all the tasks in the device are performed in a web interface, we rapidly switched between a dozen tabs in Chrome, to which the device responded really well. We also managed to run a couple of benchmarks to get a lucid view of the performance of the device, and here is what we’ve managed to achieve with the R11. It scored an 8,200 in Octane and close to 5000 on Mozilla Kraken. These benchmarks correspond to the ability to run scripts in the browser and overall performance.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Chromebook R11 although can be a decent multimedia companion, but the device isn’t any groundbreaking in the segment. Discredits to its dull display and muffled speaker output, you will have to keep your expectations in check.</p>
<p>The device can play almost all formats of video content with ease and we didn’t face any lag or frame drops. The speakers are considerably loud but however, the sound tends to get crackled at higher volumes.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>During our time with the device, the Chromebook R11 lasted slightly over 10 hours on a single charge. The device is backed by a 3220mAh battery and the battery backup of the Chromebook is what makes it a very worthy contender in the segment. The device gets fully charged from 0 to 100 in about 2 hours, and stays juiced up to handle all your essentials.</p>
<p>All that said, Battery backup is undeniably a very strong aspect of the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1904 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook R11 CB3-131-C3SZ 11.6 Inch Touchscreen Laptop" width="450" height="344" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop.jpg 450w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-300x229.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Acer-Chromebook-R11-CB3-131-C3SZ-11.6-Inch-Touchscreen-Laptop-50x38.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Acer Chromebook R11 with impeccable battery life and convertible option makes it a very good buy for the asking price. The touchscreen option, and very neatly recessed keyboard and trackpad make it an easy to use it. However, like with every laptop, it certainly has its own hits and misses. The laptop’s display is dull and the audio output is pretty mediocre.</p>
<p>However, if one is ready to trade off those two aspects with the long-lasting battery backup and stable performance, the Acer Chromebook R11 is certainly a value for money investment. It is also worth considering that most of the other contenders in the price range fall behind the R11 when it comes to performance and versatility that it offers.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes in a polycarbonate chassis and is cladded in a charcoal-grey exterior. The laptop comes with a brushed metal finish, which adds to the premium factor for the laptop. It is thin, compact, portable, and comes with a beautiful tactile finish. Thanks to its texture and form-factor, the laptop offers good grip to carry around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3052 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-14-Inch-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14 Inch Laptop - Design" width="650" height="324" /></p>
<p>The laptop weighs just around 3.6 pounds and measures 13.5 x 9.65 x 0.71 inches, which is now a standard for these <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2017" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inchers</a>. The screen is surrounded by thick bezels in a matte-black bezel, and rubber cladding covering all sides. All the ports and connectors are neatly recessed at either side of the laptop.</p>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop features a 180-degree hinge, so the keyboard and screen can lay flat together. This feature makes it an ideal choice for a group of kids to huddle around a desk and allows the users to adjust the screen to whatever level, they are most comfortable with.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3053 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop Keyboard" width="600" height="375" /></p>
<p>On a conclusive note about the design and finish of the Aspire 1, although the laptop doesn’t offer a lot of fancy flairs, it certainly ticks all the design essentials including built quality, finish, grip, and portability.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2017 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Laptops for College Students of 2017</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 14-inch Full HD display, which is a rare scene for a <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptop priced under $300</a>. It comes with a widescreen display with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels. Considering the specifications, the laptop is unarguably a great bargain for the price. Now let’s speak about its real-time performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3054 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Full-HD-Display.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Full HD Display" width="800" height="596" /></p>
<p>The device comes with a very crisp and sharp display panel, which offers adequate colors with precision. During our review, we extensively used the laptop to watch high definition content and 4K content. When I viewed the aforementioned content, I noticed that although the blacks on the screen were slightly dull and less punchy, it was able to reproduce good color gamut, which we hardly see in a laptop at this price.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Although the design is one of the strong points of the Acer Aspire 1, the hardware and specifications are yet another unique selling point of this laptop. It sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-Core Processor which can throttle up to 2.2GHz. The processor is paired with a 4GB of RAM to handle multitasking and applications on the device. The device comes with a mere 32GB of onboard storage, which <strong>cannot</strong> be, however, further expanded by putting a bigger SSD or HDD.</p>
<p>Graphics on the laptop are handled by the CPU&#8217;s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU, which although isn’t meant to handle high-end games, can still take on moderate graphics with ease. Other specifications of the device include connectivity options such as 802.11ac WiFi featuring MIMO technology. It also sports a dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz to boost up the connectivity speeds.</p>
<p>Considering the price point at which the laptop is being sold, trading-off with some hardware feels absolutely fine. As long as your expectations are in check, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop will not disappoint you.<br />

<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop comes with a VGA front facing webcam, which does the work of capturing images and aiding video calls. The maximum resolution of the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 is 640&#215;480  pixels. The images captured on the camera felt slightly underwhelming and turned out grainy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2875 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Acer-Aspire-1-14-inch-full-HD-Laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 14-inch full HD Laptop" width="550" height="312" /></p>
<p>The video calls on the laptop were serviceable. On a conclusive note, the webcam on the Acer Aspire 1 doesn’t come with anything worth mentioning but it certainly does the basics well.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 offers a long list of connectivity options and ports. All the ports and connectivity slots on this laptop are equally distributed on its either sides. Accordingly, it sports 1 USB 3.0 Port, a HDMI port with HDCP support, and an SD card reader on its left edge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3056 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-31-C4HH-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Ports and Slots" width="1000" height="307" /></p>
<p>Whereas the right corner of the laptop contains 2 USB 2.0 ports and a 3.5mm Audio Jack.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Acer preloads the Aspire 1 with the Windows 10 Home variant and with just a handful of utilities that makes the laptop free from unnecessary bloatware. The laptop also comes with some of the Acer’s proprietary software and tools including the Acer Care Center, which monitors the system health and provides the information about the software updates.</p>
<p>Like in most of the latest Acer laptops, The Aspire 1’s Power Button comes with a customisable option to perform multiple options. And all these options can be customised and easily set through the Windows 10 control panel. Speaking about the Acer Quick Access, the software allows you to quickly enable or disable the blue light-reduction mode and aids in setting up a quick hotspot.</p>
<p>Apart from them, the laptop comes with a standard load of casual games, tools, and trialware. On a conclusive note, the laptop does offer a sturdy and well-rounded software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Top 10 Best Laptops Under $200</strong></em></a></div></div>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 as mentioned above comes with a decent set of specifications. However, specifications alone cannot predict the regular daily usage. The laptop takes about 10-12 seconds to boot the Windows 10, which is rather slow. All the apps take a while to load and heavy applications such as the Chrome might take another 5-10 seconds to show up. Thankfully, the RAM management on the device seems to work just fine and multi-tasking was good and smooth.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, we pushed it to its complete throttle and threw a hard set of applications and requests simultaneously. The laptop to our surprise did pretty well, and was able to handle most of the tasks well.</p>
<p>As far as the benchmarks are concerned, the Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH laptop performs well in numbers considering the specifications. We managed to get a handsome 2044 and 2100 points in PCMark 8, which are very commendable considering the processor. While the number always doesn’t reflect the performance, all we can say is, we were pretty satisfied with the overall performance of the Aspire 1.</p>
<p>Speaking about the gaming capabilities of this budget-friendly notebook, it is provided with the Intel’s integrated Intel HD Graphics 500 GPU. Do note that, the laptop doesn’t come with any other additional graphics processor and is, therefore, not an ideal machine, if you&#8217;re looking for a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming-stationed laptop</a>. Although it is capable of rendering decent graphics and pictures in the videos and lighter games, it simply cannot run high-end games.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 comes with a pair of built-in stereo speakers, which are neither weak nor are groundbreaking. That said, the speakers are powerful enough to pump up an audio experience in a small room. The speakers are capable of providing clear and distortion free audio output.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3057" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Acer-Aspire-1-Speakers-and-Audio-Quality.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 Speakers and Audio Quality" width="700" height="392" /></p>
<p>We played some HD, Full HD, and 4K content on this laptop, to which it responded well. Thanks to its full HD display, the colors were well reproduced and we had a good time using the laptop as a source of entertainment and multimedia.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 comes with a 2-cell Li-Ion Battery of 4810 mAh. The laptop being provided with the right set of hardware and features, it provides a very impressive battery backup of up to 9 hours of continuous usage.</p>
<p>During our time with the laptop, it did provide exceptionally good backup and was able to provide a screen on time of over 8 hours on one full charge. The laptop gets fully charged in just under 2 hours 30 minutes, which we feel is pretty ideal. It is worth noting that, the laptop doesn’t get warm even while charging and using it simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3049" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/acer-aspire-1-a114-31-c4hh-laptop.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-31-C4HH Laptop" width="500" height="310" /></p>
<p>Acer Aspire 1 is a mixed bag. That said, there are aspects which makes it tough to believe that it’s a laptop priced at around $200. While, on the other hand, few aspects of the laptop really disappoints, especially, the non-expendable internal storage. Considering every aspect of the laptop, it is quite evident by now that the Acer Aspire 1 is a very affordable and an excellent value for money notebook. For those, who are tight on budget, but wants to stay productive through the versatility of a laptop, then it’s undeniable that there is no better substitute for the Acer Aspire 1, in its segment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop had everyone on the edge with the announcement of its launch. The market did go through a bump with its launch and today standards of laptop cum tablets have evolved drastically. Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible is certainly not the best dual tech gadget to possess but it certainly has led the way to such marvellous development.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus is a first of its generation;&nbsp;as this is the first convertible Chromebook ever made by Samsung and there&#8217;s lot more to talk about it.</p>
<p>The one reason for which the&nbsp;new Chromebook line ups from Samsung have became the subject of talks everywhere is, they now support the Google Play Store. So, just like your Android phone or tablet you can download and have access to millions of apps and games with the convenience of keyboard and touchpad.</p>
<p>Well, there are still few problems that we faced&nbsp;with software on our review unit like stuttering of apps and games in fullscreen but we think that it can be fixed with the quick software update. To get more deeper insight on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus&nbsp;go through our full review&nbsp;below.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2475" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Tablet Mode and Stylus" width="590" height="452">The stylus also facilities easier drawing and screenshot capture for future reference. The metal top allows the owner to use it in adverse conditions without wear and tear issues. The Samsung Chromebook Plus also has a USB Port and stylus parking space. The side part of the laptop is used wisely to house the volume and power button. One can easily reach those buttons on side while using&nbsp;this laptop and control the volume.</p>
<p>With the dimensions being 11.04 x 8.72 x 0.55 inches, this laptop is comparably on the lighter side when it comes to weight. While all the other laptops are 3.2 lbs or 3 lbs, this amazing laptop is just 2.4lbs heavy. The lightweight model and long battery life allows people to take it along into the woods and enjoy their outings like never before.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>Display of Samsung Chromebook Plus is something that puts it ahead of all the popular modern day laptops. The facility to move the screen and adjust according to your viewing angle is like a gift to mankind. Now people can enjoy the best of movies by moving into their beds or by reclining on a comfortable couch. The moving screen also facilitates conversion of the laptop into a tablet. The tablet view is very much idle for surfing and reading; one can finally capture screenshots and also bookmark quotes only to revisit them later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2476" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Display-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus - Display" width="600" height="400">The LED-Lit screen with a resolution of 2400X1600 pixels is not so good for a laptop but highly impressive from a tablet’s point of view.

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop has been in news for a long time now, the quality display and the impressive design had people in awe but what about the technical specifications? Are they equally worthy of praises?</p>
<p>This laptop comes with an ARM-based OPI processor, well a lot of you might be thinking, it does not have an <a title="Find best Intel processor laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel processor</a>, must not be good, then let me tell you, ARM based processors work best with the Android Applications. Since Samsung Chromebook is based on Chrome OS and not Windows, ARM-based OPI Processors are the best. These processors are going to facilitate a greater run for applications and also provide eloquent streaming of high-quality videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>While the processor is really good with HD videos, it seems to skip a few frames when processing a 4K video. The Pro version is supposed to have covered such petty issues.</p>
<p>The 4GB of RAM is good enough to power a processor with speed of 2 GHz, one can easily brag about their tablet cum laptop possessing such high processing power.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2477" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Touch-Laptop-Stand-Mode-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop Stand Mode" width="600" height="439">32GB of Flash Storage is something that is going to upset a lot of people and affect their final decision. The storage provided is extremely low in comparison to what other laptops come with but then one can consider 32GB of Flash Storage good enough for a tablet. Also, it is facilitated with the microSD card slot so there&#8217;s always an option to expand the memory.</p>
<p>Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible has a processor count of 6, which makes it easier for people to launch a good number of apps simultaneously. Designed to support multitasking this chromebook&nbsp;will see people accomplishing a lot of work at the same time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>RELATED: <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Best Laptops Under $500</a></strong></em></p>
<h4>Bluetooth &amp; Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>With the fastest Bluetooth 4.0 this laptop is designed to send and receive signals at a better speed. 802.11 Wi-Fi is good enough to facilitate easier connection establishment and faster web browsing.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this laptop can process some of the toughest files with great ease. The 4GB of RAM, processor with a speed of 2GHz are designed to process all kind of requests and file quite efficiently. Thanks to the efficient set of hardware for a lightweight OS like Chrome, the Samsung Chromebook Plus provides impeccable performance without much stutter or lag.</p>
<div id="attachment_2478" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-image-2478 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Touch-Laptop-Size-1.jpeg" alt="Think Light and Convertible Samsung Chromebook Plus" width="428" height="445"><p id="caption-attachment-2478" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>0.51&#8243; Thickness &nbsp;| &nbsp;2.38lbs weight</strong></p></div>
<p>The processor provided with the laptop can house all the sufficient power needed to run most of the applications you throw at it. Moreover, thanks to the browser-based interface of the laptop, multitasking on the laptop is pretty smooth and does the tasks efficiently. In addition to all this said, this convertible laptop remains very quiet even under heavy usage, which is very consoling considering the price, form-factor, and performance of this laptop. The laptop sometimes tend to get slightly warmed up under heavy usage, but we’d like to inform you guys that its just near to negligible. All in all, the Samsung Chromebook Plus offers good overall performance at the budget.</p>
<h4>Touchscreen &amp; Stylus</h4>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2479 aligncenter" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Drawing-with-Samsung-Pen-1.jpeg" alt="Drawing with Samsung Pen" width="650" height="381">The input features provided with this laptop are exceptional, one can use the touchscreen to make the drawings more detailed and videos more intricate. The stylus facilitates easier selection, bookmarking and also screen capturing. The stylus on Samsung phones are already impressive and we are glad that&nbsp;they included the same stylus with same functionalities on the new Samsung Chromebook Plus as well. The touchscreen display on this chromebook is also&nbsp;pressure sensitive so this chromebook can really do wonders with&nbsp;photo editing and graphics designing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You may like to check: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops for Photo Editing &#8211; Our Top 10 Picks</a></strong></em></p>
<h3>Operating System</h3>
<p>This laptop makes an exception with the operating system. Not functioning on Windows just like the other contemporaries, this laptop runs on Chrome Operating System, which makes it easier for people to run all the applications they have on their phones on this gadget as well. Chrome OS is going to lead the innovation in this sector, enterprises from all faces of life are now going to concentrate on innovation and come up with really smart and newer versions of operating system.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>With the dedicated integrated graphic card, 4GB of RAM and 2 GHz processor speed, users can run all the games they play on their mobile devices. The Chrome OS supports Google Play Stores and all the applications listed on this store. The experience is going to be amazing for everyone who loves games from Google Play Store. One can make the wise use of 4GB of RAM and experience the output.</p>
<p>However, we’d like to add a point here, although the laptop is powerful enough to handle light-weighted games, a Chromebook isn&#8217;t meant for real-time gaming. That said, you could always play internet based flash games or normal arcade games available on Play Store with ease, but games like Asphalt 4 still&nbsp;struggles to run smoothly on this laptop. We think Google still needs to refine Chrome OS a bit for more smoother gaming on Chromebooks.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The audio and video impresses the masses because it supports the varied file formats of audio and video. For its audio performance, we tried playing some high-quality encoded audio Flacs and the laptop to our surprise was handling them with ease. The sound quality was good and decent and was loud enough to cover an entire small room. For the video quality, we tried playing some HD, Full HD, and 4K video content, which also responded really well. The colours reproduced on the screen were accurate and were true to life. All in all, the Samsung&nbsp;Chromebook Plus is also a very good multimedia-stationed convertible device.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The battery life of Samsung Chromebook Plus is quite exceptional, only a handful of laptops provide above 10 hours of&nbsp;battery backup while none of the tablets do. This Laptop cum tablet can stay juiced up to 11 continuous hours so that you never have to worry about carrying your charger again.&nbsp;Apart from that, this chromebook &nbsp;gets fully charged in slightly over 2 hours, which is again a strong point of this laptop. The beauty of Chrome OS based laptops is that, the OS used here is pretty light weight and doesn&#8217;t consume much of the hardware or resources to get the work done, this way, the battery life remains exceptional under everyday usage.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2480" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Samsung-Chromebook-Plus-Convertible-Laptop-Bottom-Line-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Laptop Review" width="708" height="472">Samsung Chromebook Plus convertible laptop is the undisputed winner when it comes to providing people with an incomparable user experience. The quality audio, video, processing power, long battery life and light weight body are just other reasons why you should bet your money on this laptop. The only thing disappointing about this laptop is the storage space. The 32GB of Flash storage will restrict people from storing their favourite movies and enjoy them when either travelling or stuck at workplace with nothing to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days, when the terms such as premium, sleek, stylish, and attractive were meant only for the high-end laptops. With almost all the laptop makers understanding the demand for budget-friendly laptops, started to bring their portfolio of laptops at lesser prices to meet the requirements of an audience. This not only paved way for the prices of laptops to come down, but also marked the new standards in even the budget-friendly laptops such as our current Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM laptop.<span id="more-1880"></span></p>
<p>Acer, as always has delivered a solidly performing laptop in the global market. And the best part is that the laptop costs you just around $350. The laptop was launched with a lot of expectations to compete against the already crowded <a title="Our Top Picks of Laptops Under $500" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under $500 segment</a>.

It apart from packing in all the latest set of specifications, also comes in a stylish and premium looking chassis, which gives it an edge over its competitors.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the aforementioned aspects and huge response from the users, we decided to have a look at this laptop, and this is what we feel of it.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM takes a lot of cues from the previous <a title="Checkout Best Acer Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aspire series of laptops from Acer</a> but has certainly got some improvements in terms of design and ergonomics. The laptop comes with an all-plastic exterior chassis but comes with a minimalistic yet aesthetic design. It comes in an all black colour variant with both matte and shiny finish, as a result of which the laptop gives an industrial feel, which most of the rigid users would aspire to have.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM Laptop - Design" width="793" height="320" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design.jpg 793w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-300x121.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-768x310.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-610x246.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-600x242.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Design-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" />Speaking of the dimensions of the laptop, it comes with the standard sizes as one would expect from a 15.6-inch laptop. It measures, 15.0 x 10.2 x 1.2 inches and weighs around 5.3 pounds. The laptop with that weight feels quite chunky, but thanks to its ergonomics, it feels easy to carry around.</p>

<p>As far as the keyboard and trackpad on the laptop are concerned, we believe that the keyboard is the deal breaker for few here. The laptop comes with a mere 1.6mm of key travel space and an actuation of just 58-gram. As a result, these keys doesn&#8217;t even sound near to perfection and is just passable by productivity-laptop standards. The keyboard is backlit enabled but the numbers on the keyboard can be quite misleading at times. We put the laptop’s keyboard to test on our typing tests on TypingTest.com and I managed to score around 116 words per minute with around seven errors, compared to 130 words per minute with around five-six errors on my MacBook Air. The trackpad also disappointed us quite a couple of times, by not taking the gesture inputs properly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1890" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM Laptop - Keyboard" width="600" height="351" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard-300x176.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard-515x300.jpg 515w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Keyboard-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<p>On an overall conclusive note on the design of this laptop, it surely is a good looking laptop for the asking price but is slightly heavy with the keyboard and trackpad to blame for.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM features a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a standard resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The laptop’s display comes with a matte finish on top of it, which is quite handy for long-term usage. However, we felt that the display of this laptop was very dull with just average viewing angles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display.png" alt="Acer Aspire E15 (E5-575-33BM) - Display" width="600" height="390" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display.png 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display-300x195.png 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E15-Display-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Surprisingly, the laptop managed to score a very good, 143 percent in RGB colour ratio with the brightness measured around 190 nits, which is again sub par the segment considering the price. There is nothing much to really appreciate the screen quality on this laptop. On a lighter note, the display is just fine and will satisfy you if you&#8217;re a light user and doesn&#8217;t focus much on the screen detailing. Thankfully, the blacks on the screen were deep and evident.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The laptop as mentioned earlier comes with a long list of powerful specifications for the asking price. However, there are tonnes of other laptops out in the market with similar specifications. So what makes the Acer Aspire E15 unique? Well, it’s the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">latest seventh generation (Kabylake) Intel core i3 processor</span>, which is the show stopper for this laptop. Under the hood, the laptop comprises of a 2.4GHz intel i3 processor paired with a decent 4GB of RAM. The amount of RAM ensures decent multitasking on the laptop and is convenient for almost all the daily essentials.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with a massive 1TB of hard disk, which is another outstanding feature in the segment it falls in. The laptop comes with integrated Intel graphics for gaming and other graphics related aspects. Although the laptop is not primarily meant for gaming, the configuration it packs in is enough to run most of the decent games.</p>

<p>The Aspire E5-575-33BM laptop comes with an 8X DVD-Super Multi Double-Layer Drive for data retentions on CD/DVD. Moreover, the drive is enabled with M-DISC, which makes it, even more, easier to transfer content. The laptop also packs in an SD card slot, to read data directly from an SD card.</p>
<h4>Webcam</h4>
<p>The Acer Aspire E15 comes with an HD Webcam supporting a resolution of 1280 x 720 with High Dynamic Range (HDR).</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d like to describe the Acer Aspire E15&#8217;s webcam in two simple words— quite average. Photos taken in bright indoor conditions was decent enough, minus the fuzzy images at times. Thankfully, the colours seemed fairly accurate. The camera is fast and the average time to capture a frame is quite less. All-in-all the camera on the Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM laptop is quite manageable as it is quite enough for casual or professional video calls.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1">Ports &amp; Slots</h4>
<p>Speaking of the available ports on this laptop, it comes with a standard 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 port) for wired network connectivity. The laptop comes with a USB 3.1 Type-C lightning port for direct data transfers through a mobile or faster file transfers. In addition to that, the laptop also comes with a pair of USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port for connecting peripherals or for transferring storage mediums.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1607" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575G-33BM Ports" width="800" height="94" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports.jpg 800w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-300x35.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-768x90.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-610x72.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-600x71.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Acer-Aspire-E5-575G-53VG-Ports-50x6.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />For all other entertainment and multimedia based usages, the laptop comes with one HDMI port, with HDCP support.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop runs Windows 10 Home variant out of the box. Windows 10 needs no introduction in the field of laptops and is currently the leading computer OS across the globe. The software is pretty stable and we personally felt that the hardware on the laptop is pretty well configured with the OS. That said, we never felt a lag or any stuttering or hiccups in the software performance of the system.</p>

<p>In addition to all the advantages of Windows 10 such as app supports, Windows app stores, compatibility, productivity, and various others, it also comes with a set of Acer’s proprietary software such as Acer ExaColor, Skype for business and more.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Performance wise, the laptop is top-notch! thanks to the latest hardware packed beneath the hood the Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM delivers a very stable and efficient performance even under continuous usage. It is because of the seventh gen of intel core processors, the laptop is able to provide a reliable performance without getting heated much. Yes, the laptop stays cool even after 6-8 hours of continuous usage.</p>

<p>We used the laptop rigorously to stream Full HD and 4K videos, continuous browsing with around 15 tabs alive in Chrome, run benchmarking applications in the background, and listening to music simultaneously. The laptop to our surprise took all these tasks with ease and was delivering an uninterrupted performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM Laptop Review - Hardware" width="575" height="385" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware.jpg 575w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware-300x201.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware-210x140.jpg 210w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-Laptop-Review-Hardware-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" />As far as connectivity is concerned, we faced no issues in connecting to both wired and wireless networks. Dual-Band on the laptop works very fine and the laptop almost overtime latched onto the network in seconds when enabled. On a conclusive note, the laptop delivers an absolutely powerful performance at the price-point it is available and is surely superior to almost all its competitors in the segment.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, gaming on this laptop is quite ok. That said, since the laptop comes with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, the laptop delivers just average graphics rendering. Although the laptop was able to handle graphics intensive benchmarking applications and flash players with ease, it struggled to handle high-end games such as far cry and fallout 4.</p>

<p>If gaming is your primary requirement then this laptop is not for you. however, you can still play low-to-medium graphics enabled games on this laptop with ease.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire E15 E5-575-33BM laptop is touted to be one of the multimedia stationed laptop by the brand. I have expected some sort of outstanding performance in multimedia section due to the hype created by the company. Sadly, I was not impressed. Do note that the sound quality is still better than what you get at this price. But, in spite of the two built-in stereo speakers the audio output which we feel is a little low.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with the Acer’s proprietary TrueHarmony to deliver lifelike rich audio along with a custom equaliser. However, the laptop was able to play even 4K and Full HD content with ease. We did not notice any lag or frame drops while playing high-end video content. Watching movies and videos on the laptop will be fun, thanks to its really long lasting battery backup and matte finished display.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with a lithium ion removable 4-cell battery, which I believe is quite sufficient for a laptop this calibre. Accordingly, the laptop was managing to deliver about 8+ hours of battery backup, even after continuous usage. The laptop gets fully charged in 0 to 100 in just around 2 hours, which is great.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1896" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire E5-575-33BM 15.6 Inch Full HD Laptop - Battery" width="550" height="372" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery-300x203.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Acer-Aspire-E5-575-33BM-15.6-Inch-Full-HD-Laptop-Battery-50x34.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />In our video loop test, the laptop lasted for just under 9 hours of continuous playback which is a sign of positivity for all the multimedia enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Acer Aspire E15 ticks all the right boxes and is a perfect combination of hardware and software. All the powerful innards and the decent looking outer chassis make this laptop feel and perform better than most of its rival. If you&#8217;re a gaming lover, then probably this laptop is not for you. But let me remind you, if you need a gaming laptop at around $350, then this can be termed as a class-leading gaming performer as well! With all that said, you just can&#8217;t get any other better performing laptop at $330.</p>
