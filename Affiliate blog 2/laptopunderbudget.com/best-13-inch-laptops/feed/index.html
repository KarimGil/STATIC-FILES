					<description><![CDATA[My preference is to have a 8th gen i7 U series OR i5 H series processor. With this I want a 13.3 touchscreen detachable/convertible business laptop. I am confused which one is best.

Lenovo yoga review is not good on the hinge rotatability part otherwise Lenovo yoga is fitting my taste. Please suggest.]]></description>

If you need a touchscreen with full HD resolution display, then LG Gram 13 is the easy choice, as XPS 13 offers touchscreen with 4K display only and it&#039;s very costly. As far as color accuracy is concerned, LG Gram 13 is slightly ahead covering 128% of sRGB color gamut while XPS 13 covers 117%. Not a huge difference, but it does matter as you would be using it for editing photos. If you would be using your laptop outdoors or in highly lit areas, then Dell XPS 13 would be the better choice as its display is brighter at 372 nits than the LG Gram&#039;s 307 nits bright display. Both the laptops are very good overall, and despite these small differences, both are very good picks for photo editing and occasional video editing work.]]></description>
