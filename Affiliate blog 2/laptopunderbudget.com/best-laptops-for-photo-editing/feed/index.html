I think you should check out the 2018 Dell XPS 15. It has one of the best displays available on the laptops right now and it is powerful enough to handle all sorts of photo editing requirements.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
Thank you for such a detailed article. I found it so helpful. I just recently purchased a new MacBook Pro 15” fully loaded for top performance (photo editing, PS and Lightroom). I was loving it but quickly developed hand pain due to the design of the new keyboard and trackpad. I’m considering returning it and was wondering what laptop would you recommend. Budget is open... would like something fast with excellent display and able to handle photo editing. Hopefully something not too bulky.  It would have to be a windows model... it appears that Mac no longer sells the older bodies with the keyboard that I loved, much more comfortable.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks]]></description>

Hi Kristin,
If you&#039;re used to Mac then switching to a new MacBook will be definitely less work. However, switching to Windows also isn&#039;t that hard. If you use Photoshop then all the extensions and tools that you use in it on Mac are available for Windows as well. So, if you don&#039;t mind spending a little time in learning and adapting the Windows shortcuts for Photoshop then there are a lot of great Windows laptops suitable for photo editing. You can check out Dell XPS 13 or the newly launched Surface Laptop 2 or &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-6-matt-black-specs-insights-preorders/&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft Surface Pro 6 Matt Black Specs, Insights and Preorder Details&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Surface Pro 6&lt;/a&gt; if you like convertibles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Mike - your article is much appreciated. My 2009 Mac desktop finally truly bite the dust- manufacturing hardware issues with this model. I&#039;m finally considering a laptop and budget sorta under a $1000. I&#039;m a photographer and so used to working on a Mac, and not much of a tech person. I may have this wrong, but if I stay with a Mac won&#039;t it be easier to transfer and &quot;translate&quot; my established apps, software, etc. to the laptop? So used to working with a mouse, etc. Can you tell I have some &quot;Mac Anxiety&quot;? Anyway, display is paramount in working with images of course, and the storage/speed. I&#039;d appreciate your wisdom on this one. Thanks!]]></description>

Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/asus-vivobook-f510ua-ah51-laptop-review/&quot; title=&quot;ASUS VivoBook F510UA Full HD Laptop Review – Best Value for Money Laptop&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ASUS VivoBook F510UA&lt;/a&gt;. It is our most recommended laptop in $500 price-range right now. It has got the power to run photo editing software smoothly, but its display isn&#039;t a great fit for editing work. It lacks color accuracy and has bad viewing angles. Also, it does not come with a dedicated GPU and runs on the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics which is fine as long as you don&#039;t have to edit a very high resolution image.]]></description>
