This has complicated my budget and my next book release. So  I am in the market for a new laptop ASAP.]]></description>

Hi Laura, 
All the options are great for writing and personally I like keyboards on Lenovo ThinkPads. But, I am bit confused with my recommendation because you said you have oversize hands. I would recommend you to go to your nearest computer store (Best Buy, Walmart, etc.) and try typing on different laptop models there. Ask them to show the laptops with 8th generation Intel Core i3 or i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and SSD storage.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am thinking of writing a book of my life, only because it seems to be a little more interesting then most. I just started wearing glasses, and have or feel I have oversize hands. the Keyboard is my concern. Can you say these acer and Lenovo are good over the rest. I want to thank you for allowing us to read this and save us the worry. Thank you.]]></description>
