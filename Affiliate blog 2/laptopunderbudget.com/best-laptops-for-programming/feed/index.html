Hi Chrissie,
According to me, the MacBook Pro would be a better pick here. The processor on the MacBook Air is a current generation one, but it&#039;s slightly less powerful than the one on MacBook Pro. Being a computer science student myself, I know what kind of programs CS students have to use and having a better processor makes a huge difference in the compile time of large projects. So, definitely MacBook Pro will be my pick.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I am struggling to choose between the 2018 Macbook Air and the 2018 13 inch macbook pro without touch bar because they are very similar and fit all my basic needs despite the differences in processing power as the Pro seems better.  So which computer would you recommend would last the next 4 years of a Computer Science major?]]></description>

Hi,

I would recommend you to look at Dell&#039;s XPS series of laptops and also check out Lenovo ThinkPad T480. Both of these machines will be good fit for your requirements. You can find them both at their official web stores.]]></description>

Specs are pretty good for programming. I would recommend you to clean install Windows on it and still if you find it slow then go to HP service and tell them to replace the HDD with an SSD. That small upgrade will make it significantly faster.]]></description>

Hi,

I would recommend you to buy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-programming/#L2&quot;&gt;Acer Aspire E 15 laptop&lt;/a&gt;. The ASUS VivoBook S510UA is also good choice but it misses out on dedicated GPU. While your programming needs might not require the GPU power but having an entry level one from Nvidia or AMD is always good.]]></description>
