					<description><![CDATA[I am well equipped in my office but need a laptop or Chromebook (I don’t know which) for travel. All of my stuff for work is cloud based so I don’t need Microsoft. I literally just need it to access the Internet for (google, gmail, drive, etc). What do you recommend? All of these sound like they’d work but which is the best under $250?]]></description>

MacBook Air is enough for beginner-level editing work if you do it with patience. If you are looking for a Windows alternative to it, then Acer predator Helios 300 is excellent option. However, don&#039;t expect its battery to last for a long time. For around $700, there is HP Pavilion 15 and the MSI GV62 8RD gaming laptops. You will find them in our guide to buy the laptops under $700 &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-700-dollars/&quot; title=&quot;Top 10 Best Laptops Under $700&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mike, 

I&#039;m currently looking for a laptop around $700 for editing video and photo without any lag with a smooth rendering. What laptop would you recommend ? And, do you think that for a beginner MacBook Air is enough for editing video and photos?]]></description>

If you are planning to play less demanding games, then the Acer Aspire 5 is a great option that weighs less than 3 pounds. However, if you are looking for a laptop to run graphics intensive games then I would recommend you to spend a little extra and get the Acer Aspire E 15 as it comes with a dedicated Nvidia GPU.]]></description>
