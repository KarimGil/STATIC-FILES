If you want performance then you&#039;ll have to compromise in battery backup. You can either get a laptop with long battery life with less powerful hardware or get the powerful machine with less battery life. For under $1000, currently the best laptop for gaming is &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/#L1&quot;&gt;Dell Inspiron i7577&lt;/a&gt;. It offers best specs for gaming with GTX 1060 GPU.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I wonder which one of these laptops will be able to play the newest games for the next 10 to 15 years? Even though I will wait for price drops for the games.
Is the one with 7 hours of battery life the best one or the one with 15 hours? Could the one with 15 hours of battery life be able to play all the newest games at max settings? Or would the 7 hour one also be able to play the newest games? Acer Nitro 5 (with Quad-Core i5 and GTX 1050Ti) is the 7 hour one I am talking about, while the other is Acer Aspire E15 Gaming Laptop.]]></description>
