					<description><![CDATA[A couple of things this review left out was how easy it is to upgrade RAM memory.  You can go up to 32GB and it takes about 2mins to open the laptop  (without voiding the warranty!) Pop in the extra memory and done.

Also an M.2 ssd can be added just as fast.

The one thing I am disappointed in is the actual battery life I&#039;m experiencing. Even though I followed Acer&#039;s instructions for prepping the battery (fully charge before using. Run battery completely down and recharge &#038; repeat 3 times) I am still only seeing about 5hrs of actual battery life. Even if I use the battery saving mode!

All in all though, $349.00 for the laptop, $25 for the extra 4GB ram  $90 for the m.2 ssd for a total of $465 &#038; ima very happy camper!]]></description>
