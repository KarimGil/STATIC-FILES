										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The all-new Acer ConceptD laptops are what happens when Acer takes all of their expertise in creating gaming laptops and turns them into something designed specifically for video editors, illustrators, and creators, as well as to take on Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Apple has had a fairly sizable share of the creator market for years with their MacBook and MacBook Pro. However, it&#8217;s also no secret that more and more creators are starting to look towards cheaper, Windows alternatives. The market is already starting to respond, but there just aren&#8217;t that many alternatives yet. Consider the Acer ConceptD laptops as the latest and one of the best in the growing line of reasons why creators should switch over to Windows and eschew Apple starting today.</p>
<p>Acer announced their new brand, ConceptD, earlier on April 11, Thursday, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Acer ConceptD laptops will initially come in three variants, each designed to help position the company to give creators a viable Windows alternative to the MacBook Pro at various price points.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Acer ConceptD Laptops</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5481 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-ConceptD-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Acer ConceptD Laptops" width="1200" height="792" />The ConceptD 9 is the flagship of Acer&#8217;s latest line. Acer claims that they designed it specifically for drawing and 3D work. To this end, they equipped the Concept D 9 with a convertible 17-inch 4K display. Not only that, but the display is also Pantone validated and has a near-perfect &lt;1 Delta-E accuracy rating for maximum color accuracy. The display also uses the same Ezel Aero Hinge as that of the Predator Triton 900 and comes with built-in support for Wacom pen.</p>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0N4Y1-G1zU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Under the hood, the ConceptD 9 comes equipped with a latest ninth-generation Intel Core i9 CPU, an RTX 2080 GPU, as well as support for up 16GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage space. For modern accessibility, Acer equipped the ConceptD 9 with Thunderbolt 3, USB Type-C and DisplayPort 1.4 ports.</p>
<p>The ConceptD 9&#8217;s smaller brother, the ConceptD 7, is a bit smaller. It sports a 15.6-inch 4K display and &#8220;only&#8221; comes with up to a Core i7 processor. You can also choose to have it with an RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU or the RTX 2060. The ConceptD 7 also doesn&#8217;t have the same convertible screen as the flagship of the line, nor the same pen support. However, it does come with the same storage and RAM options, making it a more traditional and more affordable laptop alternative.</p>
<p>Finally, the ConceptD 5 is the least powerful of the three. It still has the same 15.6-inch 4K panel as that of the ConceptD 7. However, underneath, it&#8217;s a bit slower, albeit still capable, with 8th-Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors powering it, along with the AMD Radeon RX Vega M GPU. Both RAM, as well as storage options, are also limited for the ConceptD5 compared to the ConceptD 7 and Concept D9. But, if it&#8217;s any consolation, the Concept D5 is the smallest and lightest of all the Acer ConceptD laptops.</p>
<h3>When Are the Acer ConceptD Laptops Going to Release?</h3>
<p>The Acer ConceptD 5 and ConceptD 7 will start selling as early as later this month of April. The former will start selling at a $1,699 price point, while the latter will set users back at least $2,299. The more powerful Acer ConceptD 9 is not set to launch until later on in June. The flagship product of the new line will start selling at a $4,999 price point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Acer gaming laptops, specifically, the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7, will both receive hardware and design updates once their latest versions release later this year.</p>
<p>This was confirmed on Thursday, April 11, at the Acer Global Press Conference in New York.</p>
<p>The Nitro series line of gaming laptops are part of Acer&#8217;s effort to tap into the more budget-conscious side of the gaming laptop market. As per Acer General Manager of Notebooks, James Lin, the Nitro series Acer gaming laptops are proof that &#8220;performance gaming doesn&#8217;t need to break the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>True to that, the Acer Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 come at very affordable price points. However, they have an interesting set of features, both in terms of design and hardware. Even though there are slight compromises, the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 present themselves as budget-friendly alternatives with commendable specifications.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New in the 2019 Acer Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 Gaming Laptops?</h3>
<p>Of the two Acer gaming laptops, the Nitro 7 is more noteworthy.  It is actually a new product, not a revamp. It features a metal chassis, which belies its &#8220;affordable&#8221; nature and measures just 19.9mm thin. More importantly, it also comes equipped with a 15.6-inch Full HD display with a refresh rate of 144Hz and a 3ms response time.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Nitro 7 is aimed for hardcore gamers on the go. Specifically, it&#8217;s made for those who love playing FPS titles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Nitro 5 is the one that&#8217;s actually a refresh of the older line. It is also the cheaper of the two Acer gaming laptops. It comes with two types of displays. You can either choose a 15.6-inch display or a 17.3-inch display. Regardless, both will come with an increased screen-to-body ratio of 80 percent. This means that the display bezels of the new Nitro 5 (as well as that of the Nitro 7) are a lot narrower compared to the older versions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5468 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acer-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" />Outside of the fact that both Acer gaming laptops come available with up to 9th-generation Intel Core processors and the latest Nvidia graphics cards, other important features include expansive storage options, including a dedicated HDD slot and two M.2 SSD slots, as well as support for up to 32GB DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>Both the Nitro 5 and Nitro 7 will also come with the &#8220;CoolBoost&#8221; feature, a dual-fan cooling design that allows the laptops to keep temperatures low during intense gaming sessions. Both also feature a Killer Ethernet E2500 networking card. Additionally, you can also use the Network Optimizer Tool by Acer to further minimize latency issues when gaming online.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to the Acer Predator Helios 700</h3>
<p><iframe width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgWq9jsmNiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The creme of the crop when it comes to Acer gaming laptops, the latest Acer Predator Helios 700 puts the Taiwan-based manufacturer right at the forefront of risque innovations in the high-end, desktop-replacement, gaming laptop niche.</p>
<p>As expected, the top of the line Acer Predator Helios 700 will feature high-end hardware components. This includes an overclockable 9th-gen Intel Core i9 CPU, as well as the regular Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU and not the toned down Max-Q version, as well as support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, however.</p>
<p>The Acer Predator Helios 700 also features a transforming keyboard and trackpad that you can slide forward to help improve ventilation, which can come in quite handy if you&#8217;re trying to squeeze even more performance out of the Acer Predator Helios 700 by overclocking its hardware. The said keyboard also comes packed with MagForce keys, as well as linear switches, in addition to the requisite RGB lighting. This helps create an optimal typing and gaming experience.</p>
<p>For those who think that the Acer Predator Helios 700 is a bit too much, the smaller Acer Predator Helios 300 is also available. The latest version retains the look of its predecessor, but it comes with improved internals.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;#1 gaming notebook&#8221; comes equipped with a 144Hz display that has a 3ms response time. It can come up with up to an RTX 2080 GPU, a 9th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU, as well as 32GB of DDR4 RAM.</p>
<h3>When Are the New Acer Gaming Laptops Going to be Available?</h3>
<p>For those interested, it is already possible to buy the Acer Nitro 7 in the United States. It starts selling at a $1,000 price point. Acer plans on shipping Nitro 7 units out to the China and EMEA regions sometime in May and June. Meanwhile, for the Acer Nitro 5, it will arrive in US shores starting later this month of April. It will start selling for $800. The Nitro 5 should start making an appearance in the China and EMEA regions in May 2019.</p>
<p>As for the Acer Predator Helios 700, it will start selling at a $2,699 price point. The smaller Acer Predator Helios 300 is a bit more affordable at $1,199. Both should be available in April in the United States. However, the Acer Predator Helios 300 will only start selling in Europe in June, with the Helios 700 coming later in July.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where most manufacturers use the Mobile World Congress as a platform to announce their latest mobile gadgets, Lenovo used MWC 2019 to announce their latest line of refreshed ThinkPad T Series and X series laptop, set to release in June later this year.</p>
<p>Easily the most well-known and popular of their ThinkPad line of laptops, the latest refreshes all share one trait in common — all of them will be equipped with the latest Intel Whiskey Lake processors.</p>
<h2>Say Hello to the Refreshed ThinkPad T Series Laptops</h2>
<p>The headliner of the latest refreshed T Series laptops is the Lenovo ThinkPad T490s.</p>
<p>Released as the successor to the widely popular Lenovo Thinkpad T480s, the T490s sports a thinner chassis at 0.63-inches over the T480s&#8217; 0.72-inch chassis. Also, it can come equipped with up to a super bright 500-nit HDR screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution. An option to have slightly less brighter 400-nit, 1920 x 1080 display is also available for those who are willing to sacrifice aesthetics for a longer battery life. Both versions of the T490s&#8217; 14-inch screen will come with a PrivacyGuard panel to help hide the content of your screen from prying eyes.</p>
<p>Specs-wise, the T490s can come with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD, 32GB of DDR4 ram, and a battery expected to last up to 20 hours unplugged.</p>
<div id="attachment_5331" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-image-5331 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Refreshed-T400-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Refreshed T400 Laptops" width="1200" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5331" class="wp-caption-text"><i>Image &#8211; Lenovo</i></p></div>
<p>Next up is the entry-level ThinkPad T490, the follow-up to the ThinkPad T480. It has a much-thinner bezel compared to its predecessor and comes with the same set of privacy features as the T490s, as well as an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card upgrade and the same 500-nit, 2560 x 1440 resolution HDR display.</p>
<p>Finally, their bulkiest and biggest of them all, the T590 will use the additional real estate to over a high-res 4K display, complete with 500 nits of brightness and Dolby Vision color.</p>
<p>Similar to the T490, the T590 can come equipped with an optional Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card. It will also feature the new single-battery RapidCharge technology by Lenovo and will be nearly half a pound lighter compared to the 4.29-pound ThinkPad T580 at just 3.87 pounds.</p>
<h2>Expected Released Date of the Refreshed ThinkPad Laptops</h2>
<p>All three of the refreshed T Series laptops will arrive sometime in June in the United States. However, those in Europe can have their hands on the T490 and the T590 as early as this March; the T490s will arrive in Europe in April.</p>
<p>As for the pricing, the T490 is the cheapest of the bunch with a starting price point of $999. The T590 is next at $1,029, followed by the T490s at $1,279.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP is making the move to the red team, releasing two new AMD-Powered HP ProBook models, the 445 G6 and the 455 G6.</p>
<p>Aimed towards small businesses and start-ups alike, both models will feature exclusively Ryzen and Ryzen Pro APUs. But, because the HP ProBook is a business-grade laptop, you&#8217;ll see multiple features that you normally wouldn&#8217;t see in conventional laptops. This includes improved security features, better durability, longer battery life, and an ultra-thin design that&#8217;s all complemented by relatively low asking price.</p>
<h2>The New and Improved AMD-Powered HP ProBook</h2>
<p>For all the flack that AMD has received over the past few years, they have slowly been delivering in the laptop side of things. HP&#8217;s latest decision to arm the HP ProBook should help serve as validation for the once-struggling Intel rival.</p>
<p>Built for the growing business owner, the HP ProBook 445 and 455 will sport a full-aluminum chassis as well as the latest in AMD technology. Both can come with up to an AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 2700 APU, which also comes with a Radeon RX Vega 10 GPU, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and plenty of storage with up to a 512GB SSD.</p>
<p>Being that these were made to stand a beating, the newest HP ProBooks passed MIL-STD 810G standard testing and comes equipped with a spill-resistant keyboard.</p>
<p>Finally, at just 0.71-0.75 inches thin, the neat and compact design, paired with its respectable specifications (especially for the price) and batteries rated to last for nearly 12 hours on a single charge, should easily make this business laptop a favorite. Albeit, not for anything remotely close to graphic design. With a screen that emits only over 220 nits of brightness and just over 67 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the display is subpar, to say the least. It also certainly doesn&#8217;t help that the bezels on the screen are a bit thicker.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>HP confirmed that they plan to launch the the sixth-generation of the HP ProBook sometime later in January at a starting price point of $549.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Gigabyte gaming laptops garnered a lot of attention at CES 2019, and it&#8217;s not only because the Aorus 15 and Aero 15 are both set to receive noteworthy hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>Released in collaboration with Microsoft, the new Gigabyte gaming laptops will feature the Microsoft Azure AI. This industry-first artificial intelligence was programmed to fully optimize the laptop&#8217;s performance based on the user&#8217;s previous pattern of use.</p>
<h2>Gigabyte Gives the Aorus 15 a Price Cut and a Modest Spec Bump</h2>
<p>Compared to its more expensive predecessors, the Aorus 15 will be priced relatively cheaper, putting it firmly within the mainstream range. However, make no mistake, this laptop retains the same premium aesthetics and performance &#8212; just without the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>Featuring the Microsoft Azure AI, where if enabled, will pull data from previously stored information on the software that you&#8217;re currently using and will optimize everything necessary for ideal performance, whether you&#8217;re playing video games or processing media.</p>
<div id="attachment_5190" style="width: 725px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5190" class=" wp-image-5190" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aorus-15-with-RTX.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aorus 15 with RTX GPUs and Microsoft Azure AI" width="715" height="418" /><p id="caption-attachment-5190" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>At its most expensive configuration, users can opt to equip the Aorus 15 with the latest Intel Core i7-8750H processor; an Nvidia RTX 2070 GPU; 16GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 32GB); and finally, two 2TB of fast SSD storage to give you all of the space that you could possibly ever need.</p>
<p>Weighing at just over 5 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Aorus 15 is not the sleekest nor the lightest gaming laptop. However, it is beautiful. In particular, half of the &#8220;under chassis&#8221; is full of heat pipes and fans. This gives the laptop a premium look, more akin to that of a luxury sports car&#8217;s engine.</p>
<p>Other features include a 15.6-inch Full HD panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, a three-zone RGB lighting keyboard, Windows precision drivers for the touchpad, as well as the NAHIMIC audio software for a truly immersive gaming experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500</a></strong></p>
<h2>The Gigabyte Aero 15 Is One of the Smartest Gaming Laptops Around</h2>
<p>Specced out to its maximum configuration, the Aero 15 will come equipped with the Intel Core i9-8950HK; a top-of-the-line Nvidia GTX 2080 MAX-Q GPU; 32GB of DDR4 RAM (with support for up to 64GB); and two 2TB SSDs to satisfy all of your storage needs.</p>
<p>Lighter and slimmer compared to the Aorus 15, the Aero 15 weighs just shy of 5 pounds. It&#8217;s also markedly thinner at just 0.74 inches thick. To match the svelte nature of the laptop, Gigabyte equipped the Aero 15 with a 15.6-inch display with ultra thin bezels. Users can choose to configure the monitor to come at 3840 x 2160 resolution (or 4K), and cover a whopping 100% of the Adobe RGB spectrum for maximum eye candy.</p>
<div id="attachment_5191" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5191" class="size-full wp-image-5191" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gigabyte-Aero-15-2019-with-RTX-and-Azure-AI.jpg" alt="Gigabyte Aero 15 2019 with RTX GPU and Azure AI" width="497" height="550" /><p id="caption-attachment-5191" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Gigabyte</p></div>
<p>Speaking of eye candy, users can customize each key on the keyboard. The Aero 15 comes decked out with a fully customizable RGB keyboard.</p>
<p>Of course, similar to its thicker and bulkier cousin, the Aero 15 will also feature the industry-first Microsoft Azure AI. This means, from the CPU and GPU to the RGB backlit keyboard, fans, and even sound effect settings, the software can optimize everything to fit user preferences and all users have to do is to press a single button.</p>
<p>The Gigabyte Aero 15 will also come with other notable features. This includes the long-awaited Windows precision drivers for the touchpad; 7.1 virtual surround sound courtesy of NAHIMIC 3; and batteries that Gigabyte claim can last up to 10 hours on a single charge.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Excited customers won&#8217;t have to wait long to get their hands on the AI-powered Gigabyte gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Both Gigabyte gaming laptops will start shipping at the end of January. The Aorus 15 will start at a more affordable price point of $1,799. Meanwhile, the Aero 15 will start selling for $2,299. The Aero 15 is also available at a discounted price of $2,199 for those who buy two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Dell&#8217;s subsidiary, Alienware, was focused on making headlines, Dell decided to appeal more to the mass consumer at CES 2019, announcing a refresh to their budget-friendly G series gaming laptops.</p>
<p>The next-generation laptops, the Dell G5 15, G7 15 and G7 17, are set to receive upgrades to both its internal components and aesthetics, with the more affordable line of gaming laptops starting to look more like their Alienware cousins.</p>
<h2>Affordability and Power Packed In a 15-inch Chassis</h2>
<div id="attachment_5155" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-image-5155 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5155" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>Where most refreshes only touch up on the hardware side of things, Dell also changed up the aesthetics of their G series gaming laptops for 2019. Instead of their more subtle look, they&#8217;re starting to look more like <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/alienware-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware laptops</a>. Case in point, by default, the Dell G7 15 and G5 15 will both come in Deep Space Black color options, decked out with blue-colored accents. Finally, rounding out its look are ridges located right around the border, which Dell presumably put both for aesthetic and functional purposes.</p>
<p>Another laptop, the Dell G5 15 SE, is also available as an upgrade. It features the same specs as the Dell G5 15. However, it comes with an Alpine White chassis and a clear panel on the bottom of the system that showcases the cooling system, which Dell equipped with blue fans.</p>
<p>The key difference between the G5 15 and the G7 15 is that the latter is thinner and weighs less. At just 0.78 inches and 5.77 pounds, the Dell G7 15 has slightly different dimensions compared to the Dell G5 15, which tips the scales at 6.1 pounds and is at least 0.95 inches thick.</p>
<p>Both of these G series gaming laptops come packing with the latest Quad- and Hex-core Cofee Lake Intel processors, as well as mobile versions of NVIDIA&#8217;s RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can opt to upgrade the display of the latest G series gaming laptops. For more eye candy, users can choose a 4K UHD, OLED display. Meanwhile, for serious and competitive gamers, the G5 15 and the G7 15 comes with a 144Hz Full HD display panel as well.</p>
<h2>An Inexpensive i9-Powered, 17-inch Laptop That Packs a Wallop</h2>
<div id="attachment_5156" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-image-5156 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Series-Gaming-Laptops-3.jpg" alt="G Series Gaming Laptops" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5156" class="wp-caption-text">Image &#8211; Dell</p></div>
<p>From the more budget friendly G series gaming laptops, we go to the slightly more expensive, but still affordable, G7 17.</p>
<p>Weighing at 7.21 pounds and nearly 1-inch thick, the Dell G7 17 is slightly bigger than its 15-inch brothers. Yet, at the same time, it&#8217;s also leaner compared to <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other 17-inch gaming laptops</a>. It also comes with the same Deep Space Black theme as its 15-inch varieties, and unfortunately, won&#8217;t be available in Alpine White.</p>
<p>Powered by the latest Intel Core i9 processor, the G7 17 is dramatically more powerful and faster compared to the G5 15 and the G7 15. However, other specifications, including the NVIDIA RTX graphics cards, which tops out with the RTX 2080, remains the same across all three (or four including the G5 15 SE) gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Dell has limited the 17-inch laptop to a Full HD display. However, users can choose to have it equipped with a 144Hz screen for a smoother gameplay experience.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Dell announced that all of the refreshed G series gaming laptops will start shipping on January 21.</p>
<p>The Dell G5 15 will start at $999, with the thinner and lighter Dell G7 15 starting at $1,099, and the Alpine White Dell G5 15 SE being available as an upgrade option. Finally, the Dell G7 17 will start at a $1,379 price point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eyebrow-raising and potentially, industry-shaking, Dell&#8217;s gaming-focused division, Alienware, turned a lot of heads at CES 2019 with their unveiling of the Alienware Area 51m.</p>
<p>Alienware, quite literally, released a desktop in laptop form at CES 2019. The Alienware Area 51m is a maxed out gaming laptop that comes with a fully upgradeable CPU and GPU. Yes, you read that right. You&#8217;ll be able to upgrade the laptop&#8217;s already impressive hardware down the line when you feel like it.</p>
<p>Just as when other manufacturers were looking at making their laptops thinner and thinner, Dell and Alienware took a decidedly different, but welcome, route.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s New with the Alienware Area 51m</h2>
<p>Dell claims that the Alienware Area 51m is the most powerful gaming laptop in the world right now. It comes with various configuration options. However, at its best, users can fit the Alienware Area 51m with a class-leading Intel Core i9-9900k CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. But, it&#8217;s not just the hardware that makes the desktop-turned-laptop stand out. It&#8217;s also what you can do with the insides of the gaming laptop down the line that makes it unique.</p>
<p>Alienware decided to revisit an idea from one of their former products with the Alienware Area 51m and have made the gaming laptop fully upgradeable. This means that users can upgrade its graphics card and processor in the future. Of course, as expected, users can also upgrade both the storage and the memory (up to 64GB of RAM). This gives the Alienware Area 51m long-term viability.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, though. A potential problem is that users can only source the swappable &#8220;Dell Graphics Form Factor&#8221;, otherwise known as DGFF, graphics cards, from a limited choice of suppliers.</p>
<div id="attachment_5135" style="width: 1120px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5135" class="wp-image-5135 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Alienware-Area-51m-2.jpg" alt="Alienware Area 51m" width="1110" height="460" /><p id="caption-attachment-5135" class="wp-caption-text">The all-new Alienware Area 51m gaming laptop</p></div>
<p>Aesthetically, the Alienware Area 51m certainly isn&#8217;t the sleekest gaming laptop around. The 17-inch chassis, equipped with a 17.3-inch panel, is huge, to say the least. Just like the hardware, the screen is available in various configurations. This includes a 60Hz display; a 60Hz display with G-Sync; a 144Hz with Tobii eye tracking; a 144Hz display with G-sync, and finally, a 144Hz display with both G-Sync and Tobii eye tracking.</p>

<p>Weighing in at just 8.53 pounds, the Alienware Area 51m is surprisingly not that heavy.</p>
<p>Other specifications include a multi-colored keyboard, power on tap, a huge <span class="st">90Wh battery, </span>and a hefty cooling system.</p>
<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Alienware failed to provide any details regarding which models the introduction price will cover. However, they did go on to announce that they will ship out the Alienware Area 51m starting at the end of the month (January). Prices will start at a whopping, but understandable, $2,549.</p>
<p>Alienware also added that they will start shipping out more affordable configurations of the Alienware Area 51m later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to be outdone, Lenovo unveiled a lot at CES 2019, including a refresh of their Legion gaming laptops.</p>
<p>Taking center stage to unveil their new Legion Y740 (17-inch and 15-inch) and Y540 (15-inch) models, which are both refreshes of the Y730 and Y530 gaming laptops that they released last year, Lenovo&#8217;s latest line of gaming laptops will both be equipped with the latest Intel 8th Gen Processors and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.</p>
<h2 class="speakableTextP1">What&#8217;s New with the Legion Gaming Laptops?</h2>
<p>For the Legion Y740, users can opt for various configurations per unit. This includes the option to have up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM installed, as well as either a 15-inch or a 17-inch display with optional 144Hz refresh rate and NVIDIA G-SYNC support. Both device sizes will also come equipped with beautiful RGB backlit keys powered by the iCUE software by Corsair; support for Dolby Vision HDR software for ultra-vivid picture quality; a significantly brighter screen at up to 500 nits; and finally, a Dolby Atmos Speaker System with Dolby Sound Radar for improved audio quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while both devices can come with either the Intel Core i5-8300H or Intel Core i7-8750H, only the 17-inch model can come equipped with the latest the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU, while the 15-inch model will have to &#8220;settle&#8221; with the NVIDIA RTX 2070 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<div id="attachment_5107" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-image-5107 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Legion-Gaming-Laptops-2.jpg" alt="Legion Gaming Laptops" width="900" height="549" /><p id="caption-attachment-5107" class="wp-caption-text">The Lenovo Legion Y740</p></div>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, the more affordable 15-inch gaming laptop won&#8217;t lag too far behind its bigger siblings in terms of specs. It will come equipped with a yet unannounced Intel Core processor and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2060 GPU. Also, at only 5.1 pounds, what the Y540 lacks in power, it makes up for with portability. Lenovo also equipped the Y540 with Harman Kardon speakers and support for Dolby Atmos for an immersive gaming experience, as well as a white backlit keyboard with a response time of under 1ms.</p>
<p>Other important notable features available across all models include support for various storage options (512GB PCIe SSD, 512GB SATA SSD, and a 2TB SATA HDD), a better cooling system, longer battery life, and an improved aluminum display hinge for added monitor stability.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Lenovo plans to make their latest line of Legion gaming laptops available later this year.</p>
<p>Lenovo will begin shipping out the 15-inch and 17-inch Legion Y740 laptops first in February. The 15-inch model will start at $1,749.99 and the 17-inch model will start at $1,979.99.</p>
<p>As for the Legion Y540, Lenovo will start shipping the lower-specced laptops out in May starting at $929.99.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2019, Razer announced an updated Razer Blade 15 gaming laptop, including an &#8220;Advanced Model&#8221; that comes with a 144Hz Full HD display and up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU.</p>
<h3>Better, and More Powerful, the Updated Razer Blade 15</h3>
<p>Given the cult-like following Razer has amassed throughout the years, any product the Singapore-based gaming company releases needs very little introduction. These things pretty much hype themselves up. This includes the Razer Blade 15, which according to Razer&#8217;s announcement at CES 2019, is going to receive a nice spec upgrade.</p>
<p>For the updated Razer Blade 15, Razer decided to stick to the same dimensions and aesthetics as last year. However, the refresh is anything but on the inside. The new Razer Blade 15 will come with modest but noticeable changes under the hood. For starters, it can now come equipped with up to an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Max-Q GPU. However, the other specs will remain the same with last year&#8217;s model, including the 144Hz Full HD display.</p>
<p>At its highest configuration, you&#8217;re getting an eighth-generation Intel Core i7-8750H, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and up to 512GB of fast SSD storage. This is in addition to the aforementioned NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. The entry-level model, which comes with the last-gen GPU, the NVIDIA GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU, will continue to remain on sale.</p>

<p>Razer also delighted a lot of their fans at CES 2019 with another announcement; they announced that they will be updating the widely successful <a title="Razer Blade 15 Gets Affordable Base Model and New White Color Option" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/razer-blade-15-gets-affordable-model-new-white-color-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury White edition of the Razer Blade 15</a>. The updated Razer Blade 15 Mercury White edition will now be available with either the NVIDIA RTX 2060 or the NVIDIA RTX 2070 MAX-Q GPU. Razer plans to make both configurations available for purchase online at Razer.com. However, the latter will also be made available exclusively at Best Buy.</p>
<h3>More Potential Features Down the Line</h3>
<p>Razer also showcased two potential new display technologies that could come to the Razer Blade 15 in the future.</p>
<p>The first is a 240Hz Full HD Display for an even more fluid gaming experience. Meanwhile, the second is a 4K OLED touch display that blends amazing color reproduction and efficient performance. But, that&#8217;s not all. Aside from showcasing the potential upgrades to the Razer Blade 15, Razer also announced that all the Advanced Models of the updated Razer Blade 15 will have their displays calibrated individually. Razer explains that this is to ensure &#8220;amazing color accuracy out of the box.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MSI are the latest in the long line of gaming laptop manufacturers to unveil their newest and latest RTX gaming laptops at CES 2019.</p>
<p>For 2019, MSI will usher in three new RTX gaming laptops into the market: the GS75 Stealth laptop, the PS63 Modern laptop, and the GE75 Raider laptop.</p>
<p>Each gaming laptop in their latest lineup is aimed towards catering to a specific target audience, but all three are made to help reaffirm MSI&#8217;s &#8220;position as an industry leader endorsed by gamers and eSports teams worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside their RTX gaming laptops, MSI also used CES 2019 to announce several of their latest products as well. This includes a new pre-built desktop, a new desktop case, a new gaming keyboard, and their newest line of high-performance graphics cards, spearheaded by the MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GAMING X TRIO.</p>
<h3>Say Hello to MSI&#8217;s RTX Gaming Laptops</h3>
<p>Leading the charge for MSI&#8217;s newest RTX gaming laptops is the MSI GS75 Stealth laptop. Coming in at just 0.75 inches thick and sporting a thin bezel design, all housed in an aluminum alloy body for a premium look, the GS75 is meant to stand out aesthetically. Specs-wise, the GS75 doesn&#8217;t lag behind its competition either. It comes with a huge 17.3-inch 144Hz IPS-level display, the latest Intel Core i7 series CPUs, and perhaps more importantly, the NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU.</p>
<div id="attachment_5094" style="width: 588px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-image-5094 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MSI-GS75-Stealth-17-inch-Thin-and-Light-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GS75 Stealth 17 inch Thin and Light Gaming Laptop" width="578" height="408" /><p id="caption-attachment-5094" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>MSI GS75 Stealth</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The GS75&#8217;s smaller brother, the GS65, is also receiving an update for the new year as well. The newest version of the 15.6-inch gaming laptop that weighs just 4.19 pounds will include the best and latest CPUs and GPUs the market has to offer.</p>

<p>Next up is the PS63 Modern. A laptop built for another market entirely, it is not the same beast of a gaming laptop that the GS75 is. At just 0.63 inches thick and 3.53 pounds, the PS63 Modern is perfect for content creators who are looking for a lightweight laptop that can doesn&#8217;t lag behind in terms of performance. It comes equipped with up to an Intel Core i7 processor and up to an NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU. More importantly, it has a 16-hour battery life and MSI&#8217;s own proprietary software called the &#8220;Creator Center&#8221; aimed specifically towards people who use creator software frequently.</p>
<p>Last, but definitely not the least, is the GE75 Raider gaming laptop. Much like the GS75, it comes equipped with the latest NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. However, different from the GS75, the GE75 will feature a thicker, more gamerish aesthetic, complete with a reflective diamond cut trim and a red anodized finish for a more aggressive look.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Availability</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, MSI didn&#8217;t unveil any details regarding when the general public will have a chance to get their hands on their latest RTX gaming laptops. However, many expect the Taiwan-based company to release more information regarding about the pricing and the availability of their RTX gaming laptops pretty soon.</p>
