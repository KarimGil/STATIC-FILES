										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently published a <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to buy the best 11 inch laptops</a>, where I elaborated the significance of having an ultraportable 11 inch laptop and the best ones you can opt, that are available in the market right now. But what about the other possibilities? What about the users who just can&#8217;t cope with a small&nbsp;display no matter how portable or lightweight the laptop might be? Or for users who want to settle on the middle ground and go for a midrange laptop? For those users here is a complete&nbsp;guide to buy the best 14 inch laptops which will help you to decide, why you should opt for a&nbsp;14 inch laptop over 13 and 15 inch ones and it also includes our&nbsp;10 of the most recommended 14 inch laptops which our team of laptop experts cherry-picked from all&nbsp;available in the market.</p>
<p><span id="more-2331"></span></p>
<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s get started&#8230;</p>
<div class="vc_message_box vc_message_box-standard vc_message_box-rounded vc_color-info">
	<div class="vc_message_box-icon"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Why a&nbsp;14 inch laptop is&nbsp;better than 13 and 15 inch laptops?</h3>
<p>It is always beneficial to explore opportunities from every perspective when it comes to investing in a comprehensive laptop&nbsp;for your daily requirements. Be it processing speed, a grade-A display or the perfect size for your taste. The&nbsp;14 inch laptop&nbsp;is considered to be a standard, average sized contrivance. But why you should&nbsp;go with&nbsp;the&nbsp;midsize laptop?</p>
<p>OK, so browsing through the different&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;models, there is a clear distinction between 13, 14 and 15 inch laptops. While ‘just an inch’ may sound insignificant but once you utilize each of them in your daily routine, the size variation would not go <strong>unnoticed</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, consider typing on a 13 inch and a 15 inch laptop. According to several feedbacks from users who have experience in using both, state that they often find keys crammed up a bit in a <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2019" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13 inch laptops</a>&nbsp;and due to its overall compact size, there is little space to rest your hands during long typing jobs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2334 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Keyboard-of-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="14 Inch Laptop Keyboard Comparison with Keyboard of MacBook Pro 13 Inch Laptop" width="738" height="600">For the 15-inch laptop, the keys are smaller in size, and there&#8217;s also an oddly placed trackpad which provides very less space to rest the left hand. Both of these issues can be problematic if you have big hands. There is also the uneven spacing between keys. Some keys are placed very close to each other while some have more space between them which makes typing a bit uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5270 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Keyboard-of-Dell-Inspiron-5570-15-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="14 Inch Laptop Keyboard Comparison with Keyboard of Dell Inspiron 5000 15 Inch Laptop" width="861" height="607"></p>
<p>A 14 inch laptop falls right in the middle of this dilemma and its&nbsp;industrial design provides neither too much nor too less spacing. Hence,&nbsp;a standard keyboard fits much better in a 14-inch chassis.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Another reason to prefer a 14 inch laptop or bigger over a 13 inch one is that they are known to provide better gaming performances. The smaller the laptop, the smaller will be its hardware bits and essentials, which means a <strong>diminutive battery</strong>, reduced stand up power, and not to mention a tiny keyboard that gets in the way of extreme gaming.</p>
<p>That said, there are hardly any<strong> &#8220;13 inch gaming laptops&#8221;</strong> available to buy in the market right now. The only 13 inch laptop that provided decent specs for gaming was <a title="Alienware 13" href="http://amzn.to/2okpWYe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alienware 13</a>, which is discontinued now, but it was a great laptop with powerful specs and mobility of a small laptop.</p>

<p>On the other hand,&nbsp;there are several 15 and even <strong>14 inch&nbsp;laptops housing dedicated Nvidia GPUs</strong> and are capable of seamlessly hosting several gaming titles in Full HD&nbsp;resolution. Though a 15 inch laptop&nbsp;might be a little too large for some folks to carry and move around, that’s why I’d recommend a 14 inch laptop that perfectly compensates the two contradictory scenarios I mentioned above.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>If you can&#8217;t easily move your computer, why are you buying a laptop in the first place?</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to laptops falling in the mid-size category, they are found to be the most flexible ones we can come around. Large enough to be accommodated at a work desk and small enough to be carried around in a rucksack. 14 inch&nbsp;laptops are considered to be an optimal size for <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2019 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">students</a>, <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gamers</a> and binge watchers as it has a fairly large screen, enough to provide high-quality streaming and resolution while maintaining its trimness.</p>
</div>

<p>So, now you might be ready to make an informed purchase&nbsp;of the 14 inch laptop for yourself?</p>
<p><em>If yes&#8230;</em></p>
<p>&#8230;here we&nbsp;have sorted a list of best 14-inch laptops available in different price ranges&nbsp;for you to consider and have briefly described their pros and cons that might help you assess which one fits best for your use.</p>
<p>Some of you may be looking for hi-tech processing characteristics, while some of you might base your decision on integrated graphics, so I’ll be roughly covering all aspects. Here are our most recommended best 14-inch compact ultrabooks of&nbsp;2019 to help you buy the best laptop within your budget.</p>

<p>This laptop is for people wanting a cheap, but at the same time, a fancy looking laptop. This economical windows 10 laptop comes with a sharp HD screen, an adequately powerful AMD A4-9120E processor and among its distinctly appreciable pros is the wide selection of I/O ports.</p>
<p>Considering its sleek and elegant chassis, it houses room for an HDMI port, a headset jack, an SD card reader, a USB 2.0 port, and a USB 3.0 port along with fast 802.11a/c Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless connectivity.</p>
<p>As for its processing power, it is a good choice for users who need laptop for casual video browsing and document manipulation. So its affordable rates and lightweight makes it a perfect fit for college students as its small enough to be carried in a backpack. The HP Stream 14 runs on Windows 10 Home in S mode so it can also be a good fit for extreme Windows fanatics, who want the panache of a Chromebook without having to rely on a browser based &#8220;chromebooks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only drawback that can be considered is, its limited 64GB storage and it is slightly heavier than its fellow Chromebook models, but that&#8217;s the case with almost all the&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheap laptops in 200 dollars price range</a>, so to get more storage, either you&#8217;ll have to increase your budget or settle with using the cloud storage or an external hard drive. Other than these, the HP Stream 14 laptop could check a lot of positive aspects on your assessment list including an inexpensive windows laptop, stylish chassis, and a 14 inch HD LED display.</p>

<h3 id="L2">2. ASUS Chromebook C425</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/36t1daz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5776 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ASUS-Chromebook-C425-14-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook C425 - best 14 inch chromebook" width="550" height="378"></a></p>
<p>By the looks of it, the Asus Chromebook C425 fits perfectly into the description of a steep, professional, hi-tech and stylish <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2oDmGMO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Air</a>, but instead of draining your bank account, the ASUS Chromebook costs only a few hundred bucks.</p>
<p>The chassis is exceptionally well designed with razor blade edges, rounded corners, an aluminum body and within its metallic frame, there is an Intel Core M3 dual-core processor, a 14 inch full HD IPS touchscreen display and a strong battery that offers a whopping 10-12 hours of backup!</p>
<p>Its processing capabilities, however, may not be considered as one of its strong suits. You might face a bit of lagging and stuttering if you burden its processor with several running web apps or multiple tab operations. However, it&#8217;s still decent for casual users. Moreover, the new Chromebook C425 also gets a microSD card reader which was missing on its predecessor, and it has also got the standard USB 3.1 port and 2 x USB Type-C ports one of which supports charging.</p>
<p>All in all, the laptop&nbsp;offers&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good value for the money</a>, and you won’t be able to get a laptop of this size, design and battery life at a better price. That said, the Asus Chromebook C425 is a nice 14-inch Chromebook for basic work tasks and to sit at your countertop for light browsing and streaming.</p>

<p>With an Acer Aspire 1, you can gladly leave your charger in your drawer and go out for a full workday. Alongside a long-lasting battery, the Acer Aspire 1 comes preinstalled with a Windows 10 OS, and it has a bright full HD 14 inch display, which is a rare-scene at this price point.</p>
<p>The exterior has a classy looking brushed aluminum like finish that makes it appear way more premium than it costs. Another commendable feature is, it comes with long list of ports including HDMI, USB 3.0 and a <strong>Ethernet</strong> port, which is&nbsp;very rare in the <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops falling under sub-$300 category</a>.</p>
<p>For users on a budget, looking for an ultraportable, stylish laptop and are usually on the road, the Acer Aspire 1 is a fair bargain. The 2.6GHz Intel Celeron N4100 processor suffices for basic everyday operations without causing much of a problem. From performance point of view, it offers matchable power to its rivals and clearly outshines among ultraportable, budget laptops. Acer Aspire 1 also hosts an SD card reader to extend its 64GB storage and it comes with 4GB of RAM which is more than enough to help you get through your daily work routine, or light document drafting.</p>
<p>As long as you stick to casual browsing and video streaming, you’d be more than happy with this 14 inch laptop&#8217;s&nbsp;battery life and performance.</p>

<h3 id="L4">4. Lenovo Ideapad S340 14&#8243; Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://lenovo.vzew.net/a95vo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5714 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lenovo-Ideapad-S340-14-inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Lenovo Ideapad S340 - best 14 inch laptops" width="550" height="466"></a></p>
<p>The ‘S’ in S340 stands for ’Slim’, and among the Lenovo 300 series, this particular model is the sleekest, most premium designed and it also happens to be the cheapest amidst its peers as well.</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;<a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $600" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-600-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price tag of around $600</a>, this well-built laptop&nbsp;has been designed by paying peculiar attention to detail, and its ergonomically designed keyboard along with <strong>14-inch slim bezel screen</strong> are perfect examples of it.</p>
<p>With its minimalistic exterior, this slim laptop contains an Intel Core i5-1035G1 processor inside and hosts three USB ports one of which is Type-C, and an SD card reader accompanied by a full-size HDMI output. Although respective to its size, the Ideapad S340 is a bit hefty to carry around and weighs 3.4 pounds and, you might find the touchpad to be not one of the smoothest. However, apart from that, it provides a great battery backup of up to 10 hours and will surely deliver sufficient performance, only if you delegate it to perform regular desktop work, casual browsing, and light gaming.</p>
<p>It can take a little more than lightweight operations, but make sure not to overburden it with arduous tasks as those might require more powerful specs than an 8GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2NfTUvh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5668 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Acer-Swift-3.jpg" alt="Acer Swift 3 - best 14 inch ultrabook" width="550" height="406"></a></p>
<p>After going through the specs of Acer Swift 3&nbsp;judiciously, I think the high-quality hardware that Acer has used to assemble this ultrabook&nbsp;has to be one of its best features. Being entirely responsive, the <strong>aluminum chassis</strong> is so effortlessly decent that it is bound to catch everyone’s attention. Due to its exclusive appearance, it leaves the impression that it is a steeply priced high end laptop. So if you want to look fancy on a low budget&nbsp;then the Acer Swift 3 might be your go-to choice for best 14 inch laptop.</p>
<p>From the point of view of operational capabilities, the Acer Swift 3 ultrabook is robust enough to be equipped with everyday applications, without compromising its overall performance. Another attractive aspect is the <strong>Whiskey Lake (8th generation)</strong> Intel Core i7-8565U processor, which supports routine tasks and multiple tab operations without any struggle and can also diligently handle gaming, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photographers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo editing on&nbsp;Adobe Photoshop</a>&nbsp;or <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light video editing on&nbsp;Adobe Premiere</a>, all due credit to its dedicated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce MX150 dedicated graphics processor</span>. Moreover it comes with sufficient amount of RAM, 8 GB to be exact and a 256GB SSD for storage.</p>
<p>One of the very few drawbacks of this laptop would be a 3220 mAh battery, that could have been replaced with a larger one, but it’s not too bad either. Another one would be a slightly dim screen that makes it a bit difficult to be used outdoors. But other than that, the Acer Swift 3 is one of the <strong>best 14 inch ultrabook</strong>&nbsp;with latest and greatest specs for users with everyday needs on a low budget.</p>

<h3 id="L6">6. Lenovo Yoga C940 14-Inch Convertible Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://lenovo.vzew.net/RXDna" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5778 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-Yoga-C940-14-Inch-Laptop.jpg" alt="Lenovo Yoga C940 Best 14 Inch Convertible Laptop" width="550" height="434"></a></p>
<p>Who doesn’t want the comfort of using a premium convertible laptop with minimalistic looks and top-notch features. But the entire package sound too good to be real, at least with a reasonable rate. The Lenovo Yoga C940, offers it all and causing only a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">damage of about $1000</a>, the metallic edges and beautiful screen gives off a lavish appearance and apparently comes without a backbone.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the Yoga C940 offers great value for money. A <strong>10th gen Intel Core i5-1035G4 processor</strong>, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is more than enough for an average user to get through his day. The 14 inch wide Full HD display with <strong>wide viewing angles</strong> can definitely be paraded around like a trophy, mainly because of the sharp screen quality and vibrant display of colors. Moreover, it comes with Lenovo Active Pen and what&#8217;s unique though is its hinge which holds the soundbar to project three dimensional audio, and it rotates with the screen to fire sound always in the right direction.</p>
<p>From performance perspectives, this 14 inch laptop was found to be more than adequate and can perform multi-tasking operations and video streaming side by side without any noticeable lag. Still, if you want more power then you can configure the Lenovo Yoga C940 with 14-inch UHD display, up to 16GB of RAM and massive 2TB of SSD.</p>
<p>The drawbacks of Lenovo Yoga C940 are a not so standard webcam and a keyboard with less traveling keys. But these limitations are certainly not critical enough to make us overlook the wide range of eminent features it brings to the table.</p>

<p>The Lenovo Flex 14 is another excellent convertible laptop which offers similar specs and features as the above-mentioned Yoga C940, but for a lot less. It comes with the quad-core i5 processor paired with 16GB RAM and 256GB of SSD which delivers optimum performance for everyday productivity and casual gaming. Moreover, it also has the 14-inch full HD IPS touchscreen panel which supports Pen input. However, the materials used to build the Flex 14 aren&#8217;t as premium as the Yoga C940, and that&#8217;s to match its price tag. Its chassis is made up of polycarbonate material and has sturdy metallic hinges to convert this laptop into different modes with confidence. The build quality, however, is still superior than most other plastic built laptops. So, overall Lenovo Flex 14 is also a great 14-inch convertible laptop for the people who don&#8217;t want to spend much and still don&#8217;t want to miss out on any features of the costly Yoga C940. | <a title="Best Price on Lenovo" href="https://lenovo.vzew.net/M1Y93" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$899.99 from Lenovo</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another ultraportable, convertible laptop in the list which is from a well-renowned laptop manufacturing brand Dell. The Inspiron 5482 is a recently launched 14-inch 2-in-1 laptop which is good enough to land on our top picks of best 14 inch laptops list anywhere, anytime. With a complete <span style="text-decoration: underline;">360 degrees wrap around hinge</span>, the Inspiron 5482 comprises of all the essential features, that are, to be honest not so flattering but good enough to pull through everyday tasks.</p>
<p>How you analyze its performance depends entirely upon your usage and prioritization of specifications. A fair warning, if you are a frequent traveler, this laptop might cause you a bit of inconvenience with its <em>slightly bulky body</em>. That said, the laptop weighs 3.9 pounds which is more than other convertibles in its category. Although you can consider its <strong>tough build quality</strong>&nbsp;a compensatory aspect for the thick weightage. But, the keyboard on this laptop is&nbsp;definitely the star of the show as it sports a backlit keyboard with well-spaced keys.</p>
<p>As far as performance is concerned, the laptop provides ample power to get through all requirements of the average user. It is an <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i5 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel Core i5 powered laptop</a> with an impressive 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.

<p>It appears Lenovo is taking their budget line damn seriously, this being the third addition in this list from their brand. That said, the Lenovo ThinkPad T490 is a more affordable alternative to its lightweight and more premium sibling <a title="Check Price on Lenovo" href="https://Lenovo.vzew.net/Pv2Kq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lenovo&nbsp;ThinkPad X1 Carbon</a>. The ThinkPad T490 has of-course a 14 inch display and it is powered by a current gen Intel core i5 processor paired with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>These configurations when put together are adequate enough to support multi-tab operations and running basic office applications without taking any hiccups. So it is fair to say that Lenovo Thinkpad T490 would be best 14 inch laptop for corporate usage, which requires mainly <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for QuickBooks – Our Most Recommended Business Laptops for Accounting" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-quickbooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accounts management</a>, documentation and other workplace impositions. With strong hardware specs and a decent looks, it is a perfect blend of class, and robust underlying features.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with the Intel UHD 620 graphics this laptop is not at all recommended for hardcore gamers. It can support some original classics without causing any noticeable trouble, but for more up-to-date titles, ThinkPad T490 is a big NO for gaming. Moreover, the display is somewhat lacking and is not a good choice for outdoor usage, especially during bright sunny days. So overall verdict, a perfect office contraption and would do great sitting on your desk.</p>

<p>The <strong>Lenovo ThinkBook 14s</strong> is also a great option if you are looking for a budget business ultrabook. It doesn&#8217;t come with the legendary ThinkPad keyboard, nor it has that rugged business-grade ThinkPad build quality, but it&#8217;s still an all-aluminum built laptop which manages to look premium.

<p>ASUS VivoBook S14 may look like an ordinary laptop from its design, but it is a power packed performer which can handle almost everything you throw at it including gaming. The laptop&#8217;s design is minimalistic with a brushed aluminum lid, and polycarbonate chassis finished in golden color. However, its innards are inversely powerful to handle the requirements of hard-core users. The laptop is powered by an Intel Core i7 quad-core processor with 8GB of RAM and speedy 256GB of SSD. What&#8217;s unique though is it also comes with a dedicated Nvidia GPU which makes this laptop capable enough to handle some of the newest gaming titles.</p>
<p>The display on the ASUS VivoBook S14 is of-course a 14-inch panel and it produces vibrant colors and has wide viewing angles. However, it&#8217;s a bit dim which makes it hard to use this laptop in direct sunlight, but for working indoors, it is perfect. The keyboard on this laptop is another excellent aspect of this laptop. Its keys are backlit, and they are well laid out to get used to with it easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, it also features fingerprint scanner for easy one-touch unlocks and its battery life is also very good which can last up to 8 hours on a single charge. The only let down, the device heats&nbsp;up after only a couple of hours of gaming, but hey what did you expect from a ‘portable’ ‘gaming laptop’. These two terms hardly belong together in a sentence.</p>

<p>While there are no good 14-inch gaming laptops currently, the Razer Blade 15 is the laptop that can still be considered when looking for the best ultraportable gaming laptops. It holds the crown of World&#8217;s Smallest Gaming Laptop right now and although it technically has a 15-inch display, its chassis is still smaller than most of the 14-inch laptops on this list. So, we had to give it a place here.</p>
<p>With a killer slim profile, the Razer Blade 15 boasts a six-core Intel 8th-generation core i7 processor with 16GB of RAM and a speedy 512GB SSD. But its award winning aspects are definitely the VR ready <strong>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 GPU</strong> paired with a smooth <span style="text-decoration: underline;">15.6&#8243; Full HD 144Hz display</span> that gives you a crystal clear illusion of reality.</p>
<p>A <em>feather light chassis with powerful gaming qualities</em> are just too good to be true. Its hardware bits are robust enough to pull through heavy tasks, side-by-side with some quality gaming without leaving any traces of lagging. But all of this does not come cheap and will cause you a damage of $2000 approx so if you can pay the premium then this is the best portable mid-size gaming laptop right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a video editing novice (like yours truly), you might have struggled with several aspects before you could get down to practicing your rudimentary editing skills. It&#8217;s not a big deal though. With the genius pieces of video editing software and computers we have today, it is only a thing of the past that performing intricate video editing tasks were best left to the professionals. Thanks to the dawn of all these revolutionary video editing laptops and softwares, even with limited technical expertise, you can explore the endless prospects 2019 is now offering in the realm of video enhancing.</p>
<p>Although this has to do with a bunch of factors, some of which involve determining what video editor you should use and the machine that will be supporting it. The latter is a bit more complex than it sounds. Shuffling through the range of laptops available currently in the market for basically the video editing, can often be frantic. So we&nbsp;thought you might need a little guide to get you started. Keep reading to gain more insight about the <em><strong>dos and don&#8217;ts when it comes to buying the laptop specifically for video editing</strong></em>&nbsp;and also check out&nbsp;the list of our most recommended video editing laptops&nbsp;with reviews below.</p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">5&nbsp;Things to Consider Before&nbsp;Buying a&nbsp;Video Editing Laptop</h4>
<hr>
<p>Reaching this point, there is quite a typical approach we tend to adopt. Just Google the &#8216;top 10&nbsp;best laptop for video editing&#8217; and pick the one laptop&nbsp;that agrees with your pocket, but if you want to be a video editing guru, there is a lot more to consider than just that. Don’t get me wrong, you could, however, get started just fine with a typical, customary laptop and perform basic video trimmings and add light effects, but as time goes by you will begin encountering some decisive issues which will at that point be unavoidable.</p>
<p>So, give yourself a safe start and analyze different specs which might implicitly influence your video editing activities.</p>
<p>The most common challenges people tend to face are; lack of storage – any high-quality video, will take up a huge chunk of your disk. Now consider a heavily edited HD video. To cram in a bunch of those in your laptop&nbsp;requires a lot more capacity than you can anticipate. Then there are several issues with the horsepower premium video editing softwares require, along with a speedy processor, high-grade graphics and what not.</p>
<p>In this section, I am going to give you a little brief about selecting the best core hardware for video rendering and editing laptop, fragmented into a step-by-step breakdown. So, let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>
<h5><strong>A Powerful Multi-Core&nbsp;Processor</strong></h5>
<p>Know that all your efforts of buying&nbsp;suitable video editing laptop&nbsp;will go in vain if you don’t buy the laptop with a powerful&nbsp;processor. After all, the processor&nbsp;is going to be your underpinning for advanced editing software, graphics cards, and other necessities. For instance, hardcore video editing softwares&nbsp;like Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, and Final Cut Pro&nbsp;will essentially occupy your CPU’s multiple cores and require hyperthreading.&nbsp;Hence, buying the laptop&nbsp;with&nbsp;multiple core processor with&nbsp;hyperthreading capabilities is&nbsp;certainly the best&nbsp;for video editing.</p>
<p>If you are a little tight on money, there are laptops with AMD CPUs which you can opt for. They might not be the most powerful alternative like Intel, but do provide good value for money. Although of course if you want to keep up with the evolving trends, the best option is to upgrade to a better laptop from time to time. Like at this point of time, you will not find a more powerful alternative than a <a title="The 10 Best Laptops with Intel i7 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop&nbsp;running Intel’s i7 processor</a> for video&nbsp;rendering. The range of hyperthreaded 4-core, 6-core, and 8-core processors makes it a solid alternative than the others. You can start off with an&nbsp;<strong>i7-9750H or i7-8750H</strong> and after polishing your skills, move to even more robust CPUs like the&nbsp;<strong>i7-9850H, or the flagship i9-9880H</strong>&nbsp;which is capable of doing wonders with 4K video editing.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5693 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/X264-Benchmark-Processor-Score.png" alt="X264 Video Transcoding Intel CPU Stress Test Score" width="533" height="430">The laptops powered by Quad-Core Intel i5 Processors (i5-9300H, i5-8300H) are <strong>CHEAPER&nbsp;and POWERFUL</strong> than the laptops powered by Quad Core Intel i7 Processors (i7-8565U, i7-8550U). So, if you&#8217;re looking for a pocket-friendly laptop for video editing, then <a title="The Best Laptops with Intel i5 Processor" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by quad core Intel i5 processor</a> will be&nbsp;best options.</p>

</div>
<h5><strong>Top-Notch Discrete&nbsp;Graphics</strong></h5>
<p>Depending on the severity of your use, the graphics card has to be powerful enough to speedily render information into high-quality pixels.</p>
<p>For light video editing, you don’t need a&nbsp;laptop with dedicated graphics as&nbsp;integrated graphics on newer generation processors&nbsp;are powerful enough to&nbsp;get the work done&nbsp;but most latest video editing softwares, efficaciously make use of dedicated graphics through hardware acceleration and it would be highly beneficial if you have&nbsp;an A-grade one on your laptop&nbsp;to obtain the best results.</p>
<p>A few good alternates? Of course, the performance and reliability of Nvidia is unmatched, and their GeForce GTX and newest RTX GPUs, is a revolutionary development in itself. Providing improved efficiency, the new GPUs with ray-tracing features is a major breakthrough for not just video editing purposes but for gaming as well.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#5a8e20;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#8DC153;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Quick Tip -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"></p>
<p>If you <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own an extensive gaming laptop</a>, chances are, it would be a good fit for media rendering purposes as well.</p>
<p></div></div>
<p>For the sake of exploring all possibilities, there is Radeon series of GPUs by AMD offering similar specs and performance. To mention a few, the AMD Radeon Pro series graphics processors are the most superior ones in the bunch for video editing laptop. Although Nvidia has proven to be the unspoken king, AMD is catching up, and there are many AMD powered laptops which give Nvidia powered laptops a good run for their money.</p>
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>Giant Amount of Storage Space</strong></h5>
<p>Of course, you need to store all your edited videos. If you are getting down to some serious motion graphics editing, you should have a few gigabytes to spare on your laptop. If not, there is always a possibility of ramming your files into an external SSD. You could, however, go with a cheaper, hard drive alternative, but from performance perspectives, I’d recommend a good SSD to go with your video editing machine.</p>
<p><a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/33n7WQT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">External drives</a>&nbsp;are known to provide better and more reliable accommodation for your media files than built-in ones. But if you are a frequent traveler, there are&nbsp;some good laptops having a good go-to storage space (You&#8217;ll find them in the list of our top laptop picks below).</p>
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>RAM &#8211; The more the better</strong></h5>
<p>If you don’t want to slam shut your laptop amidst video&nbsp;editing because of unavoidable lagging, buy a&nbsp;laptop with a good amount of RAM. Finding a ‘suitable amount’ of RAM depends massively on your use. If you are working on full HD videos (1920 x 1080), then your computer with a built-in 8&nbsp;to 12 GB RAM&nbsp;would be enough to get you going. For more advanced video resolutions&nbsp;like 4K (and&nbsp;8K), I’d advice to bump your RAM up a notch or just upgrade your laptop.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, you won’t regret spending bucks on an expanded RAM; that is if your budget allows. A good intermittent backup and uninterrupted playback go a long way while professional video editing and this is all due credit to a powerful RAM.</p>
<div class="vc_separator wpb_content_element vc_separator_align_center vc_sep_width_100 vc_sep_dotted vc_sep_border_width_2 vc_sep_pos_align_center vc_separator_no_text vc_sep_color_sky"><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_l"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span><span class="vc_sep_holder vc_sep_holder_r"><span  class="vc_sep_line"></span></span>
</div>
<h5><strong>High-Resolution Display</strong></h5>
<p>The display is another important aspect to check&nbsp;in the laptop for video editing. A color-accurate display with sufficient resolution is required to play and edit videos properly. For an instance, editing a 4K video will be best if done on&nbsp;the laptop with a 4K display. That said, one wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable to&nbsp;edit 4K videos on the laptop with the standard 1080p display because that display will be&nbsp;able to fit pixels up to 1920&#215;1080 only, whereas the resolution of 4K (3840&#215;2160) is twice&nbsp;the resolution of full HD. So, having a 4K display on a laptop will surely have an upper hand while editing videos, but certainly it&#8217;s not necessary&nbsp;for everybody to have one!</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e54c;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF66;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">
<p><em><strong>Note &#8211;</strong> Laptops with 4K resolution display don&#8217;t&nbsp;come cheap, and they also tend to&nbsp;eat a lot of battery power&nbsp;as its hardware has to push everything in 4K resolution. So, don&#8217;t&nbsp;buy a video editing laptop&nbsp;with 4K display unless most of the&nbsp;videos you edit are in&nbsp;4K.</em></p>
<p><em>If you don&#8217;t have to edit videos on-the-go, then we would advise you to buy a 4K monitor separately with your laptop. A <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2IJkzhp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">good one</a> doesn&#8217;t cost much and this way you can have a decent setup when you are editing videos. When you&#8217;re traveling, you can have a laptop with you that has extra battery juice because it doesn&#8217;t have to push extra pixels to accommodate the 4K display.</em></p>

<p>If all this dense technical hardware jibber jabber is hard for you to digest, or you are just looking for some light, occasional video editing laptop, then you can always opt for a comprehensive laptop, that offers a little of all the essential factors mentioned above.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s begin with&nbsp;the list of our top picks of laptops offering the perfect blend of speed, high-quality display and sufficient storage which makes them the best video editing laptops.</p>

<p>While there are high-end detachable laptops like <a title="See it on HP" href="http://tidd.ly/452b45e8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HP ZBook</a>, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is our top choice of detachable for video editing right now. It is available in two different sizes with 13 or 15 inch pixelsense touchscreen display but we recommend its 15-inch variant for video editing because it comes with more powerful CPU and GPU. It is powered by the newest 8th Gen Intel Core i7 quad-core processor and can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. The biggest reason to opt for a 15 inch variant over 13 inch is the GPU. The 15-inch Surface Book 2 comes with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6 GB of DDR5 graphics memory</span> while the 13-inch variant offers GTX 1050 with 2GB VRAM. So, definitely 15-inch variant is the one you should get if you want to edit and render 4K videos fast and seamlessly.</p>
<p>As far as design and build-quality of the laptop is concerned, the laptop feels very well put together and it is very ergonomically designed laptop. The laptop&#8217;s screen can be completely detached to use it as a tablet and its unique fulcrum hinges allows it to use in various other modes.

<p>The recently launched <a href="https://amzn.to/2MDPhtl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asus ROG Strix Scar III laptop</a> comes in various models based on size and hardware specifications. However, we still love its predecessor, the ROG Strix Scar II laptop, because it offers so much more at affordable rates. It comes with a very powerful Intel 8th Gen i7 six-core processor, and it is perfect for demanding tasks like video editing.</p>
<p>The Scar II is the perfect laptop for people who like to work on bigger displays. It has 17.3 inch full HD IPS 144Hz display with ultra-fast 3ms response time. Although, that high refresh rate won&#8217;t help in video editing but it does smooths out all the transitions and improves overall video editing experience. The perfect display with the high-performance hardware is what makes this laptop one of the best choices for video editing.</p>
<p>With that said, it has a hexa-core coffee lake Intel i7 processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics to backup all your video editing and rendering needs. The multitasking on this laptop is also pretty well managed by its 16GB of RAM and it offers fast and spacious 1TB HDD and 256GB of PCIe SSD to store all your videos locally on the laptop.</p>
<p>With the price tag of near to $1,300, the Asus ROG Strix Scar II is one of the best 17-inch laptops for video editing that you can buy right now.</p>

<h3 id="L6">6. Apple MacBook Pro 15 with Touch Bar&nbsp;<span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best Mac for Video Editing</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IQzhmH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4856 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MacBook-Pro-15-with-touch-bar.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro with Touch bar - Professional's Recommended Laptop for Video Editing" width="863" height="346"></a></p>
<p>When it comes to content creation, most professionals choose &#8216;Apple&#8217;&nbsp;for their work and when we&#8217;re talking about Video Editing specifically, there&#8217;s no better laptop than the new MacBook Pro with Touch bar. The touch bar on the new MacBook&nbsp;Pro helps a lot while editing videos&nbsp;and if your preferred video editor is <a href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Final Cut Pro</a>, then it can really do wonders. You can easily scrub through your video timeline using the touch bar without a single mouse click (as shown in the image below). Can video editing get more easier and convenient than this?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro.jpg" alt="video editing on final cut pro touchbar representation" width="928" height="400" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro.jpg 928w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-300x129.jpg 300w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-768x331.jpg 768w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-610x263.jpg 610w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-600x259.jpg 600w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/final-cut-pro-touch-bar-macbook-pro-50x22.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></p>
<p>Apart from the new touch bar, MacBook Pro comes with a lot of other compelling features too.&nbsp;It has 15.4-inch retina display which is one of the best displays&nbsp;Apple makes currently.&nbsp;The display on the new MacBook Pro can get bright up to whopping 500 nits which is the brightest panel ever made for the laptop computers&nbsp;and it also has 25% more colors than the sRGB so color accuracy and brightness are not an issue here.</p>
<p>On the hardware front, this laptop has latest 9th generation Intel Core i7 six-core 2.6 GHz processor paired with the 16GB of RAM and dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 555x graphics which are good enough specs for editing high-resolution videos. Well, if you want even more power, then you can also configure the <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/32rSW44" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Pro 15 with Intel Core i9 processor</a> and up to Radeon Pro Vega 20 GPU.</p>
<p>The lacking factors of this laptop are its slightly limited storage and limited (very limited actually) choice of ports selection. This laptop has 256GB of SSD which is low and might become a problem if your use involves large media files or editing utilities but if you&#8217;re ready to spend more money then there are MacBook Pro models available with more amount of storage (up to 4TB). The ports that the new MacBook Pro offer, includes only 4 x Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. That&#8217;s it! This will force you to buy and carry the &#8220;dongles&#8221; with you everywhere but this is also where the future is headed, right?</p>
<p>So on a conclusive note, The 2019 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is one of the most powerful, lightweight and advanced laptops for video editing with a steep price tag, but not too steep for video editing professionals who can spend a couple of hundred bucks more for high-grade machinery.</p>

Performance wise this is a pretty abled laptop and can easily handle 1080p and even 4K video editing tasks.</p>
<p>It has 15.6 inches of full HD IPS display which is color accurate and has great viewing angles, but, it doesn&#8217;t get enough bright to use comfortably in well-lighted areas.&nbsp;As far as ports and slots on this laptop are concerned, it provides all the required ones including Thunderbolt USB Type-C port which can support <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>single 5K display or dual 4K display output</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Overall, Dell G5 offers a solid set of features combined with Dell&#8217;s robustness and reliability. Hence, it is the perfect laptop for users who are looking for a video editing laptop under $1000.</p>

<p>The predecessor of this laptop, the <a title="Check Price and Read Reviews on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2MNs5sY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Acer Aspire E 15</a> is still one of the best budget laptops, however, the newer Aspire 5 is also power packed budget machine with a very compelling set of features. The build quality and design are almost same as the previous generation so the changes are only in the hardware that this new variant packs inside.</p>
<p>Assembled with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 quad-core processor, clocked up to 3.9GHz, this laptop on the list can rightly be titled as a <strong>‘BEST BUDGET VIDEO EDITING LAPTOP’</strong>, holding a price tag as low as $650 and fortunately, this cut-throat price tag has no effect on the laptop’s comprehensive specs. Running on a 8GB RAM and holding a 512 GB SSD for storage, this is the best laptop for video editing under $700 for light-pocketed youtubers or students of film major.</p>
<p>It also inhabits a crystal clear LED-backlit 15.6 inches full HD IPS display with tiny bezels. I’d say that this is not at all a bad package to go for the price that it comes with.</p>

<h3 id="L10">10. MSI GT63 TITAN-032 15.6 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2ps8OoM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4822 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MSI-GT63-TITAN-052-15.6-inch-Gaming-Laptop.jpg" alt="MSI GT63 Titan-032 15-inch High End Video Editing Laptop" width="600" height="587"></a></p>
<p>Another MSI laptop&nbsp;in our list of video editing laptops which is again a very high-performance machine&nbsp;with similar gaming hued design and build quality. The MSI GT63 Titan is actually&nbsp;a gaming laptop but its performance would be more justified if we will call it as a <strong>&#8220;workstation laptop&#8221;</strong> as it happens to be&nbsp;the most powerful and of course the most expensive laptop we have on the list here.</p>
<p>It is powered by an ultra high-end Intel Core i7-8750H processor with clock frequency of up to <strong>4.1GHz</strong> and has&nbsp;Nvidia&nbsp;GeForce <strong>RTX 2080</strong> 8GB DDR5 graphics. To handle this high-performance hardware, it has 16GB of DDR4 RAM which can be upgraded up to mammoth 64GB!&nbsp;These aren&#8217;t any ordinary <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thousand&nbsp;dollar laptop</a> hardware specifications.&nbsp;These are the workstation grade CPU and GPU&nbsp;which are found on the laptops meant to fulfill&nbsp;the most intense computing requirements like <a title="The Best Laptops for CAD – Our Most Recommended Laptops for AutoCAD &amp; SOLIDWORKS" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-cad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAD or&nbsp;3D modeling</a> and certainly these specs are also best for 4K (and futuristic 8K)&nbsp;video editing.</p>
<p>The display of MSI GT63 Titan is the biggest let down as it comes with 15.6 inch display with just full HD resolution. However, it has a fast 144Hz refresh-rate and it&#8217;s an IPS panel so it is bright, color accurate and offers really good viewing angles. There&#8217;s also no shortage of the storage space here as this laptop houses a 256GB of SSD and a large 1TB of hard drive. The only room for improvement here would be cutting down on weight a bit and of course the PRICE. This futuristic laptop does not come cheap and costs about solid $2700.</p>
<p>On a conclusive note, The MSI GT63 Titan is&nbsp;a highly advanced rig&nbsp;and is the perfect pick for editing pros looking for a VR ready high-end laptop&nbsp;to get set with their adept video editing&nbsp;skills.</p>

<h3>ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX531 Laptop <span class="su-label su-label-type-info">Lightest Laptop for Video Editing with GTX 1080</span></h3>
<p>The all-new <strong>ASUS ROG Zephyrus S</strong> is the most powerful and lightest laptop you can buy for video editing right now.</p>

All these ultra high-end hardware comes in the chassis which is just 0.6&#8243; thick and weighs only 5 pounds!</p>
<p>The only thing which is disappointing on this laptop is its 1080p display. With the hardware capable of firing up multiple 4K displays, the full HD display on this laptop doesn&#8217;t wholly utilize the hardware of this laptop.</p>
<p>But, you can always connect external 4K monitors for better video editing experience, and the hardware of this laptop can push up to three 4K monitors at once. So overall, if you&#8217;re looking for a lightweight machine that doesn&#8217;t compromise on the performance, and of-course if budget is not a problem for you, then ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX531 is the best video editing laptop for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Linux was once alienated by PC users as an Operating System and was sidelined by many manufacturers as well. But this was over two decades ago. Today, the OS has evolved to be known as the most powerful and durable among distributors.</p>
<p>But not everything about the OS has progressed with time. The installation of Linux on the laptop or a desktop back then was as easy as burning your CD with an ISO and pressing a few buttons. To make things even easier, Canonical saved you that trouble as well and sent you one for free. Today, before switching to Linux you need to conduct an in-depth hardware analysis because of its fastidious hardware compatibility. Linux as an OS is quite picky with hardware support, and before diving into its painful installation process, you need to make sure you are not wrestling with the wrong kind of hardware, designed to support only compliant OSs like Windows.</p>
<p>You need to be a proficient hardware shopper if you want to find the best linux laptop. Don’t worry if you are not, keep reading to become one.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a Linux geek and can find the best linux laptop for yourself on your own then feel free to skip to the list of our <a href="#toppicks"><strong>Top Picks of Best Linux Laptops</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a complete Linux novice, then I recommend you to continue reading below, to know about all the things that you need to take care while buying the laptop for linux operating system.</p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to Buy The Best Laptop for Linux?</strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_3008" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/sc/laptops?appliedRefinements=10673" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3008" class="wp-image-3008 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dell-xps-13-developer-edition-1.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 developer edition" width="700" height="465"></a><p id="caption-attachment-3008" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition &#8211; The Best Linux Laptop</strong></em></p></div>
<p>I think the simplest way to find the best laptop for ubuntu or any other linux distro, for to-be Linux users is to ask themselves these questions:</p>
<h5>What features do I need?</h5>
<p>At this point, it is the same as purchasing any another laptop; “features it should have”. Think about the reasons you want to switch to Linux and look for the appropriate hardware peripherals able to meet those needs. Just the RAM, GPU, processing power, external and internal cards, disk storage capacity etc., the usual stuff.</p>
<p>When you have shortlisted a few laptop models befitting your requirements, this is where the easy stuff ends.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e57f;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF99;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"></p>
<p><strong>Note &#8211;</strong> Buying a fancy touchscreen laptops for linux is not always the right decision because linux distros that supports touch interface are very limited. To name a few, Ubuntu and Fedora are the most popular ones among the touchscreen linux users. In case, if you want to use touchscreen with other distros then finding the right drivers for different touchscreen laptop models is a huge hassle.</p>
<p>Same goes for laptops with fingerprint scanner as well. While some popular linux distros like Ubuntu does support logging in with fingerprint but for most other distros you&#8217;ll have to find drivers on your own.</p>
<p></div></div>
<h5>Can I save some money and buy an old or refurbished laptop for linux?</h5>
<p>Of course, you can. When I mentioned the fussiness of hardware support in Linux, it didn’t imply towards them being ‘expensive’. In fact, it is one of the biggest reasons to switch to Linux. It works like a charm with <a title="Top 5 Best Budget Refurbished Laptops Under $100" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-100-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old laptops</a> and computers as well. Linux has the flexibility to run flawlessly on inexpensive, outdated hardware as opposed to Windows, offering a sub-standard performance spectrum on even <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">high-end machines</a>.</p>
<p>There is a lot of room to play with its versions as well. If a distro of Linux fails to acclimate with certain hardware units, you can always opt for the other. Take an example of <a title="Lubuntu - Lightweight Linux Distro" href="http://lubuntu.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lubuntu</a>. It is a lightweight base system with Lxde desktop and inhibits all the assets of the infamous Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The latter, however, might struggle with a system having less than 2GB of RAM. Whereas Linux’s flavor Lubuntu is known for its lightning fast performance and also comes bundled with an entire range of drivers.</p>
<h5>Or should I just save myself the trouble and buy a pre-installed Linux laptop?</h5>
<p>If all this hustle and bustle of rummaging laptop models and hardware is too much for you, there is always the pre-installed laptop option available for Linux <em>(you&#8217;ll find our top picks of laptops with pre-installed Linux operating system listed below)</em>. Although this might confine your options in terms of hardware specifications and distros but is in fact the only fallback you need to embrace.</p>
<h5>OK, but what do others say about laptops for Linux?</h5>
<p>A second opinion never hurts. Considering the vast variation available in Linux involving laptop models, new PCs, old PCs, its distros &#8211; there are strong chances you might not find everything you need. Blog reviews and help <a title="AskUbuntu - Forums" href="https://askubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">forums</a> are a good place to start and will give you some strong, personal insight about the laptop you have shortlisted as well but if you end up finding nothing at all that you can use, be prepared for some good <em>and</em> bad surprises.</p>

	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Why Choose Linux over Windows and macOS?</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3006 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-and-macos.jpg" alt="windows vs linux vs macos" width="736" height="450"></p>
<p>Though all those efforts eventually pay off when you find the perfect laptop and Linux distribution to use. Linux as an OS, adds a lot of value to your daily solutions due to a number of reasons. One of them being its advanced customizability which allows Linux users the flexibility to mold their OS in accordance with their standards. This is one feature that its competitors, Windows and macOS lack.</p>
<p>Another persuasive factor to switch to Linux is the <strong>privacy and security</strong> it offers, which is a lot to ask these days from modern OSs. It is certainly an appreciable precept of Linux to respect a user’s discretion. With Linux, you are free from the frets of some company owning your personal data. Linux is structured in a manner that does not require a user’s personal data for profiling, nor does it have any incentives to store your data on a cloud for “safe-keeping”.</p>
<p>There is also a certain amount of stability that Linux has developed over the years with its distros. Rather than adding glitz and glamor like its competitors, Linux’s upgrades involve increasing OS stability, ease of usage and removing excessive baggage in each release.</p>
<p>From a personal standpoint, I believe the creators of Linux have maintained a conspicuous trajectory when it comes to improving their OS. As opposed to Microsoft which often releases with a disappoint of a version after a couple of Windows builds, and macOS that is restricting user control day by day, Linux’s upgraded features are here to stay and every release is a sure <em>step forward</em> rather than backwards. No matter how minor or major the change may be.</p>
<p>While there are lot other reasons to prove that linux is better than Windows and macOS, we would prefer to not discuss all of them here as this guide is more about <strong>laptops for linux</strong> and not why linux is a better OS. If you want to dive deeper into the comparison of these operating systems, then there are lot of in-depth comparison articles you can find on Google.</p>
<p>By now you might have made your mind whether you want a Linux laptop or not. Interested users, keep reading to find out the next step in buying the best linux laptop.</p>

<h2 id="toppicks" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Linux Laptops &#8211; Top Picks</span></h2>
<p>The considerations to deliberate upon when it comes to buying a Linux laptop are endless. Starting from hardware compatibility and ending on distros. Buying a best laptop for linux is a work of art.</p>
<p>If you are dabbling with Linux for the first time, you might want to familiarize yourself a little with its Distros. <a title="Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux Distros or “Distributions”</a> are software packages which pack several open-source projects into an installable operating system.</p>
<p>I have already given a brief intro of Lubuntu in the beginning so let’s skip to <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> – the most popular and our most recommended Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is the perfect place to start for Linux newbies. I say this because of its user-friendly interface that is a little different from traditional Windows. Easily installable, just requires an additional driver installing tool to get your hardwares rolling.</p>
<p>While Ubuntu is more of a smartphone cross-device focused operating system, Windows users might feel a little closer to home with <a title="Linux Mint - Linux Distro similar to Windows" href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Linux Mint</a>. Mint is designed to improve the traditional desktop experience.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other linux distros to try. You can check out some of the most popular ones <a href="https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-distributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;if you&#8217;re tech savvy enough to find your favorite linux distro on your own then <a title="Distrowatch - Directory of Linux Distros" href="http://distrowatch.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Distrowatch</a> is a great place to discover new linux distros and learn about some of the oldest linux distros at one place.</p>
<p>Now that you have surpassed the boring but the necessary information, let’s get to the good stuff.</p>
<p>Linux laptops can be classified into three groups from a user’s perspective:</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Best Laptops with Pre-installed Linux Operating Systems</strong></h3>
<p>There is a common misconception that all good laptops come with the ritual of wiping Windows clean and installing a Linux distribution from scratch but things are gradually changing. To break the stereotype, here are a few laptops that come loaded with a Linux OS.</p>
<h3 id="L1">1. Dell XPS 13&nbsp;<span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Most Recommended</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9380-laptop/cax13w10p1c706subuntu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5660 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-2019.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition" width="550" height="368"></a></p>
<p>Topping the list is one of the most renowned laptop &#8211; Dell XPS 13 which is the best Linux laptop available right now. Dangling between standard to steep price ranges, its various models start from around $900 and goes up to $1,900.</p>
<p>As we prefer budget machines, lets dive into the specs of Dell XPS 13 with Intel Core i5 processor. The display is absolutely gorgeous and one of its most attractive traits. The bezels are only a few millimeters thick and the 13.3-inch edge-to-edge full HD display is a treat to eyes. To sweeten up the deal even more, Dell threw in a option to get up to 16GBs of DDR3 RAM.</p>
<p>With its pre-installed Ubuntu Linux&nbsp;18.04 OS, compilation of Linux Kernel is a matter of a couple of minutes and its hassle free optimization aspects make it the best linux laptop for developers.</p>

<p>Packing a speedy 8th Gen Intel Core i7-8565U quad-core processor inside a sleek, minimalistic chassis, the Galago Pro gives off the look and feel of the ever classy <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2Mj2nMK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MacBook Pro</a>. Apart from its feather light aluminum body, there is a massive 8GB of RAM to handle your multitasking needs and it comes with one USB-C Thunderbolt, two USB 3.1, Ethernet, HDMI and mini display ports, and an SD Card Reader.</p>

<p>Not a complete winner unlike the Dell XPS 13, but of $1,100 its specs are undeniably lustrous. Offering the latest Whiskey Lake (8th Gen) version of Intel i7 chip, the Galago Pro has landed itself an advantage as the latest Linux release offers advanced support for new Intel processors.</p>
<p>The only downside is its below average battery life that for a price tag this exorbitant could have been improved.</p>

<p>This is the cheapest linux laptop one can buy. Hence, it is perfect if you want to experiment with Linux.</p>
<p>Pinebook Pro is the best budget linux laptop which comes for as cheap as $200. With a full HD display of 14 inch, the Pinebook comes with an ARM Cortex dual-core processor and eMMC storage of 64GB.</p>
<p>Though everything else gives off a cheap vibe. From the shoddy keyboard to the mediocre battery life. Safe to say that Pinebook Pro is not a Linux based companion for the long haul, but a good place to start if you are on a strict budget or trialing Linux as an OS for your daily use.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Best Windows Laptops Compatible with Linux</strong></h3>
<p>While many PC manufacturing giants have welcomed Linux with open arms, there is still a long way for the OS to go before it can catch up with Windows as a default OS. Also, for some of you who don’t want to let go of their favorite windows PC and want to dual-boot Linux on their laptop, here are a few Windows based machines whose hardwares will work like a well-oiled wheel with Ubuntu.</p>
<h3 id="L5">5. Acer Aspire E 15 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Most Recommended Laptop for Dual Booting Linux</span></h3>

<p>Acer with this Aspire model, went a long way to perfect literally everything they can to make a premium device under a budget. For <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $400" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-400-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">less than $400</a>, the Acer Aspire E 15 boasts a full-HD 15.6 inch LED backlit display, a sturdy battery life and a gigantic 1TB storage to dual-boot windows and linux on this laptop.</p>
<p>The plastic body, keyboard and the speakers are quite sub-standard, but considering the price tag I don’t think there is any reason to complain. The size of Acer Aspire E 15 is considerably large, and given its 5.2 pound weight it’s safe to mark this one as a non-portable machine. But, that is about it for the negatives, the <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8th Gen Intel Core i3 processor</a> and 6GB of RAM perform surprisingly good and for multitaskers on a low budget, this is a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>Even it provides RAM and storage upgrading options. What else do you need? Therefore, Acer Aspire E15 E5-576-392H is our most recommended budget laptop for linux to install your favorite linux distribution and enjoy freedom of open source computing.</p>

<p>With the power, packaging and performance of a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $1000" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-1000-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1000 worth laptop</a>, The ASUS Zenbook bears a cost of only $700. The 1080p HD display is sharp and vibrant which is great for video streaming and light gaming. However, hardcore gamers might need a little more solidity than an Intel UHD 620 Graphics that it offers.</p>
<p>The battery life is a huge plus. Known to last over 10 hours on backup, the ASUS Zenbook has managed to achieve a decent rating over <a title="Best Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2IqYwvS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Acer Swift 3</a> and <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2ItklLj" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HP Envy 13t 2019</a>. The processor is not so bad itself, a kaby lake-R Intel Core i5-8250U paired with an 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, maintains a solid ground on performance and multitasking capabilities in any linux distro that you may install.</p>
<p>The only downside of buying this laptop for linux is, it has a fingerprint scanner so finding right packages and drivers for getting it working with all the linux distros that you install can be little troublesome. But, if you&#8217;re fine with unlocking your laptop traditionally with a password then ASUS ZenBook UX331UA is the best ultrabook for linux that you can buy right now.</p>

<h3 id="L7">7. HP Stream&nbsp;14 <span class="su-label su-label-type-info">Cheap Laptop for Linux</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IvZ7MR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5758 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HP-Stream-14-2019.jpg" alt="HP Stream 14-ds0050nr - best cheap linux laptop" width="550" height="357"></a></p>
<p>Okay let’s get down to some REAL saving now. If you are on a tighter budget, looking for a Linux AND Windows compatible machine, HP offers exceptional value for money with their HP Stream 14.</p>
<p>This is not exactly a premium machine (and not that you were even expecting it to be) but does meet the needs of an average user. Based on its price tag and specs, it is obvious that HP Stream is targeted primarily at students, and domestic usage.</p>
<p>For $230, HP is offering a pretty standard 14 inch display, a 4GB RAM and a 64 GB built-in storage packed inside a royal blue, rose pink or diamond white. The HD display is nowhere near extraordinary, nor is the uncomfortably stuff keyboard but overall offers much more than an average laptop at this price. Thankfully, the battery life is extraordinary. During our test it lasted up to 9 hours which is really great considering the price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><strong>Note &#8211;</strong> You cannot dual boot Windows and Linux OS on this laptop because of its low storage space. You can either install Windows or Linux OS at a time and use it. Even if you manage to dual-boot both the OSs, it wouldn&#8217;t be a good computing experience.</div></div>

<h3 id="L8">8. ASUS VivoBook S15</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/357ZiaR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5678 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ASUS-VivoBook-S15-2019.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S15 - best laptop for ubuntu" width="550" height="348"></a></p>
<p>With dynamic looks, ASUS Vivobook S15 starts at around $700 but the battery life is nothing short of disappointing. At an exorbitant cost, the battery life is quite ordinary but thankfully it has a quick charging feature which charges up to 60% of the laptop battery in just 49 minutes. Other than that, the 15-inch display is remarkably good and is a sure head turner if used in public.</p>
<p>The inside is just as lustrous as the outside. Packing an 8th generation quad-core&nbsp;Intel Core i5 processor paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of solid state drive storage, the laptop is perfect for power users who wants to run Linux OS alongside Windows and take benefit of both worlds.</p>
<p>It also comes with all the essential ports and slots including the USB Type-C 3.1 port. With a feather light design (just 3.9 pounds), the ASUS VivoBook S15 is the best linux laptop for businesspeople with a lot of storage to dual boot operating systems.</p>

<h3 id="L9">9. Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Slyfl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3929 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/acer-predator-helios-300-gaming-laptop-ph315-51-78np.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Helios 300 High Performance Laptop for Ubuntu Linux" width="500" height="337"></a></p>
<p>Maintaining versatility in this list, I am going to address all sorts of users and now comes the pro gamers. Such users have slightly peculiar needs and a little more amenable budget. The Acer Predator Helios 300’s star feature is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU</span> but yes, it comes with a price and that is around $1000.</p>
<p>Though the pricing factor is much more accommodating than others in the race, hence ending up on a best laptops for linux list. The VR-ready gaming beast boasts a <em><strong>144Hz 15.6-inch full HD display</strong></em> which is not the sharpest and brightest you can get, but it has the fastest refresh rate display among the gaming laptops in its price range. The speakers are in the right place and the sound is quite cool for gaming with a perfect balance between pitch and intensity.</p>
<p>Of course gamers wouldn’t settle for anything less than a hexa-core <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel Core i7 processor</a> and lightning fast 16GB RAM. The multi-tasking on this machine doesn’t need to be specified as its quite obvious, although the battery life is impressive as well, lasting for over 6 hours without an outlet.</p>
<p>But if the cost is still a little too much for your taste, try the cheaper alternative, <a title="Check Price on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/30Vc8Wo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MSI GF63 9SC-614 Gaming Laptop</a> with the 9th Gen Intel Quad Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. Yeah, it doesn’t offer the spectacular GTX 1060 GPU but for $799 you’d be getting GeForce GTX 1650 Graphics which is also a very good GPU for playing games and doing photo or video editing on Linux.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Best Chromebooks for Linux</strong></h3>
<p>Chromebooks are cheap alternatives for Linux users. Crammed up with Linux compatible drivers, the Chrome OS is quite similar to a Linux desktop interface but don’t exactly work as Ubuntu beasts. The Chromebooks are not designed to support the needs of power users, nor are they a good fit for code compilation. The most you can expect out of them is lightweight multitasking and seamless hardware compatibility at a budget price.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e57f;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF99;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">In case if you&#8217;re wondering, what linux distro will be best for the low-end hardware of chromebooks then here are <a title="Best Linux Distros for Chromebooks" href="https://www.linux.com/blog/four-linux-distributions-chromebook-lovers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few linux distros</a> that works well with most of the chromebook models.</p>
<p>In case, if you want to install Ubuntu on Chromebook, here&#8217;s a detailed <a title="How to Install Ubuntu on Chromebook?" href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-install-linux-on-a-chromebook-and-unlock-its-ful-509039343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step by step guide</a>&nbsp;on how to install Ubuntu on Chromebook with Crouton.</div></div>
<h3 id="L10">10. Acer Chromebook 514</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IxB67U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5272 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Acer-Chromebook-514.jpg" alt="Acer Chromebook 514 - best chromebook for linux" width="550" height="339"></a></p>
<p>Possessing the look and feel of a premium laptop, the Acer Chromebook 514 would cause you a total damage of $250 only. With that, you will also get a crisp 1080p 14-inch display screen with an aluminum chassis.</p>
<p>With the Intel Celeron dual-core N3350 processor, and 4GB of RAM you get enough room to breathe and run any linux distro you want. Although it comes with only 32 GB of built-in memory, it has an SD card slot to extend its storage and accommodate more files. Moreover, it comes with a very responsive touchpad and a&nbsp;<strong>backlit keyboard</strong>&nbsp;which is a rare scene at this price range.</p>
<p>But if you have higher expectations from a <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near $300 laptop</a>, you can try the even cheaper alternate- the <a href="https://amzn.to/2EbPNxa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Acer Chromebook 11</a>,&nbsp;with 4GB RAM and even marginal 16GB internal memory, though it does come with an SD card slot.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that these laptops are designed to be rugged and support only basic usage alongside providing enough room to work with multiple webpages. For users who rely on heavy media manipulation, code compilation or advanced design tools, check out other chromebooks for linux mentioned below.</p>

<h3 id="L11">11. ASUS Chromebook Flip&nbsp;<span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best Convertible Chromebook for Linux</span></h3>

<p>The best chromebook for linux with convertibility. The ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4 is definitely an upgrade from traditional notebooks but as the specs ascended, so did the price. For $460, you will be getting a robust machine for sure, with an extended battery life and strong performance, but Chromebooks just can’t seem to ace Android compatibility which somehow they improved with FLIP but they still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Well, who cares? Any ways you are going to install Linux on it. Right?</p>
<p>Being a convertible, expectations extend towards its usability as a tablet but you need to find the right linux distro to work with touchscreen and all other versatility features that this chromebook offers.</p>
<p>But the Notebook definitely puts your money in the right place and offers comfortable hardware controls with an elegant chassis and a garish display.</p>

<p>Just when we thought Chromebooks were too vanilla, Acer brought out the real stuff and to add even more buzz, amended the phrase ‘for work’ with the name.

<p>The Acer Chromebook 13 in particular complies with “Google for Work” which is spot-on for businesses heavily relying on everything Google Apps and with 32GB of internal storage to spare for external applications.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven’t been living in a cave for the past decade, you’d know how the use of personal computers has evolved over the years. With giant PCs (which took up more than half of your desk space) almost turning obsolete, the tech market is flooding with range of powerful and best 11 inch laptops which might be just the kind of machines this generation needs.</p>
<p>Now that I have acknowledged the significance of portable computers, I might just add that the evolution of laptops is continuously pushing towards more sleek, slim and power-efficient designs. At some point you might have felt the need to have a feather light, compact laptop&nbsp;that you could carry around without having to worry about the ‘extra baggage’. The one which doesn’t urge you to stay confined in a single place just because traveling or moving around with a bulky laptop is too much work.</p>
<p>If you are even slightly convinced with the idea that I am trying to put forward, then here is the full fledged laptop buying&nbsp;guide to buy the&nbsp;<em>best 11 inch laptops</em>&nbsp;which will surely help&nbsp;you to buy the best ultraportable laptop for yourself.<span id="more-2048"></span></p>
<p>Before we proceed with the list of best ultraportable 11 inch laptops,&nbsp;here&#8217;s an overview of the hardware specifications and performance that you can expect from the ultraportable 11-inch laptops. Please go through it otherwise you might end up buying the wrong laptop for yourself!</p>

	</div><p>The 11 inch laptops are undoubtedly the best ultraportable laptops for web surfing, editing documents, watching movies and for everything in between but they aren&#8217;t made for power users. You cannot play games or do <a title="Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo editing</a> or <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/">video editing</a>&nbsp;work on these laptops because most of the 11 inch laptops are powered by&nbsp;Intel Celeron or Intel Pentium processors. These are very <em>low powered&nbsp;processors</em>&nbsp;from Intel&nbsp;which are specifically designed&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="The Best Netbooks and Chromebooks under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netbooks and Chromebooks categories of laptops</a>. Hence, the laptops with 11 inch display&nbsp;may not be capable enough to handle the most intense and demanding tasks but they are best in terms of portability&nbsp;and versatility with reliable performance and battery backup.</p>

<p>Apart from low powered CPU, the 11 inch&nbsp;laptops also lacks behind in offering sufficient amount of storage for most of the user&#8217;s requirements. Most of the&nbsp;11 inch display laptops&nbsp;offers 16, 32&nbsp;or 64GB of eMMC storage which is very low but there&#8217;s always an option to store files on&nbsp;cloud or expanding the memory via&nbsp;an SD card slot.&nbsp;Well there are some&nbsp;11 inch laptop models with&nbsp;128GB SSD and even 500GB&nbsp;HDD but they&nbsp;are very rare and on the side note,&nbsp;<strong>hard drives also tend to make the laptops a little heavier</strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking for a ultraportable laptop for normal requirements which is&nbsp;easy to carry around and work on the go then yes, 11 inch laptops are best for you and you can start reading&nbsp;the list of our top recommended best 11 inch laptops&nbsp;below.</p>

<p>When it comes to resilient convertibles, DELL is the only empowering name that emerges from the horde of PC manufacturers, mainly due to the ingenuity and efficiency that they are known to bring to the table.</p>
<p>For this particularly affordable model, the pros are definitely the light, classy chassis. To add more points to its overall performance, it is powered&nbsp;with the latest generation AMD A9 processor that operates at a speed of&nbsp;2.6GHz. Considering the price, it is not a bad deal to go with&nbsp;as the dual core processor can take up friendly tasks quite efficiently and a little bit of advance processing as well. Moreover, the built-in CPU is robust enough for standard stuff like video streaming, media editing, illustrating, so on and so forth. The 11 inch display is not only impeccable but also allows seamless touch-sensitive navigation between laptop and tablet-mode.</p>
<p>The cons? Non-upgradable RAM. So you’d have to do with a single 4GB module of DDR4 RAM that it comes with, operating at 2400MHz.</p>
<p>So asking all the right questions, should you buy this 11 inch laptop? Well, if you are a power user, NO as there are plenty more rational options you can avail in this price range (keep reading to learn more) but if you are a sucker for compatibility and convertibility while staying under budget, this is one of the best 11 inch laptop you can get.</p>

<h3>2. Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11E (5th Gen)</h3>
<p><a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2F11e-and-chromebooks%2FThinkPad-Yoga-11e-5th-Gen%2Fp%2F22TP2TX154E20LM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3257 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Lenovo-ThinkPad-11e-4th-Gen.jpg" alt="Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11E Convertible Ultrabook" width="550" height="388"></a></p>
<p>If you are one of those not-so-delicate users and need a robust machine that is capable of taking a few bumps and bruises, suitable for the life on the road or a classroom &#8211; Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11e is what’s missing from your life. With scratch-resistant glass, reinforced hinges, the rugged chassis of this midrange convertible-hybrid laptop is capable of what we can call ‘shapeshifting’. For easily bored comrades, Lenovo has come up with a design which you can position in four different modes, Display, Laptop, Tablet, and Tent.</p>
<p>Powered by an Intel Celeron N4100 processor and 4GB of memory, this&nbsp;11 inch ultrabook&nbsp;kind of scores an average rating on operability aspects. On battery run-down tests, the device lasted a middling 7 hours 22 minutes. So not an over the top backup, but not one of the worst either.</p>
<p>So, overall Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 11e is on the list because of (a) its miniature design and (b) because of its high resilience to withstand extreme temperatures,&nbsp;humidity, vibration, dust and of course a few shunts. Although it won’t deliver grade A performance, especially when compared to its contending laptops, but it&#8217;s well-spaced chiclet-style keys, gorilla glass, rounded corners, and a rubber bumper certainly add points to its durability and long term reliability.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not a fan of convertible laptops and would like to have similar specs and features in a traditional clamshell chassis, then Lenovo also has a <strong>ThinkPad 11E</strong> which is a normal laptop with 11.6-inch display, and just like above mentioned ThinkPad Yoga 11E, it also has reinforced ports and hinges and rubberized bumpers to protect it from shocks. | <strong><a title="Best Price on Lenovo" href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/362955/218864/3808?subId1=laptopunderbudget&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2F11e-and-chromebooks%2FThinkPad-11e-5th-Gen%2Fp%2F22TP2TX154E20LQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check price on Lenovo</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Acer Chromebook CB3-132-C4VV 11 Inch Laptop</h3>

<p>A neat, sleek and elegant design offering a range of unique features, the Acer Chromebook CB3-132-C4VV is one of the most affordable and best 11 inch laptop&nbsp;that won’t make you go bankrupt. It is an updated 2016 edition of the popular CB3-132 series from Acer and while it might not acquire a high-scale rating when it comes to power processing but does offer stable performance and a longer battery life.</p>
<p>Running on an Intel Celeron N3060 Dual-Core Processor 2.48GHz, a 4GB RAM and 16GB of flash storage, you can perform basic operation like streaming and browsing without having to worry about performance issues. It does pose a peril of lagging if you try to run more than a few tabs.</p>
<p>Its miniature figure makes it extremely portable and can slip inside your backpack&nbsp;so slickly you won’t even feel it’s there. The device offers a comfy Chiclet-style keyboard with nice clicky keys&nbsp;and it&nbsp;also has a HD web camera which might not produce the sharpest of images but hey, for a price tag that economical, I’ll say the overall package is worth what you are paying for.</p>

<h3>4. HP ProBook X360 11 G3 EE Touchscreen 2 in 1 Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="http://tidd.ly/5d945689" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3704 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/HP-X360-ProBook-G1-11-inch-Convertible-Laptop.jpg" alt="HP ProBook x360 G3 Convertible Touchscreen 11 Inch Laptop with 128GB SSD" width="474" height="277"></a></p>
<p>If you are willing to buy a best convertible 11 inch laptop for a simple routine but are a little tight on coins, you should definitely consider this laptop on the list. Priced only around $500, the x360 offers a very generous selection of ports, and has a quad core Intel Celeron N4100 CPU.</p>
<p>From the performance perspective, the X360 may feel sluggish at times, especially when burdened with hardcore operations. However, its low-power CPU and 128GB of SSD drive helps to extend its battery life up to 10 hours in video-playback.</p>
<p>The HP ProBook x360 G3 is a compact 11 inch laptop, built with a long, sturdy hinge and a large touchpad but somewhat lacks in a screen quality. Although in all its aspects, the architecture is perfect for its target audience. HP with their X360 model wants to aim millennials looking for a single device for work and play, and this machine is capable of doing just that by staying under a very reasonable budget.</p>
<p>Of course, there are going to be a few trade-offs while taking design aspects&nbsp;that inducted in $1,000+ laptops and bringing them down below $500.&nbsp;Particularly the screen gives away the cheap pricing factor with poor viewing angles.</p>

<h3>5. ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02 Rugged 11 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2m0dtbz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2059 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop.jpg" alt="ASUS Chromebook C202SA-YS02 11.6- Rugged Laptop" width="550" height="608" srcset="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop.jpg 550w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop-271x300.jpg 271w, https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ASUS-Chromebook-C202SA-YS02-11.6-Rugged-Laptop-45x50.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>If you are a stay at home mom or a parent who wants to use a sleek and hi-tech machine, all the while needing durability and sturdiness which makes it kid-friendly, then Asus Chromebook C202SA-YS0 is your go-to laptop. Its rugged design, bundled with a spill-resistant keyboard makes it the best 11 inch laptop for classroom usage as well.</p>
<p>Although several reviews have suggested its sluggish performance while running multiple tabs, I think the <a title="Acer Chromebook R11 Review – A Long-Lasting Compact Convertible Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-chromebook-r11-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acer Chromebook R11</a> is a much better alternative to this laptop in terms of performance if you&#8217;re ready to shed some more dollars. Powered by a 1.6-GHz Intel Celeron N3060 processor with 4GB of built-in RAM, the C202 can’t be titled as a performance powerhouse. Although, it is fine for drafting a few notes and book reports or even spreadsheet manipulation.</p>
<p>But considering the fact you have landed on this page because of your tight budget, features like a long battery life, a modular and of course a ruggedized design with a price tag this cheap sure doesn’t sound like a bad deal.</p>

<p>We are finally able to get our hands on an “affordable” Chromebook with a sylphlike chassis. As for operational capabilities, it is the perfect machine if your usage involves not more than web browsing and indulging in cloud-based content creation. In any other case, you might want to look at other alternatives. The Intel Celeron N3060 processor, might not be the fastest of performers so no sugar coating here. If you are a multi-tasker, you might want to skip this 11 inch laptop.</p>
<p>As for overall aspects, bundled with its appealing looks is an integrated keyboard, along with a solid overall performance and that goes without compromising on battery life. It is not one of the A-grade performers when it comes to processing power or haptic sensitivity but if you are a student who needs to work on research papers and has of course, a limited budget, this is the best 11 inch laptop you can get.</p>

<p>The battery life however, is rated to be not so satisfactory, and can withstand around 4-5 hours of juice while not plugged in. But for a fair price, an attractive, sleek, 11 inch laptop&nbsp;is not a bad place to invest your money.</p>

<h3>9. HP Stream 11-ak1020nr Laptop &#8211; Best 11 Inch Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2oJFJFb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5751 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HP-Stream-11.jpg" alt="HP Stream 11-ak1020nr Laptop" width="550" height="375"></a></p>
<p>This is quite a basic machine, predominantly suitable for students. Why do I say so? Well, there are a couple of reasons, for instance the free Office subscription (limited time only) it comes with along with a ridiculously low price tag, worth only around $200. The SD card slot is the most notable added value as such a reasonable outlay, especially when your usage involves more than a dozen GBs. The performance magnitude is quite good as well, comparatively with other budget laptops in this range, housing a 2.7GHz quad core Intel x5-e8000 processor.</p>
<p>To top it off, the standby battery time it offers and the audio mechanism it is built with, are certainly worth mentioning. Apart from its overall elegant chassis and a slim design, the laptop can be quite an eye-pleaser with the variety of colors it comes with. The only less-than-flattering design aspects are the large bezels and an old-fashioned gradient touch on its base.</p>
<p>To sum it up, nice speakers, highly portable, and above average performance, seems a quite reasonable array of features of this 11 inch notebook considering the price tag that it comes with.</p>

<h3>10. Apple MacBook Air 11 Inch 2015 Model&nbsp;<span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Certified Refurbished</span></h3>

<p>Love Apple products but your tight budget holds you back from yearnings? This is almost the cheapest, and the smallest product in Apple&#8217;s notebook lineup. This ultraportable laptop is largely known due to its tremendous power preservation capabilities, offering a whopping 9+ hours of stand up battery time.</p>
<p>Although, the 11-inch MacBook Air packs a 1.6-GHz Intel Core i5-5250U processor and 4GB of RAM,&nbsp;this upgrade from the 12-inch MacBook is not as impressive as it should be. Mainly because the advancements are quite basic and apart from its exceptional storage and processing capabilities, this machine is a big no no for gaming enthusiasts as the graphics performance is really below the mark and even gaming on Mac doesn&#8217;t seems to be a good idea to me.</p>
<p>May be this is the reason the manufacturers decided to discontinue its production, but nonetheless, with this price tag, it’s a much better alternative than other variants in Apple’s ultrabook lineup and if you find this 11 inch laptop&nbsp;worth your money, you can certainly find its <a title="Refurbished Laptops at Apple" href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/FJVP2LL/A/refurbished-116-inch-macbook-air-16ghz-dual-core-intel-core-i5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">refurbished or used models</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, you must have learned about <a title="HP gives a boost to their Elite 800 notebooks with SureSense and advanced privacy features" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/hp-gives-boost-elite-800-notebooks-suresense-advanced-privacy-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP&#8217;s Elitebook upgrades</a> but that&#8217;s not all HP is up to. Their already top of the line business machines the ZBooks are now powered with even improved hardware and endowed with high build quality.</p>
<p>The new upgrades involve the 14U and 15U G6 workstations, named for their 14 and 15.6-inch screen sizes. But that is the only major difference between them. The insides are assembled with eighth-generation Intel CPU with tons of variants to choose from. Starting at the Core i5-8265U, and going all the way up to the i7-8665U. Storage options go from 128GB to 2TB of SSD while you can configure the machines with 32GB of DDR4 memory, an AMD WX 3200 graphics if you are in pursuit of 3D rendering.</p>
<p>Now all this might not be packed in the exterior that you imagine but trust me, do not let the skinny frame fool you. Their contemporary aluminium chassis can withstand much more than traditional &#8216;durable&#8217; machines. HP has managed to make these brawny enough to pass 19 MIL-STD tests so the professional users do not have to worry about travelling with them in unpleasant weather conditions. However, their gauntness did take a toll on the port selection. You will only find a USB 3.0 port, an RJ-45 Ethernet input, a Thunderbolt port, an HDMI and headphone jack in the selection. HP also sacrificed the U-Series Intel chips for H-series which might not be able to live up to the typical workstation laptop performance. But let&#8217;s hope that the Core-i7 processors and the extensive storage make up for the shortfall.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>You may like to read: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Laptops Powered by Intel Core i7 Processor of 2019</a></strong></em></p>
<p>An exciting upgrade is the 4K screen option, offering remarkable 400 nits of brightness. You can also take things up a notch with 1080p screen alternatives and a variety of other options including protective glass anti-glare coatings, and touch support. The 14U and 15U are packed with 50-watt-hour and 56-watt-hour batteries respectively, delivering up to 14 hours per charge. This might not seem as impressive to business professionals for a mobile workstation but the fast charging feature offers a ray of hope. And yes, HP has made sure to add Sure View in Zbooks as well to block out unwanted eyes and prying co-workers.</p>
<p>Weighing just a litter under 4 pounds, the Zbooks aren&#8217;t really breaking barriers in the &#8216;lightweight&#8217; area but specs like Wi-Fi 6, LTE advanced and Bluetooth kind of takes the attention away from its minor shortcomings.</p>
<p>HP is yet to disclose the price of these workstation ultrabooks but we&#8217;ll sure know it before May 27 which is when the devices will be available for purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HP has worked through and through on their Elite 800 series notebooks and have come up with not just refined functionalities but have equipped the new editions with over the charts hardware as well.</p>
<h3>Improved malware protection</h3>
<p>More specifically, HP&#8217;s clamshell designed EliteBook 830 G6, EliteBook 840 G6, EliteBook 850 G6 and the convertible EliteBook x360 830 G6 are getting an upgrade. Starting with the most notable one, the Sure Sense technology. If you are not familiar with the concept, Sure Sense is an advanced malware detection program that works alongside Windows Defender.</p>
<p>HP recognized Sure Sense as a cutting edge technology instead of just another anti-virus due to its light footprint on your machine. HP claims that running Sure Sense won&#8217;t choke your system&#8217;s arteries and would work seamlessly even without an active internet connection. These are alongside Sure Sense&#8217;s obvious characteristics: lightweight performance capabilities, ability to flag known and unknown ransomware and HP Sure Click. Sure Click will be the system&#8217;s defence mechanism which sandboxes browser tabs and allows you to browse untrusted websites and open suspicious attachments in a protected virtual environment.</p>
<h3>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new with the hardware</h3>
<p>HP has equipped the EliteBook 830 G6, HP EliteBook 840 G6, and HP EliteBook 850 G6, and the HP EliteBook x360 830 G6 with a privacy shutter to save you from prying eyes, a whopping 18 hour battery backup, and a 1,000-nit screen.</p>
<p>The Elitebook 830 G6 and EliteBook x360 830 G6 will come with a Core i3-8145U additional option while Core i5-8265U and Core i7-8565 Whiskey Lake processor options are common for all four editions in this lineup. The options of memory go up to 32GB for RAM and up to 512GB for SSD storage.</p>
<div id="attachment_5513" style="width: 1227px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5513" class="size-full wp-image-5513" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HP-Elitebook-800-Series-Notebooks.jpg" alt="HP Elitebook 800 Series Notebooks" width="1217" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-5513" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit &#8211; HP</em></p></div>
<p>The editions vary in screen sizes as well. The EliteBook 830 G6 and x360 830 G6 will come with 13.3-inch displays. Whereas the 840 G6 rocks a 14-inch panel and the 850 G6 is a 15-inch laptop. You can also get additional custom specs with the 14-inch EliteBook 840 G6 and 15.6-inch EliteBook 850 G6 and add a Radeon RX 550 GPU. So there are a lot of options to go about here.</p>
<p>The EliteBook G6 however, has been specially blessed by HP with an embedded touch sensor and an in-built webcam cover. However, the EliteBook x360 830 will star an anti-glare, glossy or Sure View touchscreen display.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s left</h4>
<p>Elitebooks in 2019, will have full support for 4G LTE data connectivity, the latest Wi-Fi 6 standards, Bluetooth 5 and HP&#8217;s Extended Range Wireless LAN technology. One thing we know here for certain is that the Elitebooks will leave no room for a patchy, disruptive browsing experience and will ensure reliable connectivity to other peripherals as well.</p>
<p>While little is known about the pricing of Elitebooks, but we can most certainly be sure that they won&#8217;t be cheap. The Elitebooks will start hitting the shelves in May with only x360 830 G6 to be available in June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who is familiar with HP&#8217;s laptop categories would know that their Envy series is the most reasonable and accessible one. Considering that it sits right between their premium Spectre laptops and their lower end Pavilion series. But those were facts till 2018.</p>
<p>HP has recently worked on their Envy series to meet the standards of Spectre laptops and has introduced features like upgraded processors, a webcam privacy switch (that cuts off the power to the camera), fingerprint reader, wake-on voice, Sure View and built-in support for Alexa for some as well. There are noticeable hardware upgrades as will like slimmer bezels and reduced weightage.</p>
<p>But that is not even the best part. Even with these premium specs, HP has still managed to keep their price range below $1000 which is considered to be the minimum price benchmark of premium laptops.</p>
<h2>HP Envy 13 and HP Envy 17 &#8211; the non-convertibles</h2>
<p>Featuring Intel Core 8th-generation<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/07/intel-announces-six-new-ninth-generation-core-processors/"> </a>processors the HP Envy 13 and Envy 17 with no reversible hinges are traditional laptops receiving the 2019 upgrades.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5414" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-13.jpg" alt="New HP Envy 13 " width="418" height="355" />The HP Envy 13 has been revamped to shed a few pounds and inches too. Remodeled to be 0.2 mm thinner and 0.03 pounds lighter than its 2018 counterpart. HP has also blessed this one with a Left hinge that extends the bottom of its lid to bump up the keyboard for easy typing. What I like best about this remodeling is that we won&#8217;t be suffering from the loss of USB Type A ports due to the slim body. HP has come up with a &#8216;drop jaw&#8217; design that let you connect USB supported devices by simply pulling down a flap. The complete set of ports include USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C, two  USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a headset jack, and a microSD card reader.</p>
<p>For the Envy 13, HP claims that its 53 Wh battery is capable of providing 16 hours of backup which sounds a little on the &#8216;too good to be true&#8217; area. The processors can go up to Intel Core i7-8565U, an 8GB DDR4-2400 memory (onboarded and not upgradeable) and a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5415" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-17.jpg" alt="HP Envy 17 2019" width="442" height="376" />The Envy 17 might interest some gamers due to its NVIDIA&#8217;s GeForce MX250 graphics on board. As there is more room on this one, HP has loaded the Envy 17 with 12GB of RAM, 32GB of Intel Optane memory, and a 512GB PCie NVMe solid state drive. Also blessed with thinner bezels, the Envy 17 is estimated to be 45% slimmer than its 2018 version.</span></p>
<p>The display on both these models comes with a 1980 x 1080 touch screen alongside a backlit keyboard and stereo B&amp;O speakers. Color variety of these includes Pale Gold, Natural Silver, and Nightfall Black shades. Both are expected to be available by April starting from $899.</p>
<h2 style="font-style: normal; line-height: 41.6px;">HP Envy x360 13 and Envy x360 15 &#8211; the convertibles</h2>
<p>The Envy x360 15 and Envy x360 15 are the classic convertibles which can be molded into a tablet or into tent mode by the rotating hinge. While the HP Envy 13 and Envy 17 might pique the interest of students and gamers, these two are most likely suitable for arts and graphics enthusiasts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5416" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-x360-13.jpg" alt="HP Envy x360 13 2019" width="394" height="259" />The Envy x360 13 will be using an AMD&#8217;s 2nd-gen Ryzen processor, can deliver up to 14.5 hours of battery backup, includes up to 1TB of SSD storage and up to 16GB of RAM. The ports selection will boast two USB 3.1 Type-A ports along with a USB-C input and a headphone jack. This one is just 0.6 inches thick and weighs only 2.9 pounds. That is the most we know about the Envy x360 13.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5417" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HP-Envy-x360-15.jpg" alt="HP Envy x360 - 2019" width="438" height="232" />Now the x360 15 is a whole other story. It comes with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors and AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 5 or 7 processors so there are plenty of options to go about here. There is 8GB of RAM and the most basic configuration has a 256GB SSD while the higher-end model is boosted with 512GB of storage. The screen res remains the same throughout each config that is a 1980 x 1080 15.6 inch touchscreen with tiny bezels. There are a lot of other amenities too like quad speakers tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen, and a backlit keyboard with a num keypad. Battery backup is claimed to be 13 hours approx depending upon the usage. The notebook measures 14.1 inches to 9.7 inches and 0.7 inches &#8211; weighing just about 4.5 pounds. The ports selection includes a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, an HDMI port, and a headset jack and an SD card reader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are well aware of Acer&#8217;s TravelMate X3410&#8217;s popularity. Lauded largely for its affordable price, portability and its compatibility with business users. Now just after a couple of months, Acer has come up with its upgraded model &#8211; the Acer TravelMate X514-51. The company has been referring the latest release as their &#8220;lightest and thinnest professional notebook&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>Acer is rooting for this laptop to appeal to travelers and, business professionals. The category of users who are always on their feet, hence their emphasis on it being the lightest and thinnest notebook.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>
<p>Well, technically the TravelMate X514-51 comes with the same thickness as the TravelMate X3410 but is &#8216;lighter&#8217; in a sense that it weighs just 2.1 pounds vs. the 3.7 pounds X3410. The chopped of pounds ultimately means losing a few key features as well, which in this case is the full-sized SD reader and legacy VGA port.</p>
<p>The TravelMate X514-51 boasts a magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminum alloy chassis which makes it possible for durability and portability to coexist. However, do not be fooled by its spindly body as even with a small form factor, Acer has managed to pack it with a fair amount of power.</p>
<p>Inside this Windows 10 laptop, you will find up to 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processors, up to 512GB of SSD storage, and up to 16GB of RAM with a 14-inch FHD 1080p touch display. There is also a backlit keyboard, a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello alongside a 720p webcam. Acer claims that apart from the TravelMate being light on the body and hefty on the specs, the laptop can give up to 10 hours of battery backup. Of course, it sounds highly unlikely, but we can&#8217;t be certain until we actually review the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_5393" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-image-5393 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Acer-TravelMate-X5-2019.jpg" alt="Acer TravelMate X5 - 2019" width="857" height="536" /><p id="caption-attachment-5393" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer TravelMate X5</strong> | Image &#8211; Acer</em></p></div>
<p>What we felt they left out of the equation was any mention of Nvidia or AMD GPU options and port selection. Some of the things the manufacturer let go of while building the small form factor of the machine we suspect. However, we do see a USB Type-A port in the pictures of the laptop which I assume is essential in business laptops.</p>
<h3>Price and Availability</h3>
<p>A little pricier than the TravelMate X3410, the TravelMate X514-51 will be rolled out in June, starting at $1,099.99. This price will buy you a Core i5, 8GB DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB SSD. You can always bump it up with a Core i7, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM, and up to a 512GB SSD.</p>

The Chromebook variant is equipped with AMD’s dual-core A4-9120C all-in-one chip (APU), same RAM an the sibling but storage going up to just 64 GBs. Now what makes this Chromebook enterprise friendly as the specs are completely customizable according to each user&#8217;s specific needs. There is also the spill proof technology that makes it resistant to rough classroom usage.</p>
<p>To power the 14e Chromebook, Lenovo’s has loaded this laptop with a 57Wh battery delivering up to 10 hours of backup. The ports selection on the 14e includes two USB-C ports, two USB-A, a MicroSD card slot, and a 3.5mm audio combo port. An interesting addition in this affordable notebook is the 180-degree hinge that lets you lay flat the Chromebook on a table for shared presentations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the midst of MWC 2019, Lenovo is taking huge leaps for upgrading their ThinkPad lineup. The laptop giant Lenovo, announced their latest additions &#8211; the X390, and X390 Yoga to the ThinkPad portfolio.</p>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390</h3>
<p>Lenovo has bumped up the display from 12 to a 13-inch, but the best part is that the overall form factor of the device has not been compromised. As expected in 2019, Lenovo has introduced 50% slimmer bezels which has resulted in an even slimmer machine than before, rounding to 0.6 inches thin and weighing just 2.7 pounds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5322" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Launched-at-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Launched at MWC 2019" width="700" height="517" /></p>
<p>Inside, there is an 8th Gen Intel Core vPro i7 processor, up to 32GB of RAM, and storage goes up to 1TB. The ports selection on the ThinkPad X390 includes a Thunderbolt 3, a USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1, an HDMI input slot, a microSD card slot, alongside a Kensington lock, and a single jack for mic and headset connectivity. Lenovo has also promised for the laptop to deliver up to 17 hours of power backup and also introduced some nifty security features. Like the PrivacyGuard that utilizes the built-in IR camera to detect snoopers behind you- enabling alerts and using the ThinkShutter to tone down the brightness for prying eyes only.</p>
<p>The screen options on the ThinkPad X390 include a basic 13.3-inch, 1080p touch display with 300 nits of brightness and a 13.3-inch, 1080p PrivacyGuard non-touch alternative with 400 nits brightness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Top Picks of Laptops For Writers</a> &#8211; With Most Comfortable Keyboard</strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga</h3>
<p>Now, Lenovo&#8217;s Yoga series has been a portable marvel for all travelers and on-the-run kind of consumers. Its refreshing to see that alongside the X390, the X390 Yoga is also getting a boost. Toning down an already slim screen, the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 will be 2 percent thinner to 9.6 inches and 5 percent lighter to just 2.9 lbs from its previous version.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5323" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X390-Yoga-MWC-2019.jpg" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga - MWC 2019" width="815" height="500" /></p>
<p>The only display option on the Yoga X390 is a 13.3 inch display, 1080p IPS touch screen and 300 nits of brightness. Such neat specs really doesn&#8217;t let you miss the lack of variety in it.</p>
<p>With the same processing capacity and storage as its sibling, the Yoga X390 can only be bumped up to 16 GB of RAM. The battery life is also toned down and can go up to just 14.5 hours. With an integrated HD Graphics 620 GPU, the ports gallery on this one remains the same as the ThinkPad X390. What&#8217;s unique in this one is the <strong>LTE connectivity</strong> (with the Wi-Fi 6 protocol that has been configured into both models) and a stylus pen that seems like an essential for all portables. But the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga X390 does lack the PrivacyGuard feature without losing the HD camera and the ThinkShutter cover.</p>
<p>However, both sibling share the dual far-field noise-canceling microphones, delivering top-notch voice output during conferencing and while using smart assistants.</p>
<p>Both laptops are expected to hit the shelves in May. The ThinkPad X390 is starting from $1,099, and the Yoga variant from $1,359.</p>
