										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaming on a big screen laptop often means added weight. This is something that we have seen in the past few years, but the new Alienware m17 offers a 17-inch screen and impressive performance without the extra weight. In fact, it is 40% lighter than the Alienware 17 and weighs only 5.79 lbs. This is very impressive indeed for a laptop that does not compromise on performance and offers a <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17-inch display</a>.</p>
<p>Powering the laptop is an Intel 8th-gen Intel Core i9 processor and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q GPUs. Both of these are based on the latest architectures and will provide impressive performance even in a laptop form factor. Dell claims to be using an exceptional cooling solution in order to keep the hardware cool under load, but that is something that we will have to see for ourselves before we can make a comment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5056 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/m17-4-700x467-c.jpg" alt="Alienware m17" width="700" height="467" />The Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Max-Q GPUs are designed for thin and light gaming laptops and have a lower TDP, but they offer the same features as the standard versions. So not only are you getting Nvidia RTX real-time ray tracing support but DLSS as well. The Alienware m17 will be available in Epic Silver and Nebula Red. Even though the device is thin and light, it is strong and durable due to the use of premium materials like magnesium alloy and copper.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5074" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/alienware-m17-launch-ces-2019.jpg" alt="alienware m17 launch ces 2019" width="612" height="425" /></p>
<p>The company has also given a specs bump to its first-ever thin and light gaming laptop — <a title="Alienware m15 – The First Thin and Light Alienware Gaming Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/alienware-m15-first-thin-light-gaming-laptop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alienware m15</a> which was launched in October last year. You can now configure it with up to Intel Core i9 processor and new Nvidia RTX 20 series graphics.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the Alienware&#8217;s new 17-inch thin and light gaming laptop and whether or not this is something that you would be interested in getting for yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acer has just announced its first Chromebook that is based on the AMD A-series processor that feature Radeon graphics. Acer is well-known for introducing very competitive Chromebooks in the past, and now Acer is adding AMD powered devices to the portfolio with the Acer Chromebook 315, which will give customers more flexibility.</p>
<p>The Acer Chromebook 315 will be powered by the entry-level 7th Gen AMD A6-9220C or A4-9120C processors, which come with Radeon graphics. The chips allow the user to have multiple tabs open and enables better multi-tasking with the help of superior performance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4977 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer_Chromebook_315_06_575px.jpg" alt="AMD A-Series Processor Powered Chromebook" width="678" height="422" /></p>
<p>The Chromebook also comes with a Full HD 15.6-inch IPS display and you can choose the touchscreen option if that is what you are interested in. The company claims that the Chromebook will be able to last up to 10 hours on a single charge which is very impressive indeed, but these numbers are under particular conditions. I am guessing that with proper use, it will be able to deliver 7-8 hours which is still pretty decent.</p>
<p>It has two front-facing speakers, which should sound great. Speakers should always be front facing but this is not a feature that we see in most laptops, and I think that companies should do something about it. This is a pretty big device, so you get a full backlit keyboard too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4975 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer_Chromebook_315_02_575px.jpg" alt="AMD A-Series Processor Powered Chromebook" width="678" height="479" /></p>
<p>The device comes with two USB Type-C Gen 1 ports, but if you have older peripherals, then you need not worry as the Chromebook also has two USB 3.0 ports. You also have the headphone jack, support for WiFi 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth 4.2.</p>
<p>The Chromebook 315 will come with 8 GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It is expected to release in February, and the pricing starts at $279.99.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the Acer Chromebook 315 and whether or not this is something that you might be interested in getting for yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/lg-new-2-in-1-and-17-inch-gram-laptop-rumors/">talked earlier</a> about LG working on a new Gram 2-in-1 device that would be shown off at CES 2019. It seems that we were right and even though the product is &#8220;coming soon&#8221; according to the <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/laptops/lg-14T990-UAAS8U1-ultra-slim-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a>, the LG Gram 2-in-1 is available for purchase at some retailers such as <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-gram-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-solid-state-drive-dark-silver/6318179.p?skuId=6318179" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BestBuy</a>.</p>
<p>The new LG Gram 2-in-1 comes with new hardware and is powered by the new Intel 8th generation processors. The new processors are based on the Whiskey Lake architecture. It is worth noting that even though the new LG Gram 2-in-1 is a versatile machine that can be used as a laptop and a tablet, there is no 4K option for the screen. The display is only 14-inches, and the screen size is not enough to appreciate 4K resolution, which might be the reason why LG is not offering the option.</p>
<p>The new LG Gram 2-in-1 comes with Gorilla Glass 5 and a 360° hinge design, but there are some drawbacks. The new model is 0.1 inches thicker than the previous one. The 2-in-1 weighs 2.53 pounds compared to the older one that weighed just 2.13 pounds. The difference is a minor one and is not a dealbreaker. I am sure that most users won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4944 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/LG-Gram-2-in-1-in-standard-position.jpg" alt="LG Gram 2-in-1 in standard position" width="650" height="494" /></p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that even with the additional weight the device is still lighter than the 2018 Apple MacBook Air. Gram laptops are known for being some of the lightest on the market, and that is something that we are going to see in 2019 as well.</p>

<p>Talking about the battery life of the device, LG claims that it will last 21 hours, but that is under very specific conditions. We will have to test the device to see what the battery life is actually like, but if I were to venture a guess, I would say that it would last around 12-14 hours which is very decent indeed.</p>
<p>The device comes with a stylus which can be used to take advantage of the touchscreen. The stylus has 4096 levels of pressure and has tilt detection to give you a more natural feel when writing. LG claims that the stylus batteries will last up to 18 months which is very impressive even if they last a year.</p>

<p>The new LG Gram 2-in-1 is available right now for $1500, and for the money you get the Intel Whiskey Lake Core i7-8565U CPU, 512GB of M.2 SSD for storage, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1080p display. That might seem like a lot of money for a laptop, but you are paying for the portability and the lightweight. Not to mention the high-end specifications as well.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the new LG Gram 2-in-1 and whether or not this is something that you might be interested in buying for yourself.</p>

It is a competitively priced entry-level laptop from Acer which does not pack much power, but if all you need to do is browse the internet, work on documents and consume content online, this laptop can check all those boxes, and it will not break the bank while doing that.</p>
<p>Here we are going to have an in-depth look at the Acer Aspire 1 (A114-32-C1YA). I will be going through different aspects of the device, talking about the pros and cons as well as the things that I personally liked or disliked during my time with this laptop.</p>

<p>As you can see in the specs, the Acer Aspire 1 is powered by the Intel Celeron N4000 dual-core processor, which is based on Gemini Lake. The CPU has a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz and can boost to 2.6 GHz. The chip also comes with 4 MB of L2 cache. This is the same CPU that you get in the HP Stream 14. Other than that, you get 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage.</p>
<p>With that said, let&#8217;s begin with our review of Acer Aspire 1, talking about each aspect of the laptop, one by one.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Aspire 1 is an entry-level laptop from Acer, so there isn&#8217;t really anything fancy about the design but it is still a robust machine, and overall it is very clean. The exterior of the laptop looks stylish, especially the brushed aluminum finish on the lid with silver Acer logo in the center. On opening the lid, you&#8217;ll find the same finish around the keyboard and touchpad area as well. While there is nothing to brag about the design of this laptop, it manages not to look cheap.</p>
<div id="attachment_4885" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-image-4885 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Textured-Lid.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Textured Lid" width="700" height="525" /><p id="caption-attachment-4885" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Brushed Aluminum Finish on the Lid</strong></em></p></div>
<p>However, there are certain design flaws on this laptop, and one of them is its bad speaker placement. The laptop has two speakers at the bottom, one on either side, and its poor placement muffled the sound everytime I used the laptop from my lap. If we talk about the sound quality, then it isn&#8217;t that great either. Its two speakers do get loud enough to fill the small-sized room, but I felt a lack of clarity while listening to music. But, considering that this is a $200 laptop, some sacrifice needed to be made, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Talking about the internal design, getting to the internals of this laptop was very hard. I had to open fifteen screws and had to pull the back panel off to gain access to the parts, but that&#8217;s fine because there are no upgradable parts inside the laptop. The RAM and storage drive is soldered on the motherboard, and that makes users stuck with its low 4GB of RAM which kind of bottlenecks its overall performance (more on this later). Moreover, the internal design is fanless so you won&#8217;t be hearing any fan noise when you use the device.</p>
<div id="attachment_4886" style="width: 677px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-image-4886 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Internal-Design.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Internal Design" width="667" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-4886" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Internal Design | RAM Soldered on Motherboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall the Acer Aspire 1 has decent build quality. The materials used do not feel like this is an entry-level device. The texture on the lid adds to the premiums of the laptop, and the laptop not only looks impressive but feels great as well. The device is pretty light, and you can easily take it with you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for College Students for Every Budget and College Major</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h4>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h4>
<p>There are a couple of useful ports on this laptop that make it great for the price. You get an ethernet port that will allow you to plug in an ethernet cable if you want faster internet speeds and do not want to rely on a wireless connection. You also have an HDMI output port that will deliver 4K at 30 FPS. On the left, you have a USB 3.0 port to transfer data faster. You also get an SD card slot, but the card sticks out which can be an issue if you were looking to expand laptop&#8217;s limited storage with the SD card.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4887" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Left-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) - Left Side Ports" width="700" height="452" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you have the combo jack for headphones and two more USB 2.0 ports. These are slower ports that can be used to connect a mouse or other devices that do not require higher throughput.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Right-Side-Ports.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="382" /></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, so you will be able to take advantage of high-speed internet and routers that use 5 GHz frequencies. The laptop also offers Bluetooth 4.1 which can be used to connect wireless devices like a mouse or a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The display on the Aspire 1 is a 14-inch TN panel which does not offer great viewing angles, and as expected it isn&#8217;t color accurate either. The bright side is that while the screen is the same size as the HP Stream 14, it has a higher resolution. That said, the Acer Aspire 1 is the only laptop in this price segment to offer full HD display making it the perfect budget option for binge watchers.</p>
<div id="attachment_4890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-image-4890 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-Display-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 - Display Review" width="800" height="637" /><p id="caption-attachment-4890" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>14-inch Full HD Matte Display</strong></em></p></div>
<p>The screen is a bit dim, but it has a matte coating on top which does a great job of reducing reflections while using this laptop in well-lit areas. Overall, it is a pretty decent panel keeping in mind that this laptop costs just a little <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than $200</a>.</p>
<p>Another exciting feature is that the screen can be rotated more than 180 degrees. The Acer Aspire 1 is in no means a 2-in-1 device, so I do not really know what Acer is trying to do with this feature, but you can have the screen flat on a surface if you want. The hinge does have a bit of range, and that might keep the screen from snapping off.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 14-inch Laptops</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Keyboard And Touchpad</h3>
<p>The keyboard on the Acer Aspire 1 is very impressive, the keys have ample travel, and they are decent to type on. The keys are also a bit larger than usual which is great for typing. The only issue is that the placement of some keys can take a bit of getting used to. You will need to adjust to the arrangement of the small arrow keys and the buttons next to the Enter and Backspace keys. This is not a major issue, and once you have used the device for a few hours, you should get used to it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Review-Keyboard-and-Touchpad.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Keyboard and Touchpad Review" width="750" height="590" /></p>
<p>The keyboard is much better than some previous <a title="All Acer Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/acer-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acer laptops</a> that we have used in the past, and the overall design is decent. The touchpad is not all that great though. It is a bit wobbly, but it will get the job done. It uses Windows Precision drivers and supports gestures as well. Compared to the HP Stream 14, the keyboard is fine, but the touchpad could have been better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 8 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks of Laptops for Writers with Comfortable Keyboards</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Webcam</h3>
<p>The webcam on the Aspire 1 is another thing after speakers that Acer has compromised to price it competitively. Acer has fitted a very bad webcam on this laptop which produces an unacceptable picture and video quality, even as per the budget laptop standards. The picture that I took of mine with its webcam came out entirely out of focus, grainy and with vanished colors.</p>
<p>So, if you have to make a lot of video calls everyday or attend the video conferences, then this is not the right laptop for you unless you are ready to spend a bit extra for an <a title="External Webcams on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LH16yf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">external webcam</a>.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The laptop comes with Windows 10 in S mode which is excellent for students and individuals who need added security. For uninitiated, the S mode limits the third party apps that you can download, and you can only use apps that are verified by Microsoft and are available on the official Microsoft store. Well, if you don&#8217;t like it, opting out of the S mode is not an issue, and you can move to regular Windows 10 Home with just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-A114-32-C1YA-Software-and-Warranty-Review.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 A114-32-C1YA - Software and Warranty Review" width="735" height="550" /></p>
<p>Along with Window 10, there are a couple of other apps and games as well that come pre-installed. These include the Candy Crush Saga, Candy Crush Friends Saga, Cooking Fever, Township, Royal Revolt 2, Fitbit Coach, Photastic Collage, ACG player and Amazon. All these apps can be uninstalled, so it&#8217;s not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The laptop also comes with a free year of Office 365 and the Acer Product registration app which you will need to register your device, check the warranty and get customer support.<br />

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Acer Aspire 1 is a netbook with the dual-core processor and 4GB of RAM, so I did not have high hopes when testing the device and it seems that I was right for the most part. The 4 GB of RAM is a major limitation, and it took only four Chrome tabs to get the device to slow down. With eight tabs open in Chrome and one of them playing a YouTube video, there was a noticeable lag when typing.</p>
<p>While this is not a <a title="Gaming Laptop Buying Guides" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming machine</a>, we did play Asphalt 9 on the device, and it ran well. There was no noticeable lag, but then again, the game is very well optimized and will even run on smartphones. We also tried Cooking Fever that came pre-installed, and that ran fine as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Real-Life-Performance.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Real Life Performance" width="527" height="700" /></p>
<p>As far as thermals are concerned, the device’s bottom does get a bit warm even while normal multi-tasking possibly because of its fanless design. It can be problematic for users like me who like to use the laptop by keeping it on the lap. However, it was completely usable when kept on the table, and its keyboard and palm rest area didn’t show any signs of heat which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Acer Aspire 1 isn&#8217;t great when it comes to multitasking and although it will run games found on the official store just fine, you cannot expect to play games on it. Opening multiple apps or even Chrome tabs will slow it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>Recommended: <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i3 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Budget Laptops Powered by Intel Core i3 Processor</a></strong></em></div></div>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>The claimed battery life of the 2018 Acer Aspire 1 is around 6.5 hours, and in our tests, it managed to last for 7 hours and 12 minutes which is decent, but there are options in the market that will give you 8-9 hours of battery backup. That is a factor worth considering if you are someone who has to rely a lot on battery power every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, the laptop took 2 hours and 17 minutes to charge from 0 to 100% which is also a little longer than the other laptops. So, the battery on the Acer Aspire 1 takes its time to charge and does not offer much in terms of battery life either.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#d5d5d5;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#efefef;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops Under $200 &#8211; Our Most Recommended Inexpensive Laptops</a></strong></em> </div></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4895 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Acer-Aspire-1-2018-Laptop-Review-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="Acer Aspire 1 (2018) Laptop Review - Featured Image" width="650" height="483" /></p>
<p>One of the strongest points of the Acer Aspire 1 is its 14-inch full HD display which makes hard to find a substitute for this laptop. Moreover, it offers plenty of ports and comes with modern wireless connectivity options so that you can take advantage of high-speed internet and connect your wireless devices. Although its speakers lack in clarity and have an awful webcam, one cannot go wrong with it considering it costs just $250.</p>
<p>So, overall the Acer Aspire 1 is a solid laptop for the price if you consume content online or work with documents. It can handle some mobile games that are available on the Microsoft store and is a well-built machine overall. The storage and RAM are the limiting factors, but if all you need is a device on which you can create documents, browse the web and watch movies, then this is one of the best inexpensive laptops right now that will get the job done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want a laptop that is thin, light, has a premium build, quad-core processor and dedicated graphics then a MacBook Pro is what comes to mind, but even when you spend $1800, you do not get the dedicated graphics. That is where the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth comes in and checks all those boxes.</p>
<p>The Blade Stealth has been on the market for some time now and each year Razer introduces some tweaks to make it better. While it was always a thin and light laptop, it was never considered a gaming PC without the Razer core external GPU enclosure that costs extra.</p>
<p>While the base model does still come with an integrated graphics, you can get the mid-range version that offers a quad-core CPU and the Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics. While the performance might not be on par with the <a title="Razer Blade 15 Gets Affordable Base Model and New White Color Option" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/razer-blade-15-gets-affordable-model-new-white-color-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently launched 15-inch model</a>, it is still much better than the Intel&#8217;s integrated graphics. One thing to note here is that this is not the standard MX150 GPU, but a powerful version that has a 25W TDP and comes with 4GB of GDDR5 memory. This provides some serious on-the-go gaming and video editing performance.</p>
<p>Fortnite can be played at 1080p on the medium preset with 45-60 FPS on average. Call of Duty Black Ops 4 is also playable if you lower the graphics to the low preset. The game runs at 45-50 FPS and you could get stable 60 FPS if you lowered the resolution even further.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4748" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Gaming-on-2019-Razer-Blade-Stealth.jpg" alt="Gaming on 2019 Razer Blade Stealth" width="750" height="580" /></p>
<p>The new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth is powered by the new Intel Whiskey Lake i7-8565U processor and it can be configured with up to 16GB of 2133 MHz RAM and 512GB of PCIe M.2 SSD. The new model is better than ever with smaller display bezels, which means that the entire laptop is a little less wide. The Matte Black aluminum finish on the 2019 Stealth is similar to the other Razer laptops, and it is the only color option available right now.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the laptop build quality feels so good is that it is built from a single block of Aluminum. Removing a single screw gets you to the internals of the laptop. There is not much that you can upgrade but you can change the SSD if you want. Inside you see a new thermal design that comes with dual fans to cool the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth that now comes with a dedicated GPU.</p>
<p>The 52Wh battery might not be the biggest in the world but Razer does claim that it will last up to 13 hours which is very impressive indeed. This will depend on the type of work that you are doing on the device, but it should last you 8 hours on average.</p>
<p>The price of the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth is pretty high and the mid-range version <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-stealth/shop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">costs you $1600</a>. This is still cheaper when compared to the MacBook and better than the <a title="Dell XPS 13 (2018) Review – Best Windows Ultrabook Money can Buy" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/dell-xps-13-2018-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell&#8217;s XPS 13</a> which doesn&#8217;t come with dedicated GPU at all.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for a new thin and light laptop that does not compromise on power then the new 2019 Razer Blade Stealth is a great option to consider. Especially if you are looking for a Windows device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EUROCOM Tornado F7W workstation laptop has been announced and the hardware inside is very impressive, to say the least. The laptop is powered by an Intel i9-9900K along with the Nvidia Quadro P5200 graphics card.</p>
<p>That is a lot of power in a laptop form factor. You can also go with a Xeon chip E2100 instead. The laptop also comes with plenty of security features like a fingerprint reader, TPM 2.0 encryption and BIOS encryption. These are some great features to have if you work with sensitive data and projects. If you want even more security then you can also go with the Anti-hacker Protection Kit.</p>
<p>The price of the EUROCOM Tornado F7W has not been officially revealed yet but keeping in mind the power that the laptop has to offer you can expect it to cost more than $3000, at the very least.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4640 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/184634ka9ahgbm9gooob59.jpg.thumb_.jpg" alt="EUROCOM Tornado F7W" width="800" height="640" />The high price is not the only drawback. The device is very thick, which it has to be, to accommodate these high-end parts. It also needs to have ample cooling to keep temperatures in check when under load. All this adds to the weight. The EUROCOM Tornado F7W is 9.127138 pounds, which means that you won&#8217;t be able to carry it for too long.</p>
<p>While the top of the line model comes with the Intel i9-9900K or Xeon E2100, you can also choose from the  i7 8700, i7 8700K, i7 8086K and i7 9700K CPUs. The laptop has 4 slots for memory and you can add up to 128 GB of RAM which should be more than plenty for what you have planned.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are plenty of storage options. The device can be configured with 2 HDDs, 3 M.2 NVME SSDs and 2 SATA SSDs. That is a lot of storage and should be plenty to meet your needs. On the graphics side of things, you can also configure the laptop with the Quadro P3200 6 GB or P4200 8 GB.</p>
<p>The EUROCOM Tornado F7W is a great workstation laptop. The two major downsides are that the laptop is going to cost a lot of money and that it is bulky. If you need a lot of power and also require portability then this could be the solution that you are looking for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2018 Retina MacBook Air was <a title="New 2018 Apple MacBook Air With Retina Display Announced" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/new-2018-apple-macbook-air-announced/">announced a while back</a> and here we have some numbers that show how well it performs as compared to the previous model. Geekbench tests show that the Retina MacBook Air with Core i5 processor was able to score about 4200 points in the single-core test and around 7800 points in the multi-core tests.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous model, the new 2018 Retina MacBook Air performs 27% better in the single-core test and 28% better in the multi-core test. While this is a synthetic benchmark, it does show us that the new MacBook Air is a significant upgrade over the previous generation model.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Air also performs better than the 12-inch MacBook. The MacBook Air performs 20% better in single-core tests and 17% better in multi-core tests. Moving on to the mid-2017 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar, which scored 4314 points in the single-core test and is 16% faster when comparing multi-core performance. You need to note that this model is $100 more expensive than the new MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro is able to score 16464 in the multi-core test and 4504 points in the single-core test. While the single-core performance is pretty close to the 2018 Retina MacBook Air, the Pro model has more cores and is able to beat the Air in the multi-core test.</p>
<p>This is a synthetic benchmark so you need to take this with a grain of salt. This might not translate too well into real-world performance. But it does provide an insight into what you can expect. This is also a leak and you should wait until the MacBook Air is released so that third-parties can do their own tests.</p>
<p>If these numbers are indeed true then that means that the 2018 Retina MacBook Air is a pretty solid laptop. Especially when compared to the older model. If you have the older model then the new version is a significant upgrade. While the 2018 Retina MacBook Air does seem a bit expensive starting at $1100, it is still the least expensive model that comes with a retina display.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new A12X Bionic chip that Apple has developed is not only the fastest chip that Apple has brought to market but it is also able to beat rival laptops. This is very impressive keeping in mind that the 2018 iPad Pro is a tablet rather than a full-fledged laptop.</p>
<p>Leaked iPad Pro benchmarks show that the new device is able to beat <a title="Top 10 Best Intel Core i7 Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i7 powered laptops</a> like the <a title="Dell XPS 13 (2018) Review – Best Windows Ultrabook Money can Buy" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/dell-xps-13-2018-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell XPS 13</a> and Apple MacBook Pro. <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/10567048" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Geekbench test</a> mentions an iPad 8.8 which seems to be the 2018 iPad Pro that comes with 1TB of storage and 6GB of RAM.</p>
<p>According to the 2018 iPad Pro benchmarks, the device was able to score 5030 points in the single-core test and 17995 points in the multi-core test. This is very impressive keeping in mind that the 8th Gen Intel Core i7-based 13-inch MacBook Pro scored 17,348 points in the multi-core benchmark. The iPad Pro also beats the XPS 13 that scored 14,180. The XPS 13 is powered by the Core i7-8550U.</p>
<p>While the margin between the 2018 iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro is small, there is a significant difference when compared to the XPS 13. You can check out the iPad Pro benchmark below:</p>
<div id="attachment_4541" style="width: 1086px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4541" class="wp-image-4541 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2132132.png" alt="2018 iPad Pro Benchmarks" width="1076" height="693" /><p id="caption-attachment-4541" class="wp-caption-text">2018 iPad Pro Benchmarks</p></div>
<p>Apple claimed that the A12X Bionic chip in the new 2018 iPad Pro made it more powerful than 92% of all portable PCs and that is what we see here. The numbers are remarkable and it is interesting to see what kind of power Apple can get out of its devices when it uses its own proprietary chips.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the Core i9-based 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro was able to score 23,138. The older A10X Fusion-based 2017 model 12.9-inch iPad Pro scored 9,414 points in Geekbench.</p>
<p>These are leaked numbers so you need to take them with a grain of salt. We have to wait till the 2018 iPad Pro is released so that third-parties can run their tests and find out whether or not these numbers are indeed true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent Apple event lacked updates for the MacBook Pro but Apple has silently announced that the 15-inch MacBook Pro is indeed getting a significant boost in performance. The upcoming MacBook Pro models will come with AMD Vega graphics and this upgrade will boost graphics performance by up to 60%.</p>
<p>The present MacBook Pro can be configured with Radeon Pro 560X graphics but starting next month users will be able to configure the 15-inch MacBooks Pros with the Radeon Pro Vega 16 with 4 GB of HBM2 memory or Radeon Pro Vega 20 with 4 GB of HBM2 memory.</p>
<p>This upgrade is only for the most expensive MacBook Pro with Touch Bar that starts at $2,799. The graphics are based on the 14nm process and one of the perks of using HBM2 memory is that it uses less space as compared to other types of graphics memory. This will allow Apple to increase the graphics performance while keeping the form factor of the MacBook Pro as it is.</p>
<p>All the other configuration options remain the same. These devices will come with the 8th generation Intel CPUs. You can choose to go for an i7 or i9 SKU. These upgraded models will be available starting next month but we do not have the pricing as of right now.</p>
<p>The graphics upgrade will come in handy if you use graphics intensive workloads. This is ideal for anyone that edits videos, works with 3D design or rendering workloads. If you felt that the previous Apple devices did not offer ample performance then there is a more powerful option now that should be able to meet your needs.</p>
<p>While the pricing is not official yet, the increase in graphics performance will come at a significant price bump. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar already costs $2,799 before configuration options. Keeping that in mind, it is safe to assume that you will be paying at least $3000 for the model with AMD Vega graphics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2018 Apple MacBook Air has just been announced with the Retina Display. It&#8217;s not as cheap as we expected to be, though! Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the New MacBook Air that Apple just announced.</p>
<p>The 2018 Apple MacBook Air comes with plenty of new features. The design has changed and if you are among the few people like me who prefers the physical &#8216;Escape&#8217; button over the one on Touch bar, then you will be glad to know that the 2018 Apple MacBook Air does not come with Touch bar!</p>
<h2>Everything That&#8217;s New in 2018 Apple MacBook Air</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4509 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/macbook-air-2018-annoucement.jpg" alt="2018 Apple MacBook Air" width="1595" height="895" />The new MacBook Air is not a refresh, it is not a revamp, it is a new design. Plenty of things are different and here we are going to look into what this much awaited New MacBook Air has to offer.</p>
<h3>Touch ID without Touch bar</h3>
<p>The new MacBook Air comes with Touch ID. Even though this feature has been removed from the latest phones that Apple makes, you will get this feature on this new MacBook. You will be able to unlock your device and make transactions using your fingerprint. Touch ID also activates Hey, Siri which is another great feature.</p>
<h3>All New Design</h3>
<p>The MacBook Air is supposed to be thin and light. The new model is 10% slimmer than the previous one and weighs only 2.75 pounds. This might not be the lightest laptop in the world but it is pretty close. The overall footprint of the device is 17% smaller than the previous model.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4510 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/macbook-air-stage.jpg" alt="2018 Apple MacBook Air" width="1540" height="892" /></p>
<p>The new MacBook Air comes with a bigger trackpad. Compared to the previous model the trackpad is 20% larger. This means more surface area and better productivity. If the tight space provided to you on the older device was an issue, it&#8217;s not going to be a problem now.</p>
<p>The new 2018 MacBook Air also comes with a new keyboard. Apple has upgraded the device with the 3rd generation butterfly switch. This ensures a more ergonomic and silent typing experience.</p>
<h3>Apple MacBook Air Specifications</h3>
<p>A new design is great, Apple has never failed to provide that. What do you get inside? Inside the 2018 MacBook Air, you have the latest Intel 8th Generation dual-core CPUs. You can configure your device with up to 16 GB of RAM, which was not possible in previous models. You can also configure an SSD of up to 1.5 TB.</p>
<p>Moving on to battery life, while we do not have the exact battery capacity for the device, we do know that the device is capable of lasting 12 hours when browsing the web. It can last an additional hour if you are watching a video. This is the claimed battery life but the real world numbers will be a bit different.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the MacBook Air offers two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3. This means that you can connect an external graphics card to the device. One of these ports will be used for charging, so you are not going to connect many devices to it at the same time unless you get third-party solutions.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The base model MacBook Air 2018 comes with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. The price for this configuration is $1,199. While this might seem like an expensive device keeping in mind that this is a MacBook Air, it is the cheapest MacBook with a Retina display.</p>
<h2>The New Mac mini</h2>
<p>Apple has also announced new iPads with Face ID and also refreshed the Mac mini, which is basically a computer without the integrated display and Apple peripherals. The new mini has a similar design but with more ports and it can be configured with up to a 6-core Intel 8th generation CPU, 2TB flash storage and 64GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The base model comes with 8GB of memory, a 3.6 GHz quad-core processor and a 128GB SSD and it starts at $799.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4511 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mac-mini-stage.jpg" alt="2018 Mac Mini" width="1600" height="1056" />The new 2018 Apple MacBook Air seems like a great product and even though it is more expensive when compared to the previous models, it offers plenty of exciting new features including Touch ID, Retina display and most importantly better performance.</p>
<p>The new hardware and the changes in design plus the fact that it comes with a Retina display should be motivation enough for you to upgrade your device. Provided that you are fine with paying the Apple tax.</p>
