Although its chassis is made up of full plastic, it is durable and resistant towards the daily wears and tears.</p>
<p>The display on this laptop is one of the best you can get in 300 dollars price range laptops (actually <a title="Top 10 Best Budget Laptops Under $200" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-cheap-laptops-under-200-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 price-range</a>).

It has a quad-core Intel Pentium N5000 processor inside paired with the 4GB of RAM.</p>

For storage, this laptop provides just 64GB of eMMC storage which is very low&nbsp;and might be deal breaking for&nbsp;some users, but considering the price of this laptop, its&nbsp;specs are justifiable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when you had to spend a hell lot of money to buy a good laptop because now many laptop manufacturers are offering decent performing laptops for the price lesser than $200! They are best for basic everyday tasks, but still, there are many tasks which these cheap laptops can&#8217;t perform. So which are the best laptops under $200? Are the laptops under 200 dollars really worth buying? Let&#8217;s find it out.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span></p>
<p><em>Of course, while buying the budget laptop, you have to keep your expectations in check, but when the budget is $200, you really have to take that seriously!</em></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t expect to play the newest games or perform demanding tasks such as video editing on these budget laptops, because the Windows Netbooks and Chromebooks that you would usually find in this price range are simply not made for it. They run on the lightweight operating systems such as Windows 10 S and Chrome OS and are powered by an entry-level CPUs paired with very less amount of RAM and storage which although can&#8217;t handle demanding workloads, they are perfect for everyday productivity tasks such as surfing the web, editing documents, managing small excel sheets and creating presentations. They also come in a very small and lightweight form factor, and as its less powerful hardware consumes very less power, most of them have good battery life as well.</p>
<p>So, they can be a great option for frequent travelers, students, or anyone who wants an inexpensive laptop for answering emails, editing documents, and other such basic tasks. However, for anything more than that, the sub-$200 laptops will be way underpowered. If you were expecting more from these budget notebooks, then we strongly recommend you to increase your budget and check out other <a title="More Budget Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/budget-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget laptop buying guides</a> on our website which includes more capable laptops that cost just slightly more than $200.</p>
<p>Well, if you think that these budget laptops are what you have been looking for, then as I said earlier, while searching for the best cheap laptops in the market, you will see there are mostly Windows laptops and Chromebooks available to buy under $200 budget. So, the first thing which you have to decide is whether you should buy a Windows laptop or a Chromebook?</p>

	</div><h4 style="text-align: center;">Windows Laptop or Chromebook: What should you buy under $200?</h4>
<hr>
<p>To buy the best and reliable laptop within your limited budget, you have to decide whether Windows laptops&nbsp;are best for your daily needs or Chromebooks. Below are a few comparisons&nbsp;which shall&nbsp;give you a proper idea of what is Chromebook and how it is different from Windows laptop that you&#8217;re probably used to.&nbsp;Go through it and then take your decision for&nbsp;buying the best cheap laptop under 200 dollars for yourself.</p>
<p>If you already know what you&#8217;re looking for then feel free to skip this and begin with the list of our top laptop picks below.</p>
<ul>
<li>As we all know Windows is the most used operating system on computers so getting used to a new windows laptop will be no problem for most of us. Whereas, Chrome OS, on the other hand, is still found on very limited laptops. While getting used to it won&#8217;t be much problem, as its UI is almost similar to using Chrome on Windows laptop but for those who don&#8217;t use Chrome, it can be a bit of work.</li>
<li>There are no software compatibility problems on Windows laptops. You can download apps and games from Microsoft Store and even install software from other third-party sources. On the other hand, Chromebooks are still limited to apps in the Chrome web store. Google added the Android Play Store support to the Chrome OS and many older Chromebooks did get the software update for that, but it is still available on the <a title="List of Chromebooks Supporting Android Apps" href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-android-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">selected models</a> only. Moreover, the apps on Play Store aren&#8217;t fully optimized for the Chromebooks, so if you are planning to use the android apps on your Chromebook, then make sure to get the touch-enabled one.</li>
<li>If you are looking for a cheap laptop to work on the MS Office, then definitely Windows laptop is the only option, as Chrome OS doesn&#8217;t support it yet. However, if you rely on Google&#8217;s suite of applications heavily and have to work online mostly, then nothing can beat Chromebooks at that. Chromebooks are also fast and battery efficient than Windows laptops as Chrome OS is a very lightweight cloud-based operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more differences between them, but these are the major ones.&nbsp;You can check out this guide on <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3280998/laptop-computers/chromebooks-versus-windows-laptops-which-should-you-buy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromebooks vs Windows Laptops</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;more in-depth&nbsp;idea about it.&nbsp;Keep your needs in mind and then decide whether you should buy a Chromebook under $200 or Windows laptop under $200.</p>
</div>

<p>So, now as you have decided what type of laptop you want to&nbsp;buy for yourself,&nbsp;we can proceed with the list of best laptops to buy under your budget of 200 dollars.</p>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Note -</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px">All budget laptops under $200 come with a very little amount of internal storage (64GB at most) so to buy a laptop with more storage (500GB or 1TB HDD), we recommend you to increase your budget a bit and have a look at <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops Under $300" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-under-300-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our guide to buy the best laptop under $300</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laptops under $100? Do they really exist?&nbsp;The answer is YES! There are few laptop manufacturers who are offering laptops for the price as low as 100 dollars. But, finding a best cheap laptop isn&#8217;t an easy task as there are very&nbsp;few &#8220;box packed new laptops&#8221; available in this price range so buying a refurbished laptop is the only way to crack a deal here.

<p>Technology is improving every day and to cope up with all the latest technologies in the market, laptop manufacturers launch new laptop models with minor improvements to its predecessor laptops. As a result, the older laptops which are still great performers get huge price cuts when newer laptops are launched in the market. And, this is what makes buying older laptops still worthy. Well if we talk about <strong>buying the laptops under $100 budget</strong> specifically then you will hardly find any new laptops in this price range because one hundred&nbsp;dollars isn&#8217;t enough to buy a device like a laptop. But still, there&nbsp;are few refurbished laptops to buy under $100 which will&nbsp;let you do&nbsp;basic works like editing documents, making presentations, surfing the internet and other low performance requiring&nbsp;works. Yes, we will have a look at the list of best cheap laptops in a while&nbsp;but before that&#8230;</p>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want a MacBook for under $100? Well, you might not be able to buy the latest MacBook with this budget, but a refurbished 2013 MacBook, you surely can.</p>
<p>Being such an old machine, it is still one of the best-looking laptops you can buy for under $100. Its body is finished in white color, and its lid has Apple logo that lights up when you start the computer. As far as performance of the laptop is concerned, you can use this laptop for all sorts of productivity works, but playing games won&#8217;t be a good experience on this laptop because of its old hardware.</p>
<p>Even it runs a very old version of macOS which might limit you from using some modern apps on this MacBook. But overall, this MacBook is a great deal if you&#8217;re looking for a cheap productivity machine under $100.</p>

<p>The Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 is yet another variant from the Surface series of laptops from Microsoft which we recommend to artists. Although the device, doesn’t come with a detachable screen like other Surface devices, it still has the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Microsoft’s proprietary PixelSense 13.5&#8243; touchscreen technology</span>. And,&nbsp;thanks to its <strong>color-accurate display and the support of Surface Pen</strong>, this laptop can be used for drawing and other graphic artworks.</p>
<p>However, we won&#8217;t recommend Surface Laptop 3 to someone who is looking for a proper drawing laptop. It can be a great secondary machine for artists for everyday productivity and random drawing and editing work.</p>

<p>Most photographers have an initial thought of buying a desktop instead of the laptop for photo editing, and we also know that many of you are still confused about making the right choice between them. So, let us begin by discussing this in a little context to help you decide whether desktops or laptops are good for photo editing.</p>

	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Desktops vs Laptops: What is&nbsp;best for Photo Editing?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Both laptops and desktops have their pros and cons. So, what&#8217;s best for you depends on your profession and your working style &#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re a traveling photographer then definitely the choice for you would be the laptop as traveling with the desktop is not possible. Hence, you will need a lightweight and powerful laptop to view and edit your captured photos on the go.</li>
<li>Whereas, if you are a designer or have to work from a fixed place, then I would recommend you to buy the desktop for your photo editing works because desktops are cheaper, &#8220;more powerful&#8221; and also easy to upgrade than laptops.</li>
</ul>
<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#333333;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#666666;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">Don't get me wrong,</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"></p>
<p>Laptops are also powerful, but the processors inside the laptops are mobile variants, so they are clocked to work at lower speeds to deliver better battery backup. However, this isn&#8217;t a problem with <a title="Intel Processor Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/intel-processor-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by newer generation processors</a> because newer generation mobile processors significantly reduce that&nbsp;performance gap between desktops and laptops.</p>
<p>Even the newer mobile GPUs are powerful enough to easily carry out intensive photo editing work on laptops using softwares like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.</p>
<p></div></div>
<p>So,&nbsp;buying a laptop&nbsp;for photo editing isn&#8217;t a bad choice at all, but the only thing you need to know is, you will trade in a little performance for the portability you get in the&nbsp;laptop. Whereas, desktops are best at delivering raw performance.</p>
</div>

<p>Now it&#8217;s totally up to you as you know what&#8217;s right for you and what isn&#8217;t. So, if you opted for a desktop then probably we should say each other a goodbye because we are not going to talk about desktops here.</p>

	</div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Important Things to Check in the&nbsp;Laptop for Photographers and Photo Editing</h3>
<hr>
<p>We do have&nbsp;our expert&#8217;s recommended best&nbsp;laptops for photo editing listed below which will not require you to check anything, but if you opt to buy any laptop which is not&nbsp;in our list below then make sure&nbsp;to check these things in the laptop to make it a perfect buy for photo editing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel i5 or i7 Processor &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;The CPU plays a vital role in deciding the overall performance of any computer. And, for running power demanding softwares like Photoshop you&#8217;ll need a powerful CPU. We recommend you to get the <a title="Best i5 Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i5-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptop with newer generation Intel i5</a> or <a title="Best i7 Laptop" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i7-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">i7 processor</a>. The <a title="Best i3 Laptops" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-i3-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laptops powered by Intel Core i3 processor</a> can also work well if you are a beginner in this field, but for future proofing it is better to invest in a laptop with Intel Core i5 processor.</li>
<li><strong>At least 8GB of RAM &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>As a professional photo editor or photographer, you&#8217;ll be working with multiple files and programs simultaneously. So, to make sure that your laptop always runs smoothly while editing photos, we recommend at least 8GB of RAM in the laptop for photo editing. Also, check for the extra RAM slots so that if required you can increase the RAM of your laptop in the future.</li>
<li><strong>256GB or more &#8220;SSD&#8221; Storage &#8211;</strong> As a photographer, you&#8217;ll click a lot of pictures from your DSLR camera and the average size of each image captured from DSLR cameras is about 15MB, so you will need a lot of storage space to store all of them. You can buy a laptop with 1TB of hard drive which will allow you to save all your photos on the laptop, but we recommend you to buy a laptop with SSD. Get the laptop with a 256GB or if your budget allows 512GB SSD and buy an external hard drive to keep the backup of the images you&#8217;ve completed editing. We recommend SSD because SSDs are faster than hard drives and it also improves the overall performance of the laptop.</li>
<li><strong>2GB or More Dedicated Graphics &#8211;&nbsp;</strong> These days we don&#8217;t need the dedicated graphics card in a laptop for photo editing because integrated graphics on newer processors can also handle intensive softwares without any problems, but we recommend to have at least 2GB of dedicated graphics because it will help while editing high-resolution photos. However, if you have to deal with extremely high-resolution images and also some video editing work occasionally, then we would recommend you to get a better graphics backed laptop. Nvidia&#8217;s MX250 GPU is great for mediocre photo editing work, but for high-resolution photos and video editing, we recommend Nvidia&#8217;s GTX and RTX line of GPUs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Full HD Display with Good&nbsp;Color Accuracy &#8211;</strong> Last but not least, the display of the laptop for photo editing should be bright and the one that displays accurate colors (check sRGB rating). We recommend display with full HD resolution (i.e. 1920 x 1080) for normal editing work, but if you have to edit very high resolution images then you&#8217;ll need a laptop with 4K display (i.e. 3840 x 2160) for editing such photos.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. LG Gram 17 <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Large Screen Option</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3bgsM9j" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/LG-Gram-17.jpg" alt="LG Gram 17 - best large screen laptop for photo editing" width="550" height="416"></a></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t want to miss the standard PC feel, the LG Gram 17 is a perfect option. It comes with a large <strong>17-inch IPS display with 114% of color gamut</strong> and powerful hardware which makes it the best 17-inch laptop for photo editing right now. Its chassis is made from the special metal alloy and it complies with the 810G Military Standard so it is perfect for photographers who travels a lot and has to edit pictures on-the-go. Moreover, it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">world&#8217;s lightest 17-inch laptop</span> weighing in at just 2.9 pounds, so you won&#8217;t be lugging this laptop around like other 17-inch laptops.</p>
<p>The colorful display and portable chassis isn&#8217;t all the laptop has got. It also comes with an equally tempting set of powerful configuration making it a very good laptop for photoshop. With its powerful Intel Core i7 processor paired up with a massive 16GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD, the LG Gram 17 laptop can handle quite a lot of tasks with ease.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about the price tag, the laptop costs around $1800 and for the price it offers an excellent package overall, but it comes with Intel&#8217;s integrated Iris Plus graphics. That said, it can still handle all sorts of photo editing work on Photoshop or Lightroom without any problems, but it would struggle if you would try to edit videos on it. So, if you are looking for a large screen laptop solely for photo editing only, then LG Gram 17 is probably the best option right now.</p>

<h3>5. Apple MacBook Pro 16 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best MacBook for Photo Editing</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_5926" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://amzn.to/2S8bfZG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5926" class="wp-image-5926 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Apple-MacBook-Pro-16.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16 - Best Laptop for Professional Photographers" width="550" height="319"></a><p id="caption-attachment-5926" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Best Compact and High-end Laptop for Professional Photographers</strong></p></div>
<p>Have you ever been to a professional photographer or video producer&#8217;s studio? The chances of they using a Mac is way higher than using a Windows-based laptop. That said, Apple’s MacBooks and iMacs are widely used for handling high-end graphics tools for image and video processing. And here is a compact yet, very powerful MacBook Pro 15, which comes with a stunning <strong>16-inch True Tone Retina display with 3072 x 1920 Resolution</strong>.</p>
<p>For the internals, it is powered by the latest generation six-core Intel Core i7 processor paired up with a 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. This not only provides seamless multitasking, but also provides a very fast and reliable storage option. For the graphics, the laptop comes with dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 5300M GPU, which boosts up the graphics handling performance of the laptop.</p>
<p>The laptop comes with an all-metal unibody chassis, which gives it a premium look and feel. Moreover, this MacBook comes with a powerful set of photo and video editing tools including <strong>huge trackpad and the touch bar above the keyboard which aids a lot while editing photos in Photoshop on this laptop</strong>.</p>
<p>However, not everything about the MacBook Pro is praiseworthy. It has just 4 ports, 2 on either side and all of them are Thunderbolt USB Type-C. So, to transfer photos from your camera to the laptop you will need a dongle which isn&#8217;t included in the box. Moreover, its price is also comparatively higher than the similarly specced Windows laptops. That said, the MacBook Pro 15 is still one of the most preferred laptop by professionals because of its performance and reliability.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#e5e54c;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#FFFF66;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;">If you think you can make it with the small display, then <strong>MacBook Pro 13</strong> is also an excellent pick for photo editing. While it doesn&#8217;t come with dedicated GPU, the integrated Intel Iris graphics 655 on it is also more than enough for photo editing. So, if you want to save a bit and think that you will be fine with a smaller display, then MacBook Pro 13 is also worth checking out. | <a href="https://amzn.to/3bhQ2nn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check price on Amazon</a></div></div>

<h3>6. HP ENVY 13t 4K Laptop <span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best Value for Money</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2SaVD7v" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4032 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HP-Envy-13t.jpg" alt="HP Envy 13t - best laptop for photoshop with 4K display under 1000" width="584" height="376"></a></p>
<p>The HP Envy 13 is one of our most recommended laptops for photographers who have to edit pictures on the go. The reason behind that is it offers 4K display in a lightweight, streamlined chassis, that too, at an affordable price. While most of the models with 4K display cost more than $1500, with this HP Envy 13, you can get it for around $1000.</p>
<p>It comes with a 13.3-inch 4K touchscreen display which is vivid and crisp looking. Speaking about the specifications of the laptop, it comes with 8th Generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor paired with a massive 16GB of RAM. Although the processor is slightly old, it is still a competent one. It also features a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX250 GPU which makes it a very capable performer when it comes to intensive media creation and editing work. Moreover, the laptop comes with a 512GB of SSD, which we think is more than enough for a photographer’s needs.</p>
<p>However, the battery backup of this laptop isn’t that great. It can last up to 5 to 6 hours on a single charge which could fall short if you travel a lot. But on an overall note, this HP Envy 13 laptop still offers excellent value for its price, and it is a complete package for budget buyers who don’t want to compromise on features.</p>

<p>It is evident that there is hardly a difference of around 10-20fps in the gameplay of graphics intensive games in both these segments of laptops. Moreover, all three games are playable on the Acer Predator Helios 300 in ultra settings with fps ranging around 60-70fps, and that is not at all disappointing. Moreover, you can scale down a few settings to add up of about 10-15fps for more smoother gameplay.</p>

<p>Well, a&nbsp;gaming laptop under 1000 dollars can do most of the tasks efficiently, but&nbsp;a laptop priced at around 1500 dollars can provide a better graphics output and performance.

<p>Here comes the best pure gaming based laptop in the list, the Dell Alienware m17. Alienware series of laptops from Dell are very well renowned in the market for their impeccable and uninterrupted gaming performance.</p>
<p>This is the newest Alienware 17.3-inch laptop which sports a 1080p IPS display with brightness up to 300-nits. It can satisfy almost all the core laptop users including the hardcore gamers. The laptop is powered by the newest 9th generation Intel core i7 processor clocked up to 4.5GHz. Multitasking on the laptop is driven by a 16GB of fast DDR4 RAM which is ample for playing games and in case if you need more RAM then it also has an extra slot to upgrade the RAM up to 32GB. As far as storage is concerned, it has a spacious 512GB SSD which will be sufficient for most gamers however, if you want more storage then storage drives are easily accessible to upgrade.</p>
<p>Graphics on this laptop are also very well managed. It has Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card with 6GB of DDR6 memory. This laptop can run all the latest games without any problem, and it manages to stay cool all the times hence it has managed to top our list of the best gaming laptops under 1500 dollars.</p>
<p>The only downside — Alienware m17 has huge dimensions and it weighs around 6 pounds which makes it hard to travel with and carry to different places. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a smaller and portable gaming laptop, then you should probably check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/gaming-laptops-desktops/new-alienware-m15-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Alienware m15</a> which is equally powerful and far more portable than the Alienware m17.</p>

<p>The recently updated Acer Aspire 5 is not just a spec bump but it&#8217;s a complete overhaul when compared to its <a title="Acer Aspire E5-575G-53VG Review – A Worthy Buy at a Budget" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/acer-aspire-e5-575g-53vg-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predecessor</a>. It comes with the Intel&#8217;s newest 10th Gen processor which brings significant improvement in its performance and that makes it one of the best all-purpose laptops in $600 price range right now.</p>
<p>It sports the silver color body and comes with a textured lid, so there&#8217;s nothing remarkable about its design, but overall it is a nice professional&nbsp;looking laptop. It comes with a 15.6-inch full HD IPS display with a standard 16:9 aspect ratio which has very good viewing angles. Backed by a mighty 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX250 graphics card, which makes Acer Aspire 5 a perfect gaming laptop under $600. The laptop is also powered by the powerful 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, which is well-known for its performance and power saving capabilities.&nbsp;It has 8GB of RAM and massive 512GB solid-state&nbsp;drive for storage.</p>
<p>However, the only thing that bothers a bit is its price, which is a slightly higher than $600. That said, it is an excellent all-around performer and we think it&#8217;s worth spending extra for the added features and functionalities.</p>
