										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking to get a 13-inch laptop for yourself but are still confused with so many options with different screen sizes? Well, that is what we are here for. Right from Windows laptops like Dell’s XPS series and Surface Book 2 to Apple&#8217;s MacBook Pro, there are a lot of best 13-inch laptops available to buy, but the first thing that you should keep in mind is your use case scenario. For instance, a student has different needs than, say a businessman or a writer.</p>
<p>With that in mind, indulge us in explaining what to look for when deciding a screen-size for your next laptop.</p>
<p>All the 15 and <a title="Top 10 Best 17 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Large Screen Laptops of 2020" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-17-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17-inch laptops</a> are powerful but at the same time, carrying them on-the-go is a real task, let alone working in transit. The other thing to note is based on a simple fact that not all users require a large screen laptop that excels in brute force. Sure the 15-inchers have a decent sized screen to play around and are packed with great hardware, but imagine a writer or a businessman working on a powerful 15-inch laptop without actually using it to its full capabilities.</p>
<p>Next up, the <a title="Top 10 Best 11 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Ultraportable Laptops of 2020" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-11-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultraportable 11-inch laptops</a> which are built for working on-the-go are strikingly underpowered. While these laptops offer users with portability, they cannot be depended upon for productivity tasks as they lack in performance.</p>
<p>So, what is the optimal screen-size that also makes up a well-balanced laptop?</p>
<p><em>It’s the 13-inch laptops.</em></p>
<p>Laptops that have a 13-inch display are more comfortable to carry along as they are lightweight, though that doesn’t mean that they compromise on power. They are very well equipped to handle tasks ranging from simple writing to editing pictures and videos and even gaming.</p>
<p>To make it easy for our readers, we have handpicked a select few 13-inch laptops that we consider to be the best portable laptops one can buy right now.</p>

<h3 id="L1">1. Dell XPS 13 <span class="su-label su-label-type-success">Best Overall</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9300-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5951 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dell-XPS-13-9300.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 - best 13 inch laptop 2020" width="550" height="342"></a></p>
<p>Quite possibly the smallest 13-inch laptop, Dell XPS 13 is an elegant machine, one that’s equally powerful. The XPS 13 comes in different configurations for users to choose from. Starting from around $900 right up to $2000, the XPS 13 offers a choice between 13.3-inch full HD+ (touch or non-touch) Infinity Edge display or a 13.3-inch 4K UHD+ (3840 x 2400 pixels) InfinityEdge Touch display.</p>
<p>However, based on the type of usage, user’s can upgrade a few components. For regular to mid-level use case scenarios, the <em><strong>XPS 13 with 10th generation Intel Core i5-1035G1 processor is a value for money option</strong></em>. However, for a little more demanding tasks we would suggest to go with the variant with 10th generation Intel Core i7-1065G7 processor. Similarly, 8GB RAM with 256GB SSD makes up for a fairly good configuration but users have an option to choose up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB SSD. Like we mentioned earlier, the most value for money proposition is the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9300-laptop/xn9300cto220sv1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XPS 13 with Core i5 and 8GB of RAM</a> which fulfills the needs of students and businessmen alike.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 (2020) comes in two color variants, standard platinum silver with black carbon fiber palm-rest and all-new frost finish with alpine white woven glass fiber palm-rest. The body of the laptop is crafted from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CNC milled aluminum</span> and the display is topped with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 6. The XPS 13 has a full-size chiclet keyboard which is backlit. All of this makes the Dell XPS 13 the most balanced 13-inch laptop out there, don’t let that slim form factor make you think otherwise.</p>

<blockquote><p>The 2020 Dell XPS 13 with our recommended specs — Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD cost well over $1200, however, if you don&#8217;t mind a year-old model, then it gets you the same specs for under $1000! You get the similar 13.3-inch infinity edge display; however, it comes with standard full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution, which is still excellent for everyday usage and on par with other laptops in the segment. As far as hardware specifications is concerned, you can configure the 2019 XPS 13 with up to 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and 2TB of PCIe NVMe SSD. So, if you want to save, then this is a more value deal on one of our most favorite 13-inch laptop. | <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7989821/type/dlg/sid/laptopunderbudget-20/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/13/spd/xps-13-7390-laptop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Check Price on Dell</a></p></blockquote>
<h3 id="L2">2. Microsoft Surface Book 2&nbsp;<span class="su-label su-label-type-warning">Best 2-in-1</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Xq96bC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3074 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Microsoft-Surface-Book-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft Surface Book 2 - best 2 in 1 13 inch laptop" width="550" height="388"></a></p>
<p>The Surface Book 2 is a super portable laptop that is also easier to work on when in transit. It features a 13.3-inch PixelSense display which is touch supported. The display can also be detached from the rest of the body leaving the Surface Book in a tablet mode. Throw in the Surface Precision Mouse, Surface Pen, and Surface Dial, and it becomes a <a title="The Best Laptops for Drawing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Artists" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine fit for creators</a>.</p>
<p>For about $1300, you get a 13.3-inch display, 8th generation Intel Core i5 processor with 256GB storage and 8GB of RAM. This setup is powerful and can handle intensive applications like Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Autodesk SketchBook among others. For power users, the Surface Book 2 can also be configured with 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor and a dedicated Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU which can even churn through titles like Forza 7 with ease (<a href="https://microsoft.msafflnk.net/yoZAb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Configure yours at Microsoft</a>).</p>
<p>Overall, it is a perfect 2-in-1 13-inch laptop for college students or for the people interested in art and designing. However, its steeper price tag may not make it a right fit for everyone&#8217;s budget here.</p>

<p>The <strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 3</strong> is also a great option if you prefer the clamshell design over 2-in-1 (convertible). The laptop comes with an aluminum casing and interior of the laptop comes finished in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">soft Alcantara</span>. It comes with 13.5-inch touchscreen PixelSense display with slightly less resolution (2256 x 1504), but, it is equally bright and colorful panel as Surface Book 2.

<h3 id="L3">3. Apple MacBook Pro 13</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2IlkPCu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3994 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-2018.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 13 - best 13 inch macbook" width="600" height="570"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the default 13-inch laptop for people looking to invest in a MacBook. The MacBook Pro 13 is a beast as it comes with the powerful 8th gen Intel processors and a touch bar which is standard across all the 13&#8243; models now. The MacBook Pro is available with up to 16GB of memory, 4.7GHz Turbo Boost courtesy of Intel’s new chipsets, up to 3.2GB/s SSD read speeds depending upon the storage option you choose (128GB/256GB/512GB) which can further be customized up to 2TB. All of this is backed by up to 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it have the perfect combination of beauty and brains? Now, we get that a few of you might be thinking to go with the MacBook Air. Well, it&#8217;s also a great machine but only if you don&#8217;t need pro-level hardware. The new MacBook Air is powered by the Y-series Intel chips which are good enough for everyday productivity tasks, but for anything more than that it will be highly underpowered. That said, it&#8217;s still good enough for students or anyone who wants a portable 13-inch MacBook with retina display.</p>
<p>Coming back to the MacBook Pro, it also features a new True Tone Retina display which adjusts the color according to ambient lighting for the better viewing experience. However, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">if you have to edit photos</a> or do anything that requires to see the accurate colors, then you might have to turn the True Tone feature off. The MacBook Pro 13 powered by 8th gen Intel Core i5 processor with Touch Bar and Touch ID starts at $1,299. For those who want the most powerful 13-inch MacBook, the top-of-the-line model costs $2,499 and comes with 512GB of SSD storage.</p>

<p>A beautiful laptop from the house of HP, the Envy 13t features an all-aluminum design which helps in keeping the laptop durable but lightweight. As such, the laptop weighs just 2.71 lb. It is also extremely thin at 0.59 inches. The hinge of the Envy 13t has also been completely modified and now features this new design which elevates the base of the laptop a bit to make way for air flow. This in turn also raises the keyboard a bit which enables an ergonomic typing experience.</p>
<p>The Envy 13t is available in many configuration sets. The default configuration which costs under $1000, comprises of an 10th Gen Intel Core i7-10510U processor backed by UHD Graphics and 8GB of RAM. It rocks a beautiful 13.3-inch full HD display with narrow bezels and 256GB of SSD storage, making it one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best value for money 13-inch laptop</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Adding in $80, users can upgrade to dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX250 2GB graphics which would make it a much capable ultrabook, while for $160 over the default price you get an additional 8GB of RAM, totaling it to 16.</p>
<p>If a user wants the touchscreen on the Envy 13t, they can get it for an additional $50 but that’s not even it. HP allows you to go way past the full HD display which is why users can upgrade to a touch 13.3-inch 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels) IPS edge-to-edge display for $140 more.</p>
<p>All in all, the HP Envy 13t is a gorgeous and a very apt 13-inch laptop that packs one of the most powerful processors. It’s customizable as well, so it&#8217;s a win-win for consumers.</p>

This isn&#8217;t a workhorse laptop to run the demanding apps, but it is the perfect option for those whose work is mostly internet oriented. It offers a 13.3-inch 1080p IPS touch display which has great viewing angles, and it can be rotated to use it as a tablet. Moreover, its battery can last up to 12 hours on a single charge. What else do you want?</p>

<p>However, performance is where IdeaPad 730S completely outshines the MacBook Air. It comes powered by the latest Whiskey Lake Intel processors which are a lot powerful than the Y-series Intel processors on MacBook Air. Moreover, it also costs a lot less than the entry-level MacBook Air!</p>

<p>Going by its name, the Gram 13 from LG weighs in just under a kilogram or specifically 2.13 lbs. It features a 13.3-inch full HD IPS display that supports touch input. The Gram 13 is powered by 8th gen Intel Core i5 processor which is backed by 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>
<p>The LG Gram 13 is an extremely light laptop with its body made from an alloy of carbon and magnesium and as such we understand the accompanying durability factor. However, the Gram 13 is MIL-STD-810 certified, so it&#8217;s durable and provides up to 20 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p>
<p>The LG Gram 13 costs around $1000, so it definitely offers a lot more than its other counterparts like Dell XPS 13 but its <strong>USB-C port doesn&#8217;t support Thunderbolt 3 connections</strong>.</p>

<p>Hands down the <em><strong>best 13-inch gaming laptop available today</strong></em>. Razer makes gaming laptops that are a dream of every gamer in the world. The Razer Blade Stealth is no different. It features a 13.3-inch display with full HD or 4K resolution and it has wide viewing angles and excellent color reproduction. The keyboard which the company calls Chroma Keyboard supports 16.8 million colors. A different color for each key and you&#8217;re still left with millions.</p>
<p>The Blade Stealth is crafted from aircraft-grade aluminum and is then CNC milled that results in this sleek, 0.58-inch beautiful machine. The laptop is powered by 8th gen Intel Core i7-8565U processor with up to 4.6 GHz on Turbo Boost. This is further supported by 16GB of RAM and SSD storage of your choice (256GB, 512GB or 1TB).</p>
<p>As far as graphics are concerned, it has a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX150 GPU which is efficacious for everyday productivity tasks and light photo editing. However, if you need more power, then this ultrabook also comes with GTX 1650 Max-Q GPU or it can be converted into a complete beast by plugging in the Razer Core X external GPU which of course costs extra (<a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-core-x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$300 at Razer Store</a> + GPU of your choice).</p>
<p>So, the Razer Blade Stealth 13 is not only a perfect coffee table laptop, but it&#8217;s also a well-suited machine for power users and gamers when connected to the eGPU. However, all these bells and whistles come with a premium price tag which can go up to $2500 or even more, making it out of reach of budget buyers.</p>

<p>Well, that was a really long list of laptops that currently rule the best 13-inch laptops space. From the default option as the Dell XPS 13 and MacBook Pro 13 to Razer Blade Stealth 13 which we think is the best 13-inch gaming laptop available today. For students, we suggest the Asus ZenBook UX331FA laptop because of its affordable price tag while for business professionals, we think the HP Envy 13t or Spectre x360 is going to be perfect as it has the premiumness that&#8217;s often reflective of a business person.</p>
<p>There are many other options in the above list with some for budget buyers such as ASUS Chromebook C300SA and Acer Chromebook R13, which are great for surfing the web and checking emails. Then there is the premium 2-in-1 laptop with pen support like Microsoft Surface Book 2, which is well-suited for artists and designers.</p>
<p>As we have also said before, deciding which laptop to buy can be a tedious task. Knowing your personal use case can aid you in choosing the best 13-inch laptop that fits your requirements and lifestyle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thin and lights embody the very philosophy of portable computers. Dell’s XPS 13 ticks off the portable aspect of it by being light to carry around, not taking up too much space. But in the bid to achieve the zero size figure, most thin and lights compromise the very essence of a computer — The computing power. Not the Dell XPS 13 though. The thin and light is called the “world’s smallest 13-inch laptop” with a nearly bezel-less display and an extremely portable form factor. It enjoys a monopoly in the thin and light ultrabooks, a go-to choice for creatives and professionals, but it’s not without competition now. HP’s Spectre 13, which is priced similarly is equally small, portable and powerful. There’s also HP’s Envy lineup of premium ultrabooks. Then there are the Macbooks that are the go-to choice for the Apple fanboys.</p>
<p>Now in its redesigned avatar, the Dell XPS 13 is even more powerful. You get the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor with the option of expandable memory up to 16GB. Integrated Intel UHD graphics along with a 256GB SSD and 64-bit Windows 10 Home, all in a 13.3-inch chassis that looks every bit as premium. Does the Dell XPS 13 retain the numero uno position among ultrabooks for the second time? Let’s find out.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is subtly redesigned but the changes tantamount to significant benefits. It retains the white interior with rose gold accents on the outside and can be distinctly made out from the crop of generic ultrabooks. Dell has also experimented with other color options including the popular carbon fiber design. The rose gold variant is pricier than the normal carbon-fiber one. That’s because Dell claims to put extra effort into making the white variant last longer. Apparently, the wear and tear over time on the rose-gold and white variant is lesser. The material is a woven texture that you can feel when your fingers brush the body. My eyes are still on the carbon-fiber black variant, but this one also feels quite premium.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4249 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Dell-XPS-13-exterior-design.jpg" alt="Dell XPS 13 2018 - exterior design" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The look and feel of the exterior and interior are largely the same as before, with subtle differences. I particularly like the glass-woven touchpad that gives the laptop a unique look, but it’s also retained from last year. The white material used doesn’t really retain fingerprints. Dell claims the material will not turn yellowish with stains over time.</p>
<p>The body isn’t quite perfect though. The flex in the display is more than what was there last time, although you’ll only feel the flex if you are deliberately bending the body. The keyboard, though, has more flex than before. But the average user will have no problem using the laptop. It becomes problematic when you consider the price and the competition. There is no flex whatsoever in the new MacBooks which are sturdily built and feel like a piece of stone, although they are also larger and heavier.</p>
<p>The chassis is still the same size, but Dell has managed to shrink the bezels even more. The biggest quirk is the positioning of the webcam. It’s still at the same annoying spot like the last time. The thin bezels leave no room for the webcam up top, so Dell put it below the display, which doesn’t really work like normal web-cams. You see, when you’re in a Skype call, the person on the other end will see your nose-first, not the best profile of a person to see through a screen, to be honest. The webcam focuses more on the neck, chin and nostrils, more than the face which should be the norm in the age of YouTube and Skype. And if you dare type something while on a Skype call, your gnarly fingers will get more precedence, followed by your nostrils and then your face. This is kind of a deal-breaker if you find yourself in Skype calls more often. Dell did have a chance to address this issue, and it’s sad to see Dell being nonchalant about it. Addressing it would have made the Dell XPS 13 one of the perfect Windows laptops, if not the best.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 also comes in a lower variant that has one key feature missing — A touchscreen. It’s offered by almost every ultrabook at this price point that runs Windows. That said, only the 4K display variant of Dell XPS 13&nbsp; offers a touchscreen, which has its own trade-off. You see, you’re not only paying more for a touchscreen but being a 4K display, the battery life will also be lesser. One would expect a touchscreen at this price point, and having to pay more could be a bummer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best 13 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Portable Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-13-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best 13-inch Laptops &#8211; Our Most Recommended Portable Laptops</a></strong></p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>The primary reason to get the Dell XPS 13 is its brilliant 4K display. There are marginally thinner bezels than last time and it just looks awesome. The panel is also quite bright registering an average of 400 nits across the panel. Since this is an IPS panel, you’ll have no problem viewing content from sharp angles. Thanks to the high resolution, all sorts of content, whether you’re watching a video, editing a photo, streaming Netflix or reading an article — Everything looks brilliantly immersive. In fact, you can stream content in 4K as the panel will support it. The display is also a bit glossy, so if you’re using it in an area with bright lights, there will be some reflection off the screen.</p>
<p>One big quirk of having a 4K panel is that anything other than video (text, menus, etc.) look tiny on the large resolution screen. Furthermore, keeping the screen on native 4K resolution also sucks more battery. Instead, if you stick to the 1080p variant, you’re not going to lose out on sharpness as the effective pixel density is still more than enough to induce high contrast, wide color gamut and precise color accuracy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photo Editing</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a higher contrast display, you can choose between the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book 2 and the Asus Zenbook S — All three of which have trade-offs that won’t quite bode well with enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Overall, the 4K display of the Dell XPS 13 is the highlight here, but you can also make do with the 1080p panel easily and feel little to no difference whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>Just like the design and the display, the keyboard of the Dell XPS 13 has also gone through a redesign. The change includes better key travel and feedback. The XPS 13 retains the chiclet island-style layout for the keyboard. The size of the keys are larger and it’s easy to get accustomed to typing on this keyboard. The positioning of the up and down arrow keys are a little too small, for my fingers through and it took some time to get used to the positioning of them. More often than not, my fingers would hit the PgUp and PgDn keys located dangerously close to the arrow keys. If you’re used to editing video or playing the games, it’ll be especially difficult to master.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4250 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-interior-design.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 - keyboard, touchpad and display" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>The keyboard is also backlit, making it easy to work in the dark and despite the redesign, the keyboard feels just as good. The key travel is more or less identical to the last time (which was perfect). It’s only a bit firmer and feels less mushy and more tactile. At least it’s far better than the new keyboard on the MacBook Pro or even the Surface Book 2.</p>

<p>Dell offers two levels of backlighting on the keyboard and on the white variant, the keys aren’t uniformly lit. The power button on the keyboard doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. It’s the same as what Apple does on its MacBook Pro. There is also a Windows Hello support, but owing to the odd placement of the webcam, it’s slightly problematic to use. Basically, to make Windows Hello work properly, you have to tilt your head downwards and have ample lighting.</p>
<p>The touchpad, on the other hand, remains just as good. It’s a bit constrained as compared to other 13-inch laptops and that’s because Dell has given preference to a larger keyboard. The touchpad, made of a glass-woven texture feels smooth and perfectly responsive. It supports the full suite of Windows Precision Touchpad along with the multi-finger gestures. Even the buttons press down easily with an audible click and a hearty feedback. Easily one of the best trackpads on a Windows laptop.</p>
<h3>Ports &amp; Connectivity</h3>
<p>A small form-factor means the Dell XPS 13 compromises on the connectivity front. The I/O options available are few and you’ll have to resort to a dongle-tangled life to make the most out of this premium ultrabook.</p>
<p>In the Dell XPS 13, you won’t get the standard USB-Type A port and neither will you get an SD card slot. Instead, there are a bunch of USB-Type C ports — Three USB 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C ports, out of which two support Thunderbolt 3 while the other one has DisplayPort capabilities. Thankfully, the chassis is wide enough to house a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along with a microphone jack. Instead of an SD card slot, you get a microSD card reader (they aren’t really interchangeable, Dell!). To compensate for the lack of diversity in connectivity, Dell offers a Type-A USB dongle out of the box, but it doesn’t offer a multi-port dongle as the HP Spectre does.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>The Windows experience on Dell XPS 13 isn&#8217;t as pleasant and bloatfree as Microsoft devices. It comes pre-installed with some serious RAM eating apps from Dell which however helps to keep the drivers and BIOS up to date and let users tweak system&#8217;s performance. There are also some not so useful and annoying promotional apps which starts automatically at startup. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s just a few minutes of work to uninstall all of them and get a pure Windows experience.</p>
<p>Our review unit came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home which is the standard operating system Dell XPS 13 ships with. However, if you&#8217;re buying it for professional uses then there&#8217;s also a $50 option to get it with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also an option of Ubuntu for the <a title="The Best Linux Laptops – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Ubuntu &amp; Other Linux Distros" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-linux-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people who prefer using Linux operating system</a>. You can purchase the Dell XPS 13 developer edition which ships with the latest Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a flagship performer in the thin and light segment. That legacy continues with the latest iteration. The 2018 Dell XPS 13 runs on the 8th Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The highest variant is powered by the Core i7-8550U. It’s the ultrabook variant of the processor that has lower power consumption. It also powers most of the premium ultrabooks we have seen this year and the performance is more or less the same as them. You can pretty much run anything on the laptop, provided they are not graphically intensive. There’s ample memory on offer with up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM along with up to massive 2TB of PCIe based SSD. There’s enough room for high-intensity multi-tasking including spreading tasks across multiple desktops which Windows 10 supports beautifully.</p>

<p>The thermal envelope of the 15W Intel Processor is increased and the Dell XPS 13 relies on a dual fan cooling system to eke more out of the processor. The chipset can retain higher speeds for longer and while running stressful tasks, it’s apparent that the Dell XPS 13 can maintain clock speeds in boost state for longer periods, as compared to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Although, the speed did go down from a high 3.0GHz to 2.2GHz in less than five minutes under duress. At full load for half an hour, the Dell XPS 13 maintained clock speeds in the range of 1.8GHz to 1.88GHz. It’s quite impressive what this small notebook can do. On the other hand, notebooks like the HP Spectre x360 (2018) cycle around 1.6GHz to 1.7GHz.</p>
<div id="attachment_4246" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-image-4246 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-cinebench-r15.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - cinebench r15" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Cinebench R15 Multi Core Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On Cinebench R15 (Multi-core), the Dell XPS 13 score the highest with around 640 points, as compared to 615 in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and 425 in the Spectre x360 2018.</p>
<div id="attachment_4247" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-image-4247 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-pc-mark-8.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - pc mark 8" width="452" height="280"><p id="caption-attachment-4247" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>PCMark 8 Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On PCMark 8 Creative, the XPS 13 scored 5060, again topping the charts, beating the ThinkPad and HP Spectre x360.</p>
<div id="attachment_4248" style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-image-4248 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-3d-mark.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 - 3d mark" width="452" height="281"><p id="caption-attachment-4248" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>3DMark Sky Diver Score</strong></p></div>
<p>On 3DMark Sky Diver though, the XPS 13 lags a little behind the X1 Carbon with 3818 points as compared to 3960 on the latter.</p>
<p>While using the laptop, I felt the heat doesn’t come in the way. The keyboard never became unbearably hot (which has been a problem with ultrabooks) and that’s because of the fabric Dell is using along with the cooling system. It’s the same materials Gore-tex jackets use for insulation. As far as thermals are concerned, it works just as good as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It can easily perform a <a title="Top 10 Best Laptops for Video Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for YouTube &amp; Film Editing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-video-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavy video edit on the Premiere Pro</a> and even do some light gaming and you’ll be just fine.</p>
<h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
<p>The XPS 13 is not meant for gaming. PC games like Far Cry 5, Fallout 4, GTA V, Shadow of Tomb Raider and the likes will still run, but you won’t be able to get the best experience like you would on a <a href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/gaming-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming laptops</a>. That’s because there is no dedicated graphics on this one. It relies on integrated graphics that though is fine for doing video editing and running animation software, it’s not good enough for <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $1500 for Immersive Gaming" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1500-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-intensity gaming</a>.</p>
<p>You can easily play games like CS: GO and PUBG at lower graphics. Expect a little choppy gameplay after around 30 minutes into it as the thermal constraints kick in. Having said that, the XPS 13 provides 4 PCIe lanes on the dual Thunderbolt 3 ports which means you can use it with an eGPU, but well that&#8217;s an additional expense not favored by most.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The audio on the Dell XPS 13 is a bit weak. High bass tracks will feel a little underwhelming, although content with dialogues and voices sound just about fine. It’s not as loud as one would expect, but considering the smaller chassis, it’s commendable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MORE: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Best Laptops for Musicians and DJs</a></strong></p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to get the Dell XPS 13 is for the long battery life it provides. It’s simply the best on a thin and light. The 52Whr powers both the 4K and the 1080p variants of the laptop, which is slightly smaller than the older generation.</p>
<div id="attachment_4252" style="width: 743px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-image-4252 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dell-xps-13-9370-2018-battery-test.jpg" alt="dell xps 13 9370 2018 - battery test" width="733" height="550"><p id="caption-attachment-4252" class="wp-caption-text">Image by &#8211; forester401 on flickr</p></div>
<p>The 1080p Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 lasts around an astonishing 11-13 hours while the 4K variant will last around 9 to 10 hours. These are remarkably good numbers and I didn’t have to charge the laptop over a period of two days even while using it as my daily driver. It also tops off quite fast. The Dell XPS 13 supports USB-Type C based fast charging that recharges the battery in around two hours.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops money can buy if you’re looking for a portable powerhouse. Gamers will not be impressed by its performance and for good reason. But, creative professionals and students and in my case, a journalist, will fall in love with how sleek and light the laptop is and how long it lasts. It’s slightly pricey, yes, and the top end model doesn’t really make sense if you look at value for money for the 1080p variant. The 4K variant only makes sense if you absolutely need the extra pixels or touchscreen, which if you are a normal user isn’t all that required. It’s one of those rare cases where lower is better, not necessarily cheaper. The Dell XPS 13 is easily one of the best ultrabooks I’ve ever used.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Right of the bat, the Asus VivoBook S14 has a profile of just 0.7-inch and weighs around 3 pounds. That is as sleek as ultraportables go and the VivoBook nails in that segment. Users can work on the VivoBook S14 right out of anywhere and everywhere as they will not face any burden in carrying the laptop.</p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 is available in Icicle Golf and Star Grey colors. The back panel too has an eye-catching brushed-metal textured design which feels great in hand.</p>
<div id="attachment_3967" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-image-3967 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Review-Design-and-Build-Quality.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop Review - Design and Build Quality" width="750" height="385" /><p id="caption-attachment-3967" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Thin, Light &amp; Portable</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Overall, the laptop is well-built which shows right from the moment you pick it out of the box. Apart from a little bending here and there, the VivoBook is stiff enough and in my opinion should survive a normal drop.</p>
<p>Lift the display lid and you are presented with a chiclet keyboard. The keys themselves aren’t too “clickety” but that is a matter of personal preference and something I almost often get irked about. Having said that, it is easy to type on the laptop, fluid and precise. The Asus VivoBook S14 has one of the better chiclet keyboards out there, even better than some of the <a title="See all ASUS Laptop Reviews" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/tag/asus-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 has very thin bezels around the display which is reminiscent of the Dell XPS series. But unlike the XPS series, the VivoBook S14 here has a rather pertinent top bezel which houses the front-facing camera. The bottom bezel is the thickest of the three and has an engraved Asus logo.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) is a pretty nice looking handy notebook that you can easily carry along without all the heft that comes with other bulky laptops. More so because it doesn’t compromise on the hardware as it achieves its fundamental goal of being an ultra-portable.</p>
<h3>Display</h3>
<p>So, while we are used to smartphones with thin bezels, Asus’ lineup of its VivoBook and ZenBook series have also picked up the trend. Asus calls it their NanoEdge display. On the VivoBook S14, Asus has managed to fit in a 14-inch Full HD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) LED panel in a frame size that traditionally fits a 13-inch display. This makes for an awesome 77% screen-to-body ratio.</p>
<p>The Full HD panel has an anti-glare coating on the top which allows a wide 178-degree viewing angle possible. It also prevents reflections and shadows to hinder your viewing experience. This concoction of a Full HD panel with anti-glare coupled with its compact build seemed nearly perfect when we were consuming content on-the-go.</p>
<div id="attachment_3968" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-image-3968 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-Display-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 Review - NanoEdge Display" width="700" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-3968" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>NanoEdge Display with Ultra-Narrow Bezel</strong></em></p></div>
<p>About the display itself, the VivoBook has one of the most gorgeous displays when it comes to laptops under this budget. The panel is evenly bright, produces sharp, vivid photos and videos. Although the VivoBook S14 often manages to produce natural looking colors, it cannot reproduce the entirety of the spectrum, which is why some hues will not be accurately reproduced.</p>
<p>Asus also loads a utility, Splendid, to control the colors reproduced. From vivid to eye comfort mode, there are a lot of presets to choose from. Additionally, Asus’ Tru2Life Video technology improves and increases contrast by a whopping 150%, enhancing the video watching experience.</p>
<p>All in all, the VivoBook S14 has a great display, one which will not disappoint you when binge-watching your favorite show or movie.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the VivoBook we tested features an Intel Core i7-8550U chipset. The quad-core CPU is clocked at 1.8GHz (up to 4.0 GHz on Turbo) and is backed by 2GB of Nvidia GeForce MX 150 graphics. This configuration is supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>Now, this setup itself places it in a sweet spot, between running high demanding tasks to casual gaming. That being said, the GeForce MX 150 won’t be able to provide much relief to graphics-intensive titles so keep that in mind when making the decision.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>MORE: <a title="Top 10 Best Gaming Laptops Under $800" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-800-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Top Picks for Gaming Laptops Under $800</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>However, this hardware churns almost everything we threw at it which is all students, professionals and general media consumers think about when purchasing a laptop.</p>
<p>In our usage, we faced no problems whatsoever as far as the performance of the VivoBook S14 is considered. We were easily able to multitask, watch videos, <a title="The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edit photos on Photoshop</a> and prepare some graphics on Adobe Illustrator among other things. The VivoBook S14 did not slow down at all, nor did we see any stuttering or lags.</p>
<p>As for the software, the Asus VivoBook S14 comes loaded with Microsoft Windows 10 Home out-of-the-box.</p>
<h3>Keyboard &amp; Touchpad</h3>
<p>The chiclet keyboard on the ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) does its job though there is nothing memorable about it. Seasoned typists would not like the keyboard for its shallowness but it will work great for most. The keys are of the perfect shape and size and are backlit. Users can choose from three modes of brightness for the backlit keyboard. There is nothing wrong with the keyboard of the VivoBook S14 although if a good keyboard is a priority, there are <a title="Top 7 Best Laptops for Writers – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Writing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better options available</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_3969" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-image-3969 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Keyboard-and-Touchpad-of-ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Utrabook.jpg" alt="Keyboard and Touchpad of ASUS VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) Ultrabook" width="700" height="726" /><p id="caption-attachment-3969" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Ergonomic Backlit Keyboard</strong></em></p></div>
<p>Being a <a title="Top 10 Best 14 Inch Laptops – The Most Recommended Midsize Laptops of 2018" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-14-inch-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-inch laptop</a>, there’s a rather spacious touchpad below the keyboard which was accurate and smooth in our usage. A fingerprint reader beside the trackpad allows users to quickly log in to the laptop courtesy of Windows Hello.</p>

<h3>Ports &amp; Slots</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3971 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S-Thin-and-Light-Laptop-Ports-and-Slots.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S Thin and Light Laptop - Ports and Slots" width="955" height="143" /></p>
<p>The VivoBook S14 features a USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.1 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port along with an SD Card slot. Users will be able to connect various peripherals ranging from external displays to projectors. Sadly there’s no DVD reader/writer on the laptop, one of the drawbacks of portability.</p>
<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>
<p>Asus VivoBook S14 features a pair of 2W downward facing speakers. The laptop also supports the company’s proprietary SonicMaster technology to enhance the overall audio experience. Though being downward facing, the audio output is dampened.</p>
<div class="su-note" id="" style="border-color:#c2c2c2;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="background-color:#DCDCDC;border-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;border-radius:3px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;"><em><strong>You may like to check out: <a title="The Best Laptops for Music Production – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Music Recording &amp; DJing" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-music-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Buy the Best laptops for Music Production</a></strong></em></div></div>
<p>Taking our usage into account, we would say that the VivoBook S14 will suffice the needs of a casual media consumer and then some. Heavy media consumers may need to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Again, the display on the VivoBook S14 makes for a really good experience when watching videos on it.</p>
<h3>Battery Life</h3>
<p>We weren’t all impressed with the battery life of the Asus VivoBook S14. It’s average at best and lasted us close to four hours in our usage.</p>
<p>The VivoBook does support fast charging though so in case you start running out of juice, you can rest be assured that it won’t die on you. We were able to recharge the laptop up to 70% in a matter of just 55 minutes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3972 size-full" src="https://laptopunderbudget.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ASUS-VivoBook-S14-S410UN-NS74-Ultrabook-Review.jpg" alt="ASUS VivoBook S14 S410UN-NS74 Review" width="600" height="621" /></p>
<p>The Asus VivoBook S14 (S410UN-NS74) provides bang for the buck you spend on it. It is a beauty with brains and while it may do nothing to please a gamer, the average consumer would just love this ultraportable. It ticks all the boxes for consumers looking to purchase a laptop solely for media consumption. On the other hand, the VivoBook S14 is also a great <a title="The Best Laptops For College Students of 2018 – For Every Budget and College Majors" href="https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notebook for college going students</a>. The 8th gen Intel Core i7 processor coupled with 8GB of RAM and 2GB of graphics prowess, the VivoBook is a jack of many trades and master of some.</p>
