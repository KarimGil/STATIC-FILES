					<description><![CDATA[I am well equipped in my office but need a laptop or Chromebook (I don’t know which) for travel. All of my stuff for work is cloud based so I don’t need Microsoft. I literally just need it to access the Internet for (google, gmail, drive, etc). What do you recommend? All of these sound like they’d work but which is the best under $250?]]></description>

Hi Kayla,
For under $300, I don&#039;t think there are any good laptops that I can recommend for photo editing. They don&#039;t have power to handle those softwares. I would recommend you to increase your budget to at least $600. Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://laptopunderbudget.com/best-laptops-for-photo-editing/&quot; title=&quot;The Best Laptops for Photo Editing – Our Most Recommended Laptops for Photographers&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guide on laptops for photo editing&lt;/a&gt; we have few budget laptops listed over there.]]></description>
